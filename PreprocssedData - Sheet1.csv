i wish to state definitely that the present work the english translation of which has been authorised and approved by me is the only authentic manual of the montessori method and that the only other authentic or authorised works of mine in the english language are the montessori method and pedagogical anthropology
signed maria montessori preface if a preface is a light which should serve to illumine the contents of a volume i choose not words but human figures to illustrate this little book intended to enter families where children are growing up
i therefore recall here as an eloquent symbol helen keller and anne sullivan macy who are by their example both teachers to myself and before the world living documents of the miracle in education
in fact helen keller is a marvelous example of the phenomenon common to all human beings the possibility of the liberation of the imprisoned spirit of man by the education of the senses
here lies the basis of the method of education of which the book gives a succinct idea
if one only of the senses sufficed to make of helen keller a woman of exceptional culture and a writer who better than she proves the potency of that method of education which builds on the senses
if helen keller attained through exquisite natural gifts to an elevated conception of the world who better than she proves that in the inmost self of man lies the spirit ready to reveal itself
helen clasp to your heart these little children since they above all others will understand you
they are your younger brothers when with bandaged eyes and in silence they touch with their little hands profound impressions rise in their consciousness and they exclaim with a new form of happiness i see with my hands
they alone then can fully understand the drama of the mysterious privilege your soul has known
when in darkness and in silence their spirit left free to expand their intellectual energy redoubled they become able to read and write without having learnt almost as it were by intuition they only they can understand in part the ecstasy which god granted you on the luminous path of learning

in all civilized countries but especially in england statistics show a decrease in infant mortality
related to this decrease in mortality a corresponding improvement is to be seen in the physical development of children they are physically finer and more vigorous
it has been the diffusion the popularization of science which has brought about such notable advantages
mothers have learned to welcome the dictates of modern hygiene and to put them into practice in bringing up their children
many new social institutions have sprung up and have been perfected with the object of assisting children and protecting them during the period of physical growth
in this way what is practically a new race is coming into being a race more highly developed finer and more robust a race which will be capable of offering resistance to insidious disease
what has science done to effect this
science has suggested for us certain very simple rules by which the child has been restored as nearly as possible to conditions of a natural life and an order and a guiding law have been given to the functions of the body
for example it is science which suggested maternal feeding the abolition of swaddling clothes baths life in the open air exercise simple short clothing quiet and plenty of sleep
rules were also laid down for the measurement of food adapting it rationally to the physiological needs of the child life
yet with all this science made no contribution that was entirely new
mothers had always nursed their children children had always been clothed they had breathed and eaten before
the point is that the same physical acts which performed blindly and without order led to disease and death when ordered were the means of giving strength and life
the great progress made may perhaps deceive us into thinking that everything possible has been done for children
we have only to weigh the matter carefully however to reflect are our children only those healthy little bodies which are growing and developing so vigorously under our eyes
is their destiny fulfilled in the production of beautiful human bodies
in that case there would be little difference between their lot and that of the animals which we raise that we may have good meat or beasts of burden
man destiny is evidently other than this and the care due to the child covers a field wider than that which is considered by physical hygiene
the mother who has given her child his bath and sent him in his perambulator to the park has not fulfilled the mission of the mother of humanity
the hen which gathers her chickens together and the cat which licks her kittens and lavishes on them such tender care differ in no wise from the human mother in the services they render
no the human mother if reduced to such limits devotes herself in vain feels that a higher aspiration has been stifled within her
children must grow not only in the body but in the spirit and the mother longs to follow the mysterious spiritual journey of the beloved one who will be the intelligent divine creation man
science evidently has not finished its progress
on the contrary it has scarcely taken the first step in advance for it has hitherto stopped at the welfare of the body
it must continue however to advance on the same positive lines along which it has improved the health and saved the physical life of the children it is bound in the future to benefit and to reenforce their inner life which is the real
on the same positive lines science will proceed to direct the development of the intelligence of character and of those latent creative forces which lie hidden in the marvelous embryo of man spirit
as the child body must draw nourishment and oxygen from its external environment in order to accomplish a great physiological work the of so also the spirit must take from its environment the nourishment which it needs to develop according to its own laws of growth
it can not be denied that the phenomena of development are a great work in themselves
the consolidation of the bones the growth of the whole body the completion of the minute construction of the brain the formation of the teeth all these are very real labors of the physiological organism as is also the transformation which the organism undergoes during the period of puberty
these exertions are very different from those put forth by mankind in that is to say in social production whether in the schools where man is taught or in the world where by the activity of his intelligence he produces wealth and transforms his environment
it is none the less true however that they are both work
in fact the organism during these periods of greatest physiological work is least capable of performing external tasks and sometimes the work of growth is of such extent and difficulty that the individual is overburdened as with an excessive strain and for this reason alone becomes exhausted or even dies
man will always be able to avoid external work by making use of the labor of others but there is no possibility of shirking that inner work
together with birth and death it has been imposed by nature itself and each man must accomplish it for himself
this difficult inevitable labor this is the work of the child
when we say then that little children should we are referring to one side only of the question of work
we mean that they should rest from that
visible work to which the little child through his weakness and incapacity can not make any contribution useful either to himself or to others
our assertion therefore is not absolute the child in reality is not resting he is performing the mysterious inner work of his autoformation
he is working to make a man and to accomplish this it is not enough that the child body should grow in actual size the most intimate functions of the motor and nervous systems must also be established and the intelligence developed
the functions to be established by the child fall into two groups  the motor functions by which he is to secure his balance and learn to walk and to coordinate his movements  the sensory functions through which receiving sensations from his environment he lays the foundations of his intelligence by a continual exercise of observation comparison and judgment
in this way he gradually comes to be acquainted with his environment and to develop his intelligence
at the same time he is learning a and he is faced not only with the motor difficulties of articulation sounds and words but also with the difficulty of gaining an intelligent understanding of names and of the syntactical composition of the language
if we think of an emigrant who goes to a new country ignorant of its products ignorant of its natural appearance and social order entirely ignorant of its language we realize that there is an immense work of adaptation which he must perform before he can associate himself with the active life of the unknown people
no one will be able to do for him that work of adaptation
he himself must observe understand remember form judgments and learn the new language by laborious exercise and long experience
what is to be said then of the child
what of this emigrant who comes into a new world who weak as he is and before his organism is completely developed in a short time adapt himself to a world so complex
up to the present day the little child has not received rational aid in the accomplishment of this laborious task
as regards the psychical development of the child we find ourselves in a period parallel to that in which the physical life was left to the mercy of chance and instinct the period in which infant mortality was a scourge
it is by scientific and rational means also that we must facilitate that inner work of psychical adaptation to be accomplished within the child a work which is by no means the same thing as any external work or production whatsoever
this is the aim which underlies my method of infant education and it is for this reason that certain principles which it enunciates together with that part which deals with the technique of their practical application are not of a general character but have special reference to the particular case of the child from three to seven years of age to the needs of a formative period of life
my method is scientific both in its substance and in its aim
it makes for the attainment of a more advanced stage of progress in directions no longer only material and physiological
it is an endeavor to complete the course which hygiene has already taken but in the treatment of the physical side alone
if we possessed statistics respecting the nervous debility defects of speech errors of perception and of reasoning and lack of character in normal children it would perhaps be interesting to compare them with statistics of the same nature but compiled from the study of children who have had a number of years of rational education
in all probability we should find a striking resemblance between such statistics and those available showing the decrease in mortality and the improvement in the physical development of children
a children house the children house is the which is offered to the child that he may be given the opportunity of developing his activities
this kind of school is not of a fixed type but may vary according to the financial resources at disposal and to the opportunities afforded by the environment
it ought to be a real house that is to say a set of rooms with a garden of which the children are the masters
a garden which contains shelters is ideal because the children can play or sleep under them and can also bring their tables out to work or dine
in this way they may live almost entirely in the open air and are protected at the same time from rain and sun
the central and principal room of the building often also the only room at the disposal of the children is the room for intellectual work
to this central room can be added other smaller rooms according to the means and opportunities of the place for example a bathroom a a little parlor or a room for manual work a gymnasium and
the special characteristic of the equipment of these houses is that it is adapted for children and not adults
they contain not only didactic material specially fitted for the intellectual development of the child but also a complete equipment for the management of the miniature family
the furniture is light so that the children can move it about and it is painted in some light color so that the children can wash it with soap and water
there are low tables of various sizes and shapes square rectangular and round large and small
the rectangular shape is the most common as two or more children can work at it together
the seats are small wooden chairs but there are also small wicker armchairs and sofas
in the there are two indispensable pieces of furniture
one of these is a very long cupboard with large doors
it is very low so that a small child can set on the top of it small objects such as mats flowers etc
inside this cupboard is kept the didactic material which is the common property of all the children
the other is a chest of drawers containing two or three columns of little drawers each of which has a bright handle or a handle of some color to contrast with the background and a small card with a name upon it
every child has his own drawer in which to put things belonging to him
round the walls of the room are fixed blackboards at a low level so that the children can write or draw on them and pleasing artistic pictures which are changed from time to time as circumstances direct
the pictures represent children families landscapes flowers and fruit and more often biblical and historical incidents
ornamental plants and flowering plants ought always to be placed in the room where the children are at work
another part of the equipment is seen in the pieces of carpet of various colors red blue pink green and brown
the children spread these rugs upon the floor sit upon them and work there with the didactic material
a room of this kind is larger than the customary not only because the little tables and separate chairs take up more space but also because a large part of the floor must be free for the children to spread their rugs and work upon them
in the or a kind of parlor in which the children amuse themselves by conversation games or music the furnishings should be especially tasteful
little tables of different sizes little armchairs and sofas should be placed here and there
many brackets of all kinds and sizes upon which may be put statuettes artistic vases or framed photographs should adorn the walls and above all each child should have a little in which he may sow the seed of some indoor plant to tend and cultivate it as it grows
on the tables of this should be placed large albums of colored pictures and also games of patience or various geometric solids with which the children can play at pleasure constructing figures etc
a piano or better other musical instruments possibly harps of small dimensions made especially for children completes the equipment
in this the teacher may sometimes entertain the children with stories which will attract a circle of interested listeners
the furniture of the consists in addition to the tables of low cupboards accessible to all the children who can themselves put in their place and take away the crockery spoons knives and forks and napkins
the plates are always of china and the tumblers and of glass
knives are always included in the table equipment
here each child has his own little cupboard or shelf
in the middle of the room there are very simple washstands consisting of tables on each of which stand a small basin soap and
against the wall stand little sinks with
here the children may draw and pour away their water
there is no limit to the equipment of the children houses because the children themselves do everything
they sweep the rooms dust and wash the furniture polish the brasses lay and clear away the table wash up sweep and roll up the rugs wash a few little clothes and cook eggs
as regards their personal toilet the children know how to dress and undress themselves
they hang their clothes on little hooks placed very low so as to be within reach of a little child or else they fold up such articles of clothing as their little of which they take great care and lay them inside a cupboard kept for the household linen
in short where the manufacture of toys has been brought to such a point of complication and perfection that children have at their disposal entire dolls ' houses complete wardrobes for the dressing and undressing of dolls kitchens where they can pretend to cook toy animals as nearly lifelike as possible this method seeks to give all this to the child in reality making him an actor in a living scene
illustration fig the montessori paedometer
my pedometer forms part of the equipment of a children house
after various modifications i have now reduced this instrument to a very practical form
the purpose of the pedometer as its name shows is to measure the children
it consists of a wide rectangular board forming the base from the center of which rise two wooden posts held together at the top by a narrow flat piece of metal
to each post is connected a horizontal metal rod the indicator which runs up and down by means of a casing also of metal
this metal casing is made in one piece with the indicator to the end of which is fixed an ball
on one side that is to say behind one of the two tall vertical wooden posts there is a small seat also of wood
the two tall wooden posts are graduated
the post to which the seat is fixed is graduated from the surface of the seat to the top whilst the other is graduated from the wooden board at the base to the top to a height of meters
on the side containing the seat the height of the child seated is measured on the other side the child full stature
the practical value of this instrument lies in the possibility of measuring two children at the same time and in the fact that the children themselves cooperate in taking the measurements
in fact they learn to take off their shoes and to place themselves in the correct position on the pedometer
they find no difficulty in raising and lowering the metal indicators which are held so firmly in place by means of the metal casing that they can not deviate from their horizontal position even when used by inexpert hands
moreover they run extremely easily so that very little strength is required to move them
the little balls prevent the children from hurting themselves should they inadvertently knock their heads against the metal indicator
the children are very fond of the pedometer
shall we measure ourselves is one of the proposals which they make most willingly and with the greatest likelihood of finding many of their companions to join them
they also take great care of the pedometer dusting it and polishing its metal parts
all the surfaces of the pedometer are so smooth and well polished that they invite the care that is taken of them and by their appearance when finished fully repay the trouble taken
the pedometer represents the scientific part of the method because it has reference to the anthropological and psychological study made of the children each of whom has his own biographical record
this biographical record follows the history of the child development according to the observations which it is possible to make by the application of my method
this subject is dealt with at length in my other books
a series of cinematograph pictures has been taken of the pedometer at a moment when the children are being measured
they are seen coming of their own accord even the very smallest to take their places at the instrument
the method the technique of my method as it follows the guidance of the natural physiological and psychical development of the child may be divided into three parts motor education
the care and management of the environment itself afford the principal means of motor education while sensory education and the education of language are provided for by my didactic material
the didactic material for the of the consists of
three sets of solids in graduated sizes comprising  pink cubes
colored green colored alternately red and blue
various geometric solids prism pyramid sphere cylinder cone etc
rectangular tablets with rough and smooth surfaces
small wooden tablets of different weights
two boxes each containing colored tablets
a chest of drawers containing plane insets
three series of cards on which are pasted geometrical forms in paper
a collection of cylindrical closed boxes sounds
a double series of musical bells wooden boards on which are painted the lines used in music small wooden discs for the notes
material for the preparation for writing and
two sloping desks and various iron insets
cards on which are pasted sandpaper letters
two alphabets of colored cardboard and of different sizes
a series of cards on which are pasted sandpaper figures    etc
a series of large cards bearing the same figures in smooth paper for the enumeration of numbers above ten
two boxes with small sticks for counting
the volume of drawings belonging specially to the method and colored pencils
the frames for lacing buttoning which are used for the education of the movements of the hand
the education of the movements is very complex as it must correspond to all the coordinated movements which the child has to establish in his physiological organism
the child if left without guidance is disorderly in his movements and these disorderly movements are the characteristic of the little
in fact he never keeps still and touches everything
this is what forms the child unruliness and naughtiness
the adult would deal with him by checking these movements with the monotonous and useless repetition keep still
as a matter of fact in these movements the little one is seeking the very exercise which will organize and coordinate the movements useful to man
we must therefore desist from the useless attempt to reduce the child to a state of immobility
we should rather give order to his movements leading them to those actions towards which his efforts are actually tending
this is the aim of muscular education at this age
once a direction is given to them the child movements are made towards a definite end so that he himself grows quiet and contented and becomes an active worker a being calm and full of joy
this education of the movements is one of the principal factors in producing that outward appearance of discipline to be found in the children houses
i have already spoken at length on this subject in my other books
muscular education has reference to the primary movements of everyday life walking rising sitting handling objects
frames for lacing and buttoning
in the care of the person the first step is that of dressing and undressing
for this end there is in my didactic material a collection of frames to which are attached pieces of stuff leather etc
these can be buttoned hooked tied together in fact joined in all the different ways which our civilization has invented for fastening our clothing shoes etc fig
the teacher sitting by the child side performs the necessary movements of the fingers very slowly and deliberately separating the movements themselves into their different parts and letting them be seen clearly and minutely
for example one of the first actions will be the adjustment of the two pieces of stuff in such a way that the edges to be fastened together touch one another from top to bottom
then if it is a the teacher will show the child the different stages of the action
she will take hold of the button set it opposite the buttonhole make it enter the buttonhole completely and adjust it carefully in its place above
in the same way to teach a child to tie a bow she will separate the stage in which he ties the ribbons together from that in which he makes the bows
in the cinematograph film there is a picture which shows an entire lesson in the tying of the bows with the ribbons
these lessons are not necessary for all the children as they learn from one another and of their own accord come with great patience to analyze the movements performing them separately very slowly and carefully
the child can sit in a comfortable position and hold his frame on the table
as he fastens and unfastens the same frame many times over with great interest he acquires an unusual deftness of hand and becomes possessed with the desire to fasten real clothes whenever he has the opportunity
we see the smallest children to dress themselves and their companions
they go in search of amusement of this kind and defend themselves with all their might against the adult who would try to help them
in the same way for the teaching of the other and larger movements such as washing setting the table the directress must at the beginning intervene teaching the child with few or no words at all but with very precise actions
she teaches all the movements how to sit to rise from one seat to take up and lay down objects and to offer them gracefully to others
in the same way she teaches the children to set the plates one upon the other and lay them on the table without making any noise
the children learn easily and show an interest and surprising care in the performance of these actions
in classes where there are many children it is necessary to arrange for the children to take turns in the various household duties such as housework serving at table and washing dishes
the children readily respect such a system of turns
there is no need to ask them to do this work for they come spontaneously even little ones of two and a half years old to offer to do their share and it is frequently most touching to watch their efforts to imitate to remember and finally to conquer their difficulty
professor jacoby of new york was once much moved as he watched a child who was little more than two years old and not at all intelligent in appearance standing perplexed because he could not remember whether the fork should be set at the right hand or the left
he remained a long while meditating and evidently using all the powers of his mind
the other children older than he watched him with admiration marveling like ourselves at the life developing under our eyes
the instructions of the teacher consist then merely in a hint a touch enough to give a start to the child
the children learn from one another and throw themselves into the work with enthusiasm and delight
this atmosphere of quiet activity develops a an attitude of mutual aid and most wonderful of all an intelligent interest on the part of the older children in the progress of their little companions
it is enough just to set a child in these peaceful surroundings for him to feel perfectly at home
in the cinematograph pictures the actual work in a children house may be seen
the children are moving about each one fulfilling his own task whilst the teacher is in a corner watching
pictures were taken also of the children engaged in the care of the house that is in the care both of their persons and of their surroundings
they can be seen washing their faces polishing their shoes washing the furniture polishing the metal indicators of the pedometer brushing the carpets etc
in the work of laying the table the children are seen quite by themselves dividing the work among themselves carrying the plates spoons knives and forks and finally sitting down at the tables where the little waitresses serve the hot soup
again gardening and manual work are a great pleasure to our children
gardening is already well known as a feature of infant education and it is recognized by all that plants and animals attract the children care and attention
the ideal of the children houses in this respect is to imitate the best in the present usage of those schools which owe their inspiration more or less to mrs latter
for manual instruction we have chosen clay work consisting of the construction of little tiles vases and bricks
these may be made with the help of simple instruments such as molds
the completion of the work should be the aim always kept in view and finally all the little objects made by the children should be glazed and baked in the furnace
the children themselves learn to line a wall with shining white or colored tiles wrought in various designs or with the help of mortar and a trowel to cover the floor with little bricks
they also dig out foundations and then use their bricks to build division walls or entire little houses for the chickens
among the gymnastic exercises that which must be considered the most important is that of the line
a line is described in chalk or paint upon a large space of floor
instead of one line there may also be two concentric lines elliptical in form
the children are taught to walk upon these lines like walkers placing their feet one in front of the other
to keep their balance they make efforts exactly similar to those of real walkers except that they have no danger with which to reckon as the lines are only upon the floor
the teacher herself performs the exercise showing clearly how she sets her feet and the children imitate her without any necessity for her to speak
at first it is only certain children who follow her and when she has shown them how to do it she withdraws leaving the phenomenon to develop of itself
the children for the most part continue to walk adapting their feet with great care to the movement they have seen and making efforts to keep their balance so as not to fall
gradually the other children draw near and watch and also make an attempt
very little time elapses before the whole of the two ellipses or the one line is covered with children balancing themselves and continuing to walk round watching their feet with an expression of deep attention on their faces
it should be a very simple march the rhythm of which is not obvious at first but which accompanies and enlivens the spontaneous efforts of the children
when they have learned in this way to master their balance the children have brought the act of walking to a remarkable standard of perfection and have acquired in addition to security and composure in their natural gait an unusually graceful carriage of the body
the exercise on the line can afterwards be made more complicated in various ways
the first application is that of calling forth rhythmic exercise by the sound of a march upon the piano
when the same march is repeated during several days the children end by feeling the rhythm and by following it with movements of their arms and feet
they also accompany the exercises on the line with songs
little by little the music is by the children
they finish as in miss george school at washington by singing over their daily work with the didactic material
the children house then resembles a hive of bees humming as they work
as to the little gymnasium of which i speak in my book on the method one piece of apparatus is particularly practical
this is the fence from which the children hang by their arms freeing their legs from the heavy weight of the body and strengthening the arms
this fence has also the advantage of being useful in a garden for the purpose of dividing one part from another as for example the from the garden walks and it does not detract in any way from the appearance of the garden
my didactic material offers to the child the for what may be called sensory education
in the box of material the first three objects which are likely to attract the attention of a little child from two and a half to three years old are three solid pieces of wood in each of which is inserted a row of ten small cylinders or sometimes discs all furnished with a button for a handle
in the first case there is a row of cylinders of the same height but with a diameter which decreases from thick to thin
in the second there are cylinders which decrease in all dimensions and so are either larger or smaller but always of the same shape
lastly in the third case the cylinders have the same diameter but vary in height so that as the size decreases the cylinder gradually becomes a little disc in form
the first cylinders vary in two dimensions the section the second in all three dimensions the third in one dimension height
the order which i have given refers to the degree of with which the child performs the exercises
the exercise consists in taking out the cylinders mixing them and putting them back in the right place
it is performed by the child as he sits in a comfortable position at a little table
he exercises his hands in the delicate act of taking hold of the button with the tips of one or two fingers and in the little movements of the hand and arm as he mixes the cylinders letting them and making too much and puts them back again each in its own place
in these exercises the teacher may in the first instance intervene merely taking out the cylinders mixing them carefully on the table and then showing the child that he is to put them back but without performing the action herself
such intervention however is almost always found to be unnecessary for the children
their companions at work and thus are encouraged to imitate them
they like to do it in fact sometimes almost in private for fear of inopportune help
but how is the child to find the right place for each of the little cylinders which lie mixed upon the table
he first makes trials it often happens that he places a cylinder which is too large for the empty hole over which he puts it
then changing its place he tries others until the cylinder goes in
again the contrary may happen that is to say the cylinder may slip too easily into a hole too big for it
in that case it has taken a place which does not belong to it at all but to a larger cylinder
in this way one cylinder at the end will be left out without a place and it will not be possible to find one that fits
here the child can not help seeing his mistake in concrete form
he is perplexed his little mind is faced with a problem which interests him intensely
before all the cylinders fitted now there is one that will not fit
the little one stops frowning deep in thought
he begins to feel the little buttons and finds that some cylinders have too much room
he thinks that perhaps they are out of their right place and tries to place them correctly
he repeats the process again and again and finally he succeeds
then it is that he breaks into a smile of triumph
the exercise arouses the intelligence of the child he wants to repeat it right from the beginning and having learned by experience he makes another attempt
little children from three to three and a half years old have repeated the exercise up to times without losing their interest in it
if the second set of cylinders and then the third are presented the of shape strikes the child and reawakens his interest
the material which i have described serves to the to distinguish in for the child ends by being able to recognize at a glance the larger or the smaller hole which exactly fits the cylinder which he holds in his hand
the educative process is based on this that the control of the error lies in material and the child has concrete evidence of it
the desire of the child to attain an end which he knows leads him to correct himself
it is not a teacher who makes him notice his mistake and shows him how to correct it but it is a complex work of the child own intelligence which leads to such a result
hence at this point there begins the process of
the aim is not an external one that is to say it is
the object that the child should learn how to place the cylinders and he should know how to perform an
the aim is an inner one namely that the child train himself to observe that he be led to make comparisons between objects to form judgments to reason and to decide and it is in the indefinite repetition of this exercise of attention and of intelligence that a real development ensues
the series of objects to follow after the cylinders consists of three sets of geometrical solid forms  ten wooden cubes colored pink
the sides of the cubes diminish from ten centimeters to one centimeter
with these cubes the child builds a tower first laying on the ground upon a carpet the largest cube and then placing on the top of it all the others in their order of size to the very smallest
as soon as he has built the tower the child with a blow of his hand knocks it down so that the cubes are scattered on the carpet and then he builds it up again
ten wooden prisms colored brown
the length of the prisms is twenty centimeters and the square section diminishes from ten centimeters a side to the smallest one centimeter a side
the child scatters the ten pieces over a carpet and then beginning sometimes with the thickest sometimes with the thinnest he places them in their right order of gradation upon a table
ten rods colored green or alternately red and blue all of which have the same square section of four centimeters a side but vary by ten centimeters in length from ten centimeters to one meter
the child scatters the ten rods on a large carpet and mixes them at random and by comparing rod with rod he arranges them according to their order of length so that they take the form of a set of organ pipes
as usual the teacher by doing the exercises herself first shows the child how the pieces of each set should be arranged but it will often happen that the child learns not directly from her but by watching his companions
she will however always continue to watch the children never losing sight of their efforts and any correction of hers will be directed more towards preventing rough or disorderly use of the material than towards any which the child may make in placing the rods in their order of gradation
the reason is that the mistakes which the child makes by placing for example a small cube beneath one that is larger are caused by his own lack of education and it is the of the which by refining his powers of observation will lead him sooner or later to
sometimes it happens that a child working with the long rods makes the most glaring mistakes
as the aim of the exercise however is that the rods be arranged in the right order of gradation but that the child practise by there is no need to intervene
one day the child will arrange all the rods in their right order and then full of joy he will call the teacher to come and admire them
the object of the exercise will thus be achieved
these three sets the cubes the prisms and the rods cause the child to move about and to handle and carry objects which are difficult for him to grasp with his little hand
again by their use he repeats the of the to the recognition of differences of size between similar objects
the exercise would seem easier from the sensory point of view than the other with the cylinders described above
as a matter of fact it is more difficult as there is control of the error in the material
it is the child eye alone which can furnish the control
hence the difference between the objects should strike the eye at once for that reason larger objects are used and the necessary visual power presupposes a previous preparation provided for in the exercise with the solid insets
during the same period the child can be doing other exercises
among the material is to be found a small rectangular board the surface of which is divided into two parts rough and smooth
the child knows already how to wash his hands with cold water and soap he then dries them and dips the tips of his fingers for a few seconds in tepid water
graduated exercises for the thermic sense may also have their place here as has been explained in my book on the method
after this the child is taught to pass the soft cushioned tips of his fingers lightly as over the two separate surfaces that he may appreciate their difference
the delicate backwards and forwards of the suspended hand as it is brought into light contact with the surface is an excellent exercise in control
the little hand which has just been cleansed and given its tepid bath gains much in grace and beauty and the whole exercise is the first step in the education of the tactile sense which holds such an important place in my method
when initiating the child into the education of the sense of touch the teacher must always take an active part the first time not only must she show the child how it is done her interference is a little more definite still for she takes hold of his hand and guides it to touch the surfaces with the in the lightest possible way
she will make no explanations her words will be rather to
the child with his hand to perceive the different sensations
when he has perceived them it is then that he repeats the act by himself in the delicate way which he has been taught
after the board with the two contrasting surfaces the child is offered another board on which are gummed strips of paper which are rough or smooth in different degrees
fig  graduated series of sandpaper cards are also given
the child perfects himself by exercises in touching these surfaces not only refining his capacity for perceiving tactile differences which are always growing more similar but also perfecting the movement of which he is ever gaining greater mastery
following these is a series of stuffs of every kind velvets satins silks woolens cottons coarse and fine linens
there are two similar pieces of each kind of stuff and they are of bright and vivid colors
the child is now taught a new movement
where before he had to he must now
the stuffs which according to the degree of fineness or coarseness from coarse cotton to fine silk are felt with movements correspondingly decisive or delicate
the child whose hand is already practised finds the greatest pleasure in feeling the stuffs and almost instinctively in order to enhance his appreciation of the tactile sensation he closes his eyes
then to spare himself the exertion he blindfolds himself with a clean handkerchief and as he feels the stuffs he arranges the similar pieces in pairs one upon the other then taking off the handkerchief he ascertains for himself whether he has made any mistake
this exercise in and is peculiarly attractive to the child and induces him to seek similar experiences in his surroundings
a little one attracted by the pretty stuff of a visitor dress will be seen to go and wash his hands then to come and touch the stuff of the garment again and again with infinite delicacy his face meanwhile expressing his pleasure and interest
a little later we shall see the children interest themselves in a much more difficult exercise
wood tablets differing in weight
there are some little rectangular tablets which form part of the material
the tablets though of identical size are made of wood of varying qualities so that they differ in weight and through the property of the wood in color also
the child has to take a tablet and rest it delicately on the inner surfaces of his four fingers spreading them well out
this will be another opportunity of teaching delicate movements
the hand must move up and down as though to weigh the object but the movement must be as imperceptible as possible
these little movements should diminish as the capacity and attention for perceiving the weight of the object becomes more acute and the exercise will be perfectly performed when the child comes to perceive the weight almost without any movement of the hands
it is only by the repetition of the attempts that such a result can be obtained
once the children are initiated into it by the teacher they blindfold their eyes and repeat by themselves these exercises of the
for example they lay the heavier wooden tablets on the right and the lighter on the left
when the child takes off the handkerchief he can see by the color of the pieces of wood if he has made a mistake
a long time before this difficult exercise and during the period when the child is working with the three sorts of geometrical solids and with the rough and smooth tablets he can be exercising himself with a material which is very attractive to him
this is the set of tablets covered with bright silk of shaded colors
the set consists of two separate boxes each containing colors that is eight different tints each of which has eight shades carefully graded
the first exercise for the child is that of the that is he selects from a mixed heap of colors the two tablets which are alike and lays them out one beside the other
the teacher naturally does not offer the child all the one hundred and tablets in a heap but chooses only a few of the brighter colors for example red blue and yellow and prepares and mixes up three or four pairs
then taking one tablet perhaps the red one she indicates to the child that he is to choose its counterpart from the heap
this done the teacher lays the pair together on the table
then she takes perhaps the blue and the child selects the tablet to form another pair
the teacher then mixes the tablets again for the child to repeat the exercise by himself to select the two red tablets the two blue the two yellow and to place the two members of each pair next to one another
then the couples will be increased to four or five and little children of three years old end by pairing of their own accord ten or a dozen couples of mixed tablets
when the child has given his eye sufficient practise in recognizing the identity of the pairs of colors he is offered the shades of one color only and he exercises himself in the perception of the slightest differences of shade in every color
take for example the blue series
there are eight tablets in graduated shades
the teacher places them one beside another beginning with the darkest with the sole object of making the child understand what is to be done
she then leaves him alone to the interesting attempts which he spontaneously makes
it often happens that the child makes a mistake
if he has understood the idea and makes a mistake it is a sign that
he has not yet reached the of perceiving the differences between the graduations of one color
it is practise which perfects in the child that capacity for distinguishing the fine differences and so we leave him alone to his attempts
there are two suggestions that we can make to help him
the first is that he should always select the darkest color from the pile
this suggestion greatly facilitates his choice by giving it a constant direction
secondly we can lead him to observe from time to time any two colors that stand next to each other in order to compare them directly and apart from the others
in this way the child does not place a tablet without a particular and careful comparison with its neighbor
finally the child himself will love to mix the colors and then to arrange them in eight rows of pretty shades of color with really surprising skill
in this exercise also the child hand is educated to perform fine and delicate movements and his mind is afforded special training in attention
he must not take hold of the tablets anyhow he must avoid touching the colored silk and must handle the tablets instead by the pieces of wood at the top and bottom
to arrange the tablets next to one another in a straight line at exactly the same level so that the series looks like a beautiful shaded ribbon is an act which demands a manual skill only obtained after considerable practise
these exercises of the chromatic sense lead in the case of the older children to the development of the color memory
a child having looked carefully at a color is then invited to look for its companion in a mixed group of colors without of course keeping the color he has observed under his eye to guide him
it is therefore by his memory that he recognizes the color which he no longer compares with a reality but with an image impressed upon his mind
the children are very fond of this exercise in color memory it makes a lively digression for them as they run with the image of a color in their minds and look for its corresponding reality in their surroundings
it is a real triumph for them to identify the idea with the corresponding reality and to in their
the proof of the mental power they have acquired
another interesting piece of material is a little cabinet containing six drawers placed one above another
when they are opened they display six square wooden frames in each
almost all the frames have a large geometrical figure inserted in the center each colored blue and provided with a small button for a handle
each drawer is lined with blue paper and when the geometrical figure is removed the bottom is seen to reproduce exactly the same form
the geometrical figures are arranged in the drawers according to analogy of form
in one drawer there are six circles decreasing in diameter
in another there is a square together with five rectangles in which the length is always equal to the side of the square while the breadth gradually decreases
another drawer contains six triangles which vary either according to their sides or according to their angles the equilateral isosceles scalene right angled obtuse angled and acute angled
in another drawer there are six regular polygons containing from five to ten sides the pentagon hexagon heptagon octagon nonagon and decagon
another drawer contains various figures an oval an ellipse a rhombus and a trapezoid
finally there are four plain wooden tablets without any geometrical inset which should have no button fixed to them also two other irregular geometrical figures
connected with this material there is a wooden frame furnished with a kind of rack which opens like a lid and serves when shut to keep firmly in place six of the insets which may be arranged on the bottom of the frame itself entirely covering it
this frame is used for the preparation of the to the child of the plane geometrical forms
the teacher may select according to her own judgment certain forms from among the whole series at her disposal
at first it is advisable to show the child only a few figures which differ very widely from one another in form
the next step is to present a larger number of figures and after this to present consecutively figures more and more similar in form
the first figures to be arranged in the frame will be for example the circle and the equilateral triangle or the circle the triangle and the square
the spaces which are left should be covered with the tablets of plain wood
gradually the frame is completely filled with figures first with very dissimilar figures as for example a square a very narrow rectangle a triangle a circle an ellipse and a hexagon or with other figures in combination
afterwards the teacher object will be to arrange figures similar to one another in the frame as for example the set of six rectangles six triangles six circles varying in size etc
this exercise resembles that of the cylinders
the insets are held by the buttons and taken from their places
they are then mixed on the table and the child is invited to put them back in their places
here also the control of the error is in the for the figure can not be inserted perfectly except when it is put in its own place
hence a series of experiments of attempts which end in victory
the child is led to compare the various forms to realize in a concrete way the differences between them when an inset wrongly placed will not go into the aperture
in this way he educates his eye to the of
the new movement of the hand which the child must coordinate is of particular importance
he is taught to the outline of the geometrical
with the soft tips of the index and middle finger of the right hand or of the left as well if one believes in ambidexterity
the child is made to touch the outline not only of the but also of the corresponding aperture and only after them is he to put back the inset into its place
the of the form is rendered much easier in this way
children who evidently do not the identities of by the eye and who make absurd attempts to place the most diverse figures one within the other
the forms after having touched their outlines and arrange them very quickly in their right places
the child hand during this exercise of touching the outlines of the geometrical figures has a concrete guide in the object
this is especially true when he touches the frames for his two fingers have only to follow the edge of the frame which acts as an obstacle and is a very clear guide
the teacher must always intervene at the start to teach accurately this movement which will have such an importance in the future
she must therefore show the child
how to not only by performing the movement herself slowly and clearly but also by guiding the child hand itself during his first attempts so that he is sure to touch all the details angles and sides
when his hand has learned to perform these movements with precision and accuracy he will be capable of following the outline of a geometrical figure and through many repetitions of the exercise he will come to coordinate the movement for the exact delineation of its form
this exercise could be called an indirect but very real preparation for drawing
it is certainly the preparation of the hand to an enclosed
the little hand which touches feels and knows how to follow a determined outline is preparing itself without knowing it for writing
the children make a special point of touching the outlines of the plane insets with accuracy
they themselves have invented the exercise of blindfolding their eyes so as to recognize the forms by touch only taking out and putting back the insets without seeing them
series of cards with geometrical forms
corresponding to every form reproduced in the plane insets there are three white cards square in shape and of exactly the same size as the wooden frames of the insets
these cards are kept in three special cardboard boxes almost cubic in form
on the cards are repeated in three series the same geometrical forms as those of the plane insets
the same measurements of the figures also are exactly reproduced
in the first series the forms are filled in they are cut out in blue paper and gummed on to the card in the second series there is only an outline about half a centimeter in width which is cut out in the same blue paper and gummed to the card in the third series however the geometrical figures are instead outlined only in black ink
by the use of this second piece of the material the exercise of the eye is gradually brought to perfection in the recognition of plane forms
in fact there is no longer the concrete control of error in the material as there was in the insets but the child by his eye alone must judge of identities of form when instead of
the wooden forms into their corresponding apertures he simply
again the refinement of the eye power of discrimination increases every time the child passes from one series of cards to the next and by the time that he has reached the third series he can see the relation between a wooden object which he holds in his hand and an outline drawing that is he can connect the concrete reality with an
the now assumes in his eyes a very definite meaning and he accustoms himself to recognize to interpret and to judge of forms contained by a simple outline
the exercises are various the children themselves invent them
some love to spread out a number of the figures of the geometric insets before their eyes and then taking a handful of the cards and mixing them like playing cards deal them out as quickly as possible choosing the figures corresponding to the pieces
then as a test of their choice they place the wooden pieces upon the forms on the cards
at this exercise they often cover whole tables putting the wooden figures above and beneath each one in a vertical line the three corresponding forms of the cardboard series
another game invented by the children consists in putting out and mixing all the cards of the three series on two or three adjoining tables
the child then takes a wooden geometrical form and places it as quickly as possible on the corresponding cards which he has recognized at a glance among all the rest
four or five children play this game together and as soon as one of them has found for example the figure corresponding to the wooden piece and has placed the piece carefully and precisely upon it another child takes away the piece in order to place it on the same form in outline
the game is somewhat suggestive of chess
many children without any suggestion from any one touch with the finger the outline of the figures in the three series of cards doing it with seriousness of purpose interest and perseverance
we teach the children to name all the forms of the plane insets
at first i had intended to limit my teaching to the most important names such as square rectangle circle
but the children wanted to know all the names taking pleasure in learning even the most difficult such as trapezium and decagon
they also show great pleasure in listening to the exact pronunciation of new words and in their repetition
early childhood is in fact the age in which language is formed and in which the sounds of a foreign language can be perfectly learned
when the child has had long practise with the plane insets he begins to make discoveries in his environment recognizing forms colors and qualities already known to him a result which in general follows after all the sensory exercises
then it is that a great enthusiasm is aroused in him and the world becomes for him a source of pleasure
a little boy walking one day alone on the roof terrace repeated to himself with a thoughtful expression on his face the sky is blue
once a cardinal an admirer of the children of the school in via guisti wished himself to bring them some biscuits and to enjoy the sight of a little greediness among the children
when he had finished his distribution instead of seeing the children put the food hastily into their mouths to his great surprise he heard them call out a triangle
in fact these biscuits were made in geometrical shapes
in one of the people dwellings at milan a mother preparing the dinner in the kitchen took from a packet a slice of bread and butter
her little boy who was with her said rectangle
the woman going on with her work cut off a large corner of the slice of bread and the child cried out triangle
she put this bit into the saucepan and the child looking at the piece that was left called out more loudly than before and now it is a trapezium
the father a working man who was present was much impressed with the incident
he went straight to look for the teacher and asked for an explanation
much moved he said if i had been educated in that way i should not be now just an ordinary workman
it was he who later on arranged for a demonstration to induce all the workmen of the dwellings to take an interest in the school
they ended by presenting the teacher with a parchment they had painted themselves and on it between the pictures of little children they had introduced every kind of geometrical form
as regards the touching of objects for the realization of their form there is an infinite field of discovery open to the child in his environment
children have been seen to stand opposite a beautiful pillar or a statue and after having admired it to close their eyes in a state of beatitude and pass their hands many times over the forms
one of our teachers met one day in a church two little brothers from the school in via guisti
they were standing looking at the small columns supporting the altar
little by little the elder boy edged nearer the columns and began to touch them then as if he desired his little brother to share his pleasure he drew him nearer and taking his hand very gently made him pass it round the smooth and beautiful shape of the column
but a sacristan came up at that moment and sent away those tiresome children who were touching everything
the great pleasure which the children derive from the recognition of by touching their form corresponds in itself to a sensory exercise
many psychologists have spoken of the sense that is the capacity of recognizing forms by the movement of the muscles of the hand as it follows the outlines of solid objects
this sense does not consist only of the sense of touch because the tactile sensation is only that by which we perceive the differences in quality of surfaces rough or smooth
perception of form comes from the combination of two sensations tactile and muscular muscular sensations being sensations of movement
what we call in the blind the sense is in reality more often the stereognostic sense
that is they perceive by means of their hands the of
it is the special muscular sensibility of the child from three to six years of age who is forming his own muscular activity which stimulates him to use the stereognostic sense
when the child spontaneously blindfolds his eyes in order to recognize various objects such as the plane and solid insets he is exercising this sense
there are many exercises which he can do to enable him to recognize with closed eyes objects of well defined shapes as for example the little bricks and cubes of froebel marbles coins beans peas etc
from a selection of different objects mixed together he can pick out those that are alike and arrange them in separate heaps
in the didactic material there are also geometrical solids pale blue in color a sphere a prism a pyramid a cone a cylinder
the most attractive way of teaching a child to recognize these forms is for him to touch them with closed eyes and guess their names the latter learned in a way which i will describe later
after an exercise of this kind the child when his eyes are open observes the forms with a much more lively interest
another way of interesting him in the solid geometrical forms is to make them
the sphere rolls in every direction the cylinder rolls in one direction only the cone rolls round itself the prism and the pyramid however stand still but the prism falls over more easily than the pyramid
little more remains of the didactic material for the education of the senses
there is however a series of six cardboard cylinders either closed entirely or with wooden covers
when these cases are shaken they produce sounds varying in intensity from loud to almost imperceptible sounds according to the nature of the objects inside the cylinder
there is a double act of these and the exercise consists first in the recognition of sounds of equal intensity arranging the cylinders in pairs
the next exercise consists in the comparison of one sound with another that is the child arranges the six cylinders in a series according to the loudness of sound which they produce
the exercise is analogous to that with the color spools which also are paired and then arranged in gradation
in this case also the child performs the exercise seated comfortably at a table
after a preliminary explanation from the teacher he repeats the exercise by himself his eyes being blindfolded that he may better concentrate his attention
we may conclude with a general rule for the direction of the education of the senses
the order of procedure should be  recognition of
the pairing of similar objects and the insertion of solid forms into places which fit them
the presentation of the extremes of a series of objects
discrimination between objects very to one another
to concentrate the attention of the child upon the sensory stimulus which is acting upon him at a particular moment it is well as far as possible to
the sense for instance to obtain silence in the room for all the exercises and to blindfold the eyes for those particular exercises which do not relate to the education of the sense of sight
the cinematograph pictures give a general idea of all the sense exercises which the children can do with the material and any one who has been initiated into the theory on which these are based will be able gradually to recognize them as they are seen practically carried out
it is very advisable for those who wish to guide the children in these sensory exercises to begin themselves by working with the didactic material
the experience will give them some idea of what the children must feel of the difficulties which they must overcome and up to a certain point it will give them some conception of the interest which these exercises can arouse in them
whoever makes such experiments himself will be most struck by the fact that when blindfolded he finds that all the sensations of touch and hearing really appear more acute and more easily recognized
on account of this alone no small interest will be aroused in the experimenter
for the beginning of the education of the musical sense we use in rome a material which does not form part of the didactic apparatus as it is sold at present
it consists of a double series of bells forming an octave with tones and semitones
these metal bells which stand upon a wooden rectangular base are all alike in appearance but when struck with a little wooden hammer give out sounds corresponding to the notes doh re mi fah soh lah ti doh doh
illustration musical scale chromatic
one series of bells is arranged in chromatic order upon a long board upon which are painted rectangular spaces which are black and white and of the same size as the bases which support the bells
as on a pianoforte keyboard the white spaces correspond to the tones and the black to the semitones
at first the only bells to be arranged upon the board are those which correspond to the tones these are set upon the white spaces in the order of the musical notes doh re mi fah soh lah ti doh
to perform the first exercise the child strikes with a small hammer the first note of the series already arranged doh
then among a second series of corresponding bells which arranged without the semitones are mixed together upon the table he tries by striking the bells one after the other to find the sound which is the same as the first one he has struck doh
when he has succeeded in finding the corresponding sound he puts the bell thus chosen opposite the first one doh upon the board
then he strikes the second bell once or twice then from among the mixed group of bells he makes experiments until he recognizes which he places opposite the second bell of the series already arranged
he continues in the same way right to the end looking for the identity of the sounds and performing an exercise of similar to that already done in the case of the the colors etc
later he learns in order the sounds of the musical scale striking in rapid succession the bells arranged in order and also accompanying his action with his voice doh re mi fah soh lah ti doh
when he is able to recognize and
the series of sounds the child takes the eight bells and after mixing them up he tries by striking them with the hammer to find then etc
every time that he takes a new note he strikes from the beginning all the bells already recognized and arranged in order doh doh re doh re mi doh re mi fah etc
in this way he succeeds in arranging all the bells in the order of the scale guided only by his ear and having succeeded he strikes all the notes one after the other up and down the scale
this exercise fascinates children from five years old upwards
if the objects which have been described constitute the didactic material for the beginnings of a methodical education of the auditory sense i have no desire to limit to them an educational process which is so important and already so complex in its practise whether in the long established methods of treatment for the deaf or in modern physiological musical education
in fact i also use resonant metal tubes small bars of wood which emit musical notes and strings little harps upon which the children seek to recognize the tones they have already learned with the exercise of the bells
the pianoforte may also be used for the same purpose
in this way the difference in comes to be perceived together with the differences in tone
at the same time various exercises already mentioned such as the marches played on the piano for rhythmic exercises and the simple songs sung by the children themselves offer extensive means for the development of the musical sense
to quicken the child attention in special relation to sounds there is a most important exercise which contrary to all attempts made up to this time in the practise of education consists not in producing but in eliminating as far as possible all sounds from the environment
my lesson of silence has been very widely applied even in schools where the rest of my method has not found its way for the sake of its practical effect upon the discipline of the children
the children are taught not to move to inhibit all those motor impulses which may arise from any cause whatsoever and in order to induce in them real immobility it is necessary to initiate them in the of all their movements
the teacher then does not limit herself to saying sit still but she gives them the example herself showing them how to sit absolutely still that is with feet still body still arms still head still
the respiratory movements should also be performed in such a way as to produce no sound
the children must be taught how to succeed in this exercise
the fundamental condition is that of finding a comfortable position a position of equilibrium
as they are seated for this exercise they must therefore make themselves comfortable either in their little chairs or on the ground
when immobility is obtained the room is or else the children close their eyes or cover them with their hands
it is quite plain to see that the children take a great interest in the silence they seem to give themselves up to a kind of spell they might be said to be wrapped in meditation
little by little as each child watching himself becomes more and more still the silence deepens till it becomes absolute and can be felt just as the twilight gradually deepens whilst the sun is setting
then it is that slight sounds unnoticed before are heard the ticking of the clock the chirp of a sparrow in the garden the flight of a butterfly
the world becomes full of imperceptible sounds which invade that deep silence without disturbing it just as the stars shine out in the dark sky without banishing the darkness of the night
it is almost the discovery of a new world where there is rest
it is as it were the twilight of the world of loud noises and of the uproar that oppresses the spirit
at such a time the spirit is set free and opens out like the corolla of the convolvulus
and leaving metaphor for the reality of facts can we not all recall feelings that have possessed us at sunset when all the vivid impressions of the day the brightness and clamor are silenced
it is not that we miss the day but that our spirit expands
it becomes more sensitive to the inner play of emotions strong and persistent or changeful and serene
it was that hour when mariners feel longing and hearts grow tender
the lesson of silence ends with a general calling of the children names
the teacher or one of the children takes her place behind the class or in an adjoining room and calls the motionless children one by one by name the call is made in a whisper that is without vocal sound
this demands a close attention on the part of the child if he is to hear his name
when his name is called he must rise and find his way to the voice which called him his movements must be light and vigilant and so controlled to make no
when the children have become acquainted with their hearing is in a manner refined for the perception of sounds
those sounds which are too loud become gradually displeasing to the ear of one who has known the pleasure of silence and has discovered the world of delicate sounds
from this point the children gradually go on to perfect themselves they walk lightly take care not to knock against the furniture move their chairs without noise and place things upon the table with great care
the result of this is seen in the grace of carriage and of movement which is especially delightful on account of the way in which it has been brought about
it is not a grace taught externally for the sake of beauty or regard for the world but one which is born of the pleasure felt by the spirit in immobility and silence
the soul of the child wishes to free itself from the irksomeness of sounds that are too loud from obstacles to its peace during work
these children with the grace of pages to a noble lord are serving their spirits
this exercise develops very definitely the social spirit
no other lesson no other situation could do the same
a profound silence can be obtained even when more than fifty children are crowded together in a small space provided that the children know how to keep still and want to do it but one disturber is enough to take away the charm
here is demonstration of the cooperation of all the members of a community to achieve a common end
the children gradually show increased power of many of them rather than disturb the silence refrain from brushing a fly off the nose or suppress a cough or sneeze
the same exhibition of collective action is seen in the care with which the children move to avoid making a noise during their work
the lightness with which they run on tiptoe the grace with which they shut a cupboard or lay an object on the table these are qualities that must be by if the environment is to become tranquil and free from disturbance
one rebel is sufficient to mar this achievement one noisy child walking on his heels or banging the door can disturb the peaceful atmosphere of the small community
language and knowledge of the world the special importance of the sense of hearing comes from the fact that it is the sense organ connected with speech
therefore to train the child attention to follow sounds and noises which are produced in the environment to recognize them and to discriminate between them is to prepare his attention to follow more accurately the sounds of articulate language
the teacher must be careful to pronounce clearly and completely the sounds of the word when she speaks to a child even though she may be speaking in a low voice almost as if telling him a secret
the children songs are also a good means for obtaining exact pronunciation
the teacher when she teaches them pronounces slowly separating the component sounds of the word pronounced
but a special opportunity for training in clear and exact speech occurs when the lessons are given in the nomenclature relating to the sensory exercises
in every exercise when the child has the differences between the qualities of the objects the teacher fixes the idea of this quality with a word
thus when the child has many times built and rebuilt the tower of the pink cubes at an opportune moment the teacher draws near him and taking the two extreme cubes the largest and the smallest and showing them to him says this is large this is small
the two words only and are pronounced several times in succession with strong emphasis and with a very clear pronunciation this is large large after which there is a moment pause
then the teacher to see if the child has understood verifies with the following tests give me the large one
finally the teacher pointing to the objects in turn asks what is this
the child if he has learned replies rightly large small
the teacher then urges the child to repeat the words always more clearly and as accurately as possible
and objects are those which differ only in size and not in form that is all three dimensions change more or less proportionally
we should say that a house is large and a hut is small
when two pictures represent the same objects in different dimensions one can be said to be an enlargement of the other
when however only the dimensions referring to the section of the object change while the length remains the same the objects are respectively thick and thin
we should say of two posts of equal height but different that one is thick and the other is thin
the teacher therefore gives a lesson on the brown prisms similar to that with the cubes in the three periods which i have described
there is a way of helping the child to recognize differences in dimension and to place the objects in correct gradation
after the lesson which i have described the teacher scatters the brown prisms for instance on a carpet says to the child give me the thickest of all and lays the object on a table
then again she invites the child to look for piece among those scattered on the floor and every time the piece chosen is laid in its order on the table next to the piece previously chosen
in this way the child accustoms himself always to look either for the or the among the rest and so has a guide to help him to lay the pieces in gradation
when there is one dimension only which varies as in the case of the rods the objects are said to be long and short the varying dimension being length
when the varying dimension is height the objects are said to be tall and short when the breadth varies they are broad and narrow
of these three varieties we offer the child as a fundamental lesson only that in which the varies and we teach the differences by means of the usual three periods and by asking him to select from the pile at one time always the longest at another always the shortest
the child in this way acquires great accuracy in the use of words
one day the teacher had ruled the blackboard with very fine lines
they are not small corrected another they are
when the names to be taught are those of colors or of forms so that it is not necessary to emphasize contrast between extremes the teacher can give more than two names at the same time as for instance this is red
in the case of a however the teacher will select if she is teaching the colors the two extremes dark and light then making choice always of the darkest and the lightest
many of the lessons here described can be seen in the cinematograph pictures lessons on touching the plane insets and the surfaces in walking on the line in color memory in the nomenclature relating to the cubes and the long rods in the composition of words reading writing etc
by means of these lessons the child comes to know many words very thoroughly large small thick thin long short dark light rough smooth heavy light hot cold and the names of many colors and geometrical forms
such words do not relate to any particular but to a psychic acquisition on the part of the child
in fact the name is given a long in which the child concentrating his attention on different qualities of objects has made comparisons reasoned and formed judgments until he has acquired a power of discrimination which he did not possess before
in a word he has his his observation of things has been thorough and fundamental he has
he finds himself therefore facing the world with qualities refined and quickened
his powers of observation and of recognition have greatly increased
further the mental images which he has succeeded in establishing are not a confused medley they are all classified forms are distinct from dimensions and dimensions are classed according to the qualities which result from the combinations of varying dimensions
all these are quite distinct from
colors are divided according to tint and to richness of tone silence is distinct from noises from sounds and everything has its own exact and appropriate name
the child then has not only developed in himself special qualities of observation and of judgment but the objects which he observes may be said to go into their place according to the order established in his mind and they are placed under their appropriate name in an exact classification
does not the student of the experimental sciences prepare himself in the same way to observe the outside world
he may find himself like the uneducated man in the midst of the most diverse natural objects but he differs from the uneducated man in that he has for observation
if he is a worker with the microscope his eyes are trained to see in the range of the microscope certain minute details which the ordinary man can not distinguish
if he is an astronomer he will look through the same telescope as the curious visitor or but he will see much more clearly
the same plants surround the botanist and the ordinary wayfarer but the botanist sees in every plant those qualities which are classified in his mind and assigns to each plant its own place in the natural orders giving it its exact name
it is this capacity for recognizing a plant in a complex order of classification which distinguishes the botanist from the ordinary gardener and it is and scientific language which characterizes the trained observer
now the scientist who has developed special qualities of observation and who possesses an order in which to classify external objects will be the man to make scientific
it will never be he who without preparation and order wanders dreaming among plants or beneath the starlit sky
in fact our little ones have the impression of continually making discoveries in the world about them and in this they find the greatest joy
they take from the world a knowledge which is ordered and inspires them with enthusiasm
into their minds there enters the creation instead of the chaos and it seems that their souls find therein a divine exultation
freedom the success of these results is closely connected with the delicate intervention of the one who guides the children in their development
it is necessary for the teacher to
the child without letting him feel her presence too much so that she may be always ready to supply the desired help but may never be the obstacle between the child and his experience
a lesson in the ordinary use of the word cools the child enthusiasm for the knowledge of things just as it would cool the enthusiasm of adults
to keep alive that enthusiasm is the secret of real guidance and it will not prove a difficult task provided that the attitude towards the child acts be that of respect calm and waiting and provided that he be left free in his movements and in his experiences
then we shall notice that the child has a personality which he is seeking to expand he has initiative he chooses his own work persists in it changes it according to his inner needs he does not shirk effort he rather goes in search of it and with great joy overcomes obstacles within his capacity
he is sociable to the extent of wanting to share with every one his successes his discoveries and his little triumphs
there is therefore no need of intervention
that is the motto for the educator
let us wait and be always ready to share in both the joys and the difficulties which the child experiences
he himself invites our sympathy and we should respond fully and gladly
let us have endless patience with his slow progress and show enthusiasm and gladness at his successes
if we could say we are respectful and courteous in our dealings with children we treat them as we should like to be treated ourselves we should certainly have mastered a great educational principle and undoubtedly be setting an of good
what we all desire for ourselves namely not to be disturbed in our work not to find hindrances to our efforts to have good friends ready to help us in times of need to see them rejoice with us to be on terms of equality with them to be able to confide and trust in them this is what we need for happy companionship
in the same way children are human beings to whom respect is due superior to us by reason of their innocence and of the greater possibilities of their future
what we desire they desire also
as a rule however we do not respect our children
we try to force them to follow us without regard to their special needs
we are overbearing with them and above all rude and then we expect them to be submissive and knowing all the time how strong is their instinct of imitation and how touching their faith in and admiration of us
they will imitate us in any case
let us treat them therefore with all the kindness which we would wish to help to develop in them
and by kindness is not meant caresses
should we not call anyone who embraced us at the first time of meeting rude vulgar and
kindness consists in interpreting the wishes of others in conforming one self to them and sacrificing if need be one own desire
this is the kindness which we must show towards children
to find the interpretation of children desires we must study them scientifically for their desires are often unconscious
they are the inner cry of life which wishes to unfold according to mysterious laws
we know very little of the way in which it unfolds
certainly the child is growing into a man by force of a divine action similar to that by which from nothing he became a child
our intervention in this marvelous process is we are here to offer to this life which came into the world by itself the necessary for its development and having done that we must await this development with respect
let us leave the life to develop within the limits of the good and let us observe this inner life developing
this is the whole of our mission
perhaps as we watch we shall be reminded of the words of him who was absolutely good suffer the little children to come unto me
that is to say do not hinder them from coming since if they are left free and unhampered they will come
writing the child who has completed all the exercises above described and is thus for an advance towards unexpected conquests is about four years old
he is not an unknown quantity as are children who have been left to gain varied and casual experiences by themselves and who therefore differ in type and intellectual standard not only according to their natures but especially according to the chances and opportunities they have found for their spontaneous inner formation
education has an for the children
individual differences to be found in them can therefore be put down almost exclusively to each one individual nature
owing to their environment which offers adapted and measured to meet the needs of their psychical development our children have acquired a fundamental type which is common to all
their movements in various kinds of manual work about the house and so have acquired a characteristic independence of action and initiative in the adaptation of their actions to their environment
out of all this emerges a for the children have become little men who are
the special attention necessary to handle small fragile objects without breaking them and to move heavy articles without making a noise has endowed the movements of the whole body with a lightness and grace which are characteristic of our children
it is a deep feeling of responsibility which has brought them to such a pitch of perfection
for instance when they carry three or four tumblers at a time or a tureen of hot soup they know that they are responsible not only for the objects but also for the success of the meal which at that moment they are directing
in the same way each child feels the responsibility of the silence of the prevention of harsh sounds and he knows how to cooperate for the general good in keeping the environment not only orderly but quiet and calm
indeed our children have taken the road which leads them to mastery of themselves
but their formation is due to a deeper psychological work still arising from the education of the senses
in addition to ordering their environment and ordering themselves in their outward personalities they have also ordered the inner world of their minds
the didactic material in fact does not offer to the child the content of the mind but the for that content
it causes him to distinguish identities from differences extreme differences from fine gradations and to classify under conceptions of quality and of quantity the most varying sensations appertaining to surfaces colors dimensions forms and sounds
the mind has formed itself by a special exercise of attention observing comparing and classifying
the mental attitude acquired by such an exercise leads the child to make ordered observations in his environment observations which prove as interesting to him as discoveries and so stimulate him to multiply them indefinitely and to form in his mind a rich content of clear ideas
language now comes to by means of
the ideas which the mind has acquired
these words are few in number and have reference not to separate objects but rather to the of the which have been formed in the mind
in this way the children are able to find themselves alike in the world of natural things and in the world of objects and of words which surround them for they have an inner guide which leads them to become and intelligent instead of wandering wayfarers in an unknown land
these are the children who in a short space of time sometimes in a few days learn to write and to perform the first operations of arithmetic
it is not a fact that children in general can do it as many have believed
it is not a case of giving my material for writing to unprepared children and of awaiting the miracle
the fact is that the minds and hands of our children are already for writing and ideas of quantity of identity of differences and of gradation which form the bases of all calculation have been maturing for a long time in them
one might say that all their previous education is a preparation for the first stages of essential culture and that knowledge comes as an easy spontaneous and logical consequence of the preparation that it is in fact its natural
we have already seen that the purpose of the is to fix ideas and to facilitate the elementary comprehension of
in the same way writing and arithmetic now fix the complex inner acquisitions of the mind which proceeds henceforward continually to enrich itself by fresh observations
our children have long been preparing the hand for writing
throughout all the sensory exercises the hand whilst cooperating with the mind in its attainments and in its work of formation was preparing its own future
when the hand learned to hold itself lightly suspended over a horizontal surface in order to touch rough and smooth when it took the cylinders of the solid insets and placed them in their apertures when with two fingers it touched the outlines of the geometrical forms it was coordinating movements and the child is now ready almost impatient to use them in the fascinating synthesis of writing
the preparation for writing also consists in exercises of the movements of the hand
there are two series of exercises very different from one another
i have analyzed the movements which are connected with writing and i prepare them separately one from the other
when we write we perform a movement for the of the instrument of writing a movement which generally acquires an individual character so that a person handwriting can be recognized and in certain medical cases changes in the nervous system can be traced by the corresponding alterations in the handwriting
in fact it is from the handwriting that specialists in that subject would interpret the of individuals
writing has besides this a general character which has reference to the form of the alphabetical signs
when a man writes he combines these two parts but they actually exist as the parts of a single and can be prepared apart
exercises for the management of the instrument of the individual part
in the didactic material there are two sloping wooden boards on each of which stand five square metal frames colored pink
in each of these is inserted a blue geometrical figure similar to the geometrical insets and provided with a small button for a handle
with this material we use a box of ten colored pencils and a little book of designs which i have prepared after five years ' experience of observing the children
i have chosen and graduated the designs according to the use which the children made of them
the two sloping boards are set side by side and on them are placed ten complete insets that is to say the frames with the geometrical figures
the child is given a sheet of white paper and the box of ten colored pencils
he will then choose one of the ten metal insets which are arranged in an attractive line at a certain distance from him
the child is taught the following process
he lays the frame of the iron inset on the sheet of paper and holding it down firmly with one hand he follows with a colored pencil the interior outline which describes a geometrical figure
then he lifts the square frame and finds drawn upon the paper an enclosed geometrical form a triangle a circle a hexagon etc
the child has not actually performed a new exercise because he had already performed all these movements when he
the only new feature of the exercise is that he follows the outlines no longer directly with his finger but through the medium of a pencil
that is he he leaves a of his movement
the child finds this exercise easy and most interesting and as soon as he has succeeded in making the first outline he places above it the piece of blue metal corresponding to it
this is an exercise exactly similar to that which he performed when he placed the wooden geometrical figures upon the cards of the third series where the figures are only contained by a simple line
this time however when the action of placing the form upon the outline is performed the child takes colored and draws the outline of the blue metal figure
when he raises it if the drawing is well done he finds upon the paper a geometrical figure contained by two outlines in colors and if the colors have been well chosen the result is very attractive and the child who has already had a considerable education of the chromatic sense is keenly interested in it
these may seem unnecessary details but as a matter of fact they are
for instance if instead of arranging the ten metal insets in a row the teacher distributes them among the children without thus exhibiting them the child exercises are much limited
when on the other hand the insets are exhibited before his eyes he feels the desire to draw them one after the other and the number of exercises is increased
the two rouse the desire of the child to see another combination of colors and then to repeat the experience
the variety of the objects and the colors are therefore an to work and hence to final success
here the actual preparatory movement for writing begins
when the child has drawn the figure in double outline he takes hold of a pencil like a pen for writing and draws marks up and down until he has completely filled the figure
in this way a definite figure remains on the paper similar to the figures on the cards of the first series
this figure can be in any of the ten colors
at first the children fill in the figures very clumsily without regard for the outlines making very heavy lines and not keeping them parallel
little by little however the drawings improve in that they keep within the outlines and the lines increase in number grow finer and are parallel to one another
when the child has begun these exercises he is seized with a desire to continue them and he never tires of drawing the outlines of the figures and then filling them in
each child suddenly becomes the possessor of a considerable number of drawings and he treasures them up in his own little drawer
the movement of writing which brings him the management of the
this movement in ordinary methods is represented by the wearisome pothook connected with the first laborious and tedious attempts at writing
the organization of this movement which began from the guidance of a piece of metal is as yet rough and imperfect and the child now passes on to the in of the prepared in the little album
the leaves are taken from the book one by one in the order of progression in which they are arranged and the child fills in the prepared designs with colored pencils in the same way as before
here the choice of the colors is another intelligent occupation which encourages the child to multiply the tasks
he chooses the colors by himself and with much taste
the delicacy of the shades which he chooses and the harmony with which he arranges them in these designs show us that the common belief that children love and colors has been the result of observation of without who have been abandoned to the rough and harsh experiences of an environment unfitted for them
the education of the chromatic sense becomes at this point of a child development the
which enables him to become possessed of a firm bold and beautiful handwriting
the drawings lend themselves to in very many ways length of the strokes with which they are filled
the child will have to fill in geometrical figures both large and small of a pavement design or flowers and leaves or the various details of an animal or of a landscape
in this way the hand accustoms itself not only to perform the general action but also to confine the movement within all kinds of limits
hence the child is preparing himself to write in a handwriting large or small
indeed later on he will write as well between the wide lines on a blackboard as between the narrow closely ruled lines of an exercise book generally used by much older children
the number of exercises which the child performs with the drawings is practically unlimited
he will often take another colored pencil and draw over again the outlines of the figure already filled in with color
a help to the of the exercise is to be found in the further education of the chromatic sense which the child acquires by painting the same designs in
later he mixes colors for himself until he can imitate the colors of nature or create the delicate tints which his own imagination desires
it is not possible however to speak of all this in detail within the limits of this small work
exercises for the writing of alphabetical
in the didactic material there are series of boxes which contain the alphabetical signs
at this point we take those cards which are covered with very smooth paper to which is gummed a letter of the alphabet cut out in sandpaper
there are also large cards on which are gummed several letters grouped together according to analogy of form
the children have to over the alphabetical signs as though they were writing
they touch them with the tips of the index and middle fingers in the same way as when they touched the wooden insets and with the hand raised as when they lightly touched the rough and smooth surfaces
the teacher herself touches the letters to show the child how the movement should be performed and the child if he has had much practise in touching the wooden insets
without the previous practise however the child hand does not follow the letter with accuracy and it is most interesting to make close observations of the children in order to understand the importance of a motor for writing and also to realize the strain which we impose upon the children when we set them to write directly without a previous motor education of the hand
the child finds great pleasure in touching the sandpaper letters
it is an exercise by which he applies to a new attainment the power he has already acquired through exercising the sense of touch
whilst the child touches a letter the teacher pronounces its sound and she uses for the lesson the usual three periods
thus for example presenting the two vowels she will have the child touch them slowly and accurately and repeat their relative sounds one after the other as the child touches them i i i o o o
then she will say to the child give me i
finally she will ask the question what is this
she proceeds in the same way through all the other letters giving in the case of the consonants not the name but only the sound
the child then touches the letters by himself over and over again either on the separate cards or on the large cards on which several letters are gummed and in this way he establishes the movements necessary for tracing the alphabetical signs
at the same time he retains the image of the letter
this process forms the first preparation not only for writing but also for reading because it is evident that when the child
the letters he performs the movement corresponding to the writing of them and at the same time when he recognizes them by sight he is reading the alphabet
the child has thus prepared in effect all the necessary movements for writing therefore he
this important conquest is the result of a long period of inner formation of which the child is not clearly aware
but a day will come very soon when he and that will be a day of great surprise for him the wonderful harvest of an unknown sowing
the alphabet of movable letters cut out in pink and blue cardboard and kept in a special box with compartments serves for the composition of words
in a phonetic language like italian it is enough to pronounce clearly the different component sounds of a word as for example so that the child whose ear is may recognize one by one the component sounds
then he looks in the movable alphabet for the corresponding to each separate sound and lays them one beside the other thus composing the word for instance mano
gradually he will become able to do the same thing with words of which he thinks himself he succeeds in breaking them up into their component sounds and in translating them into a row of signs
when the child has composed the words in this way he knows how to read them
in this method therefore all the processes leading to writing include reading as well
if the language is not phonetic the teacher can compose separate words with the movable alphabet and then pronounce them letting the child repeat by himself the exercise of arranging and rereading them
in the material there are two movable alphabets
one of them consists of larger letters and is divided into two boxes each of which contains the vowels
this is used for the first exercises in which the child needs very large objects in order to recognize the letters
when he is acquainted with one half of the consonants he can begin to compose words even though he is dealing with one part only of the alphabet
the other movable alphabet has smaller letters and is contained in a single box
it is given to children who have made their first attempts at composition with words and already know the complete alphabet
it is after these exercises with the movable alphabet that the child able to write entire
this phenomenon generally occurs unexpectedly and then a child who has never yet traced a stroke or a letter on paper several words in
from that moment he continues to write always gradually perfecting himself
this spontaneous writing takes on the characteristics of a phenomenon and the child who has begun to write the first word will continue to write in the same way as he spoke after pronouncing the first word and as he walked after having taken the first step
the same course of inner formation through which the phenomenon of writing appeared is the course of his future progress of his growth to perfection
the child prepared in this way has entered upon a course of development through which he will pass as surely as the growth of the body and the development of the natural functions have passed through their course of development when life has once been established
for the interesting and very complex phenomena relating to the development of writing and then of reading see my larger works
the reading of music illustration fig
the single staff is used in the conservatoire of milan and utilized in the perlasca method
when the child knows how to read he can make a first application of this knowledge to the reading of the names of musical notes
in connection with the material for sensory education consisting of the series of bells we use a didactic material which serves as an introduction to musical reading
for this purpose we have in the first place a wooden board not very long and painted pale green
on this board the staff is cut out in black and in every line and space are cut round holes inside each of which is written the name of the note in its reference to the treble clef
there is also a series of little white discs which can be fitted into the holes
on one side of each disc is written the name of the note doh re mi fah soh lah ti doh
the child guided by the name written on the discs puts them with the name uppermost in their right places on the board and then reads the names of the notes
this exercise he can do by himself and he learns the position of each note on the staff
another exercise which the child can do at the same time is to place the disc bearing the name of the note on the rectangular base of the corresponding bell whose sound he has already learned to recognize by ear in the sensorial exercise described above
dumb keyboard following this exercise there is another staff made on a board of green wood which is longer than the other and has neither indentures nor signs
a considerable number of discs on one side of which are written the names of the notes is at the disposal of the child
he takes up a disc at random reads its name and places it on the staff with the name underneath so that the white face of the disc shows on the top
by the repetition of this exercise the child is enabled to arrange many discs on the same line or in the same space
when he has finished he turns them all over so that the names are outside and so finds out if he has made mistakes
after learning the treble clef the child passes on to learn the bass with great ease
to the staff described above can be added another similar to it arranged as is shown in the figure
the child beginning with doh lays the discs on the board in ascending order in their right position until the octave is reached doh re mi fah soh lah ti doh
then he descends the scale in the same way returning to but continuing to place the discs always to the right soh fah mi re doh
at this point he descends again to the lower staff ti lah soh fah mi re doh then he ascends again on the other side re mi fah soh lah ti and by forming with his two lines of discs another angle in the bass he has completed a rhombus the rhombus of the notes
after the discs have been arranged in this way the upper staff is separated from the lower
in the lower the notes are arranged according to the bass clef
in this way the first elements of musical reading are presented to the child reading which corresponds to with which the child ear is already acquainted
for a first practical application of this knowledge we have used in our schools a miniature pianoforte keyboard which reproduces the essentials of this instrument although in a simplified form and so that they are visible
two octaves only are reproduced and the keys which are small are proportioned to the hand of a little child of four or five years as the keys of the common piano are proportioned to those of the adult
all the mechanism of the key is visible
on striking a key one sees the hammer rise on which is written the name of the note
the hammers are black and white like the notes
with this instrument it is very easy for the child to practise alone finding the notes on the keyboard corresponding to some bar of written music and following the movements of the fingers made in playing the piano
the keyboard in itself is mute but a series of resonant tubes resembling a set of can be applied to the upper surface so
that the hammers striking these produce musical notes corresponding to the keys struck
the child can then pursue his exercises with the control of the musical sounds
on the wooden board round spaces are cut out corresponding to the notes
inside each of the spaces there is a figure
on one side of each of the discs is written a number and on the other the name of the note
they are fitted by the child into the corresponding places
the child next arranged the discs in the notes cut out on the staff but there are no longer numbers written to help him find the places
instead he must try to remember the place of the note on the staff
if he is not sure he consults the numbered board fig
the child arranged on the staff the semitones in the spaces which remain where the discs are far apart
the discs for the semitones have the sharp on one side and the flat on the other re sharp flat are written on the opposite sides of the same disc
the children take a large number of discs and arrange them on the staff leaving uppermost the side which is blank the side on which the name of the note is not written
then they verify their work by turning the discs over and reading the name
the double staff is formed by putting the two staves together
the children arrange the notes in the form of a rhombus
the two boards are then separated and the notes remain arranged according to the treble and bass clefs
the corresponding key signatures are then placed upon the two different staves
arithmetic the children possess all the instinctive knowledge necessary as a preparation for clear ideas on numeration
the idea of quantity was inherent in all the material for the education of the senses longer shorter darker lighter
the conception of identity and of difference formed part of the actual technique of the education of the senses which began with the recognition of identical objects and continued with the arrangement in gradation of similar objects
i will make a special illustration of the first exercise with the solid insets which can be done even by a child of two and a half
when he makes a mistake by putting a cylinder in a hole too large for it and so leaves cylinder without a place he instinctively absorbs the idea of the absence of from a continuous series
the child mind is not prepared for number by certain preliminary ideas given in haste by the teacher but has been prepared for it by a process of formation by a slow building up of itself
to enter directly upon the teaching of arithmetic we must turn to the same didactic material used for the education of the senses
let us look at the three sets of material which are presented after the exercises with the solid insets the material for teaching
the pink cubes the brown prisms and
there is a definite relation between the ten pieces of each series
in the material for length the shortest piece is a of for all the rest the second piece is double the first the third is three times the first and whilst the scale of length increases by ten centimeters for each piece the other dimensions remain constant the rods all have the same section
the pieces then stand in the same relation to one another as the natural series of the numbers
in the second series namely that which shows whilst the length remains constant the square section of the prisms varies
the result is that the sides of the square sections vary according to the series of natural numbers in the first prism the square of the section has sides of one centimeter in the second of two centimeters in the third of three centimeters and so on until the tenth in which the square of the section has sides of ten centimeters
the prisms therefore are in the same proportion to one another as the numbers of the series of squares    etc for it would take four prisms of the first size to make the second nine to make the third etc
the pieces which make up the series for teaching thickness are therefore in the following proportion
in the case of the pink cubes the edge increases according to the numerical series the first cube has an edge of one centimeter the second of two centimeters the third of three centimeters and so on to the tenth cube which has an edge of ten centimeters
hence the relation in volume between them is that of the cubes of the series of numbers from one to ten
in fact to make up the volume of the second pink cube eight of the first little cubes would be required to make up the volume of the third would be required and so on
illustration a b                                                        fig
the children have an intuitive knowledge of this difference for they realize that the exercise with the pink cubes is the of all three and that with the rods the most difficult
when we begin the direct teaching of number we choose the long rods modifying them however by dividing them into ten spaces each ten centimeters in length colored alternately red and blue
for example the rod which is four times as long as the first is clearly seen to be composed of four equal lengths red and blue and similarly with all the rest
when the rods have been placed in order of gradation we teach the child the numbers one two three by touching the rods in succession from the first up to ten
then to help him to gain a clear idea of number we proceed to the recognition of separate rods by means of the customary lesson in three periods
we lay the three first rods in front of the child and pointing to them or taking them in the hand in turn in order to show them to him we say this is
we point out with the finger the divisions in each rod counting them so as to make sure one two this is
then we say to the child give me
finally pointing to a rod we say what is this
the child answers three and we count together one two three
in the same way we teach all the other rods in their order adding always one or two more according to the responsiveness of the child
the importance of this didactic material is that it gives a clear idea of
for when a number is named it exists as an object a unity in itself
when we say that a man possesses a million we mean that he has a which is worth so many units of measure of values and these units all belong to one person
so if we add  to    we add a to a and these numbers for a reason represent in themselves groups of homogeneous units
again when the child shows us the  he is handling a rod which is inflexible an object complete in itself yet composed of equal which can be counted
and when he comes to add  to  he will place next to one another two rods two objects one of which has eight equal lengths and the other two
when on the other hand in ordinary schools to make the calculation easier they present the child with different objects to count such as beans marbles and when to take the case i have quoted   he takes a group of eight marbles and adds two more marbles to it the natural impression in his mind is not that he has added  to  but that he has added         to
the result is not so clear and the child is required to make the effort of holding in his mind the idea of a group of eight objects as united corresponding to a single number
this effort often puts the child back and delays his understanding of number by months or even years
the addition and subtraction of numbers under ten are made very much simpler by the use of the didactic material for teaching lengths
let the child be presented with the attractive problem of arranging the pieces in such a way as to have a set of rods all as long as the longest
he first arranges the rods in their right order the long stair he then takes the last rod  and lays it next to the
similarly he takes the last rod but one  and lays it next to the  and so on up to the
this very simple game represents the addition of numbers within the ten
then when he puts the rods back in their places he must first take away the  and put it back under the  and then take away in their turn the  the  the
by this action he has put the rods back again in their right gradation but he has also performed a series of arithmetical subtractions
the teaching of the actual figures marks an advance from the rods to the process of counting with separate units
when the figures are known they will serve the very purpose in the abstract which the rods serve in the concrete that is they will stand for the into one of a certain number of separate units
the function of language and the wide field of work which it opens out for the intelligence is we might say by the function of the which now can be substituted for the concrete rods
the use of the actual rods only would limit arithmetic to the small operations within the ten or numbers a little higher and in the construction of the mind these operations would advance very little farther than the limits of the first simple and elementary education of the senses
the figure which is a word a graphic sign will permit of that unlimited progress which the mathematical mind of man has been able to make in the course of its evolution
in the material there is a box containing smooth cards on which are gummed the figures from one to nine cut out in sandpaper
these are analogous to the cards on which are gummed the sandpaper letters of the alphabet
the method of teaching is always the same
the figures in the direction in which they are written and to name them at the same time
in this case he does more than when he learned the letters he is shown how to place each figure upon the corresponding rod
when all the figures have been learned in this way one of the first exercises will be to place the number cards upon the rods arranged in gradation
so arranged they form a succession of steps on which it is a pleasure to place the cards and the children remain for a long time repeating this intelligent game
after this exercise comes what we may call the emancipation of the child
he carried his own figures with him and now
he will know how to group units together
for this purpose we have in the didactic material a series of wooden pegs but in addition to these we give the children all sorts of small objects sticks tiny cubes counters etc
the exercise will consist in placing opposite a figure the number of objects that it indicates
the child for this purpose can use the box which is included in the material
this box is divided into compartments above each of which is printed a figure and the child places in the compartment the corresponding number of pegs
another exercise is to lay all the figures on the table and place below them the corresponding number of cubes counters etc
this is only the first step and it would be impossible here to speak of the succeeding lessons in zero in tens and in other arithmetical processes for the development of which my larger works must be consulted
the didactic material itself however can give some idea
in the box containing the pegs there is one compartment over which the  is printed
inside this compartment nothing must be put and then we begin with
zero is nothing but it is placed next to one to enable us to count when we pass beyond  thus
if instead of the piece  we were to take pieces as long as the rod  we could count
in the didactic material there are frames containing cards on which are printed such numbers from  to
these numbers are fixed into a frame in such a way that the figures  to  can be slipped in covering the zero
if the zero of  is covered by  the result is  if with  it becomes  and so on until the last
then we pass to the twenties the second ten and so on from ten to ten
for the beginning of this exercise with the cards marking the tens we can use the rods
as we begin with the first ten  in the frame we take the rod
we then place the small rod  next to rod  and at the same time slip in the number  covering the zero of the
then we take rod  and figure  away from the frame and put in their place rod  next to rod  and figure  over the zero in the frame and so on up to
to advance farther we should need to use two rods of  to make
the children show much enthusiasm when learning these exercises which demand from them two sets of activities and give them in their work clearness of idea
in writing and arithmetic we have gathered the fruits of a laborious education which consisted in coordinating the movements and gaining a first knowledge of the world
this culture comes as a natural consequence of man first efforts to put himself into intelligent communication with the world
all those early acquisitions which have brought order into the child mind would be wasted were they not firmly established by means of written language and of figures
thus established however these experiences open up an unlimited field for future education
what we have done therefore is to introduce the child to a higher level the level of culture and he will now be able to pass on to a but not the school we know where irrationally we try to give culture to minds not yet prepared or to receive
to preserve the health of their minds which have been and not
by the order of the work our children must have a new kind of school for the acquisition of culture
my experiments in the continuation of this method for older children are already far advanced
a brief description such as this of the which are used in the children house may perhaps give the reader the impression of a logical and convincing system of education
but the importance of my method does not lie in the organization itself but the effects which it produces on the
it is the who proves the value of this method by his spontaneous manifestations which seem to reveal the laws of man inner development b psychology will perhaps find in the children houses a laboratory which will bring more truths to light than thus hitherto recognized for the essential factor in psychological research especially in the field of psychogenesis the origin and development of the mind must be the establishment of normal conditions for the free development of thought
b see the chapters on discipline in my larger works
as is well known we leave the children in their work and in all actions which are not of a disturbing kind
that is we disorder which is bad but allow to that which is orderly and good the most complete liberty of manifestation
the results obtained are surprising for the children have shown a love of work which no one suspected to be in them and a calm and an orderliness in their movements which surpassing the limits of correctness have entered into those of grace
the spontaneous discipline and the obedience which is seen in the whole class constitute the most striking result of our method
the ancient philosophical discussion as to whether man is born good or evil is often brought forward in connection with my method and many who have supported it have done so on the ground that it provides a demonstration of man natural goodness
very many others on the contrary have opposed it considering that to leave children free is a dangerous mistake since they have in them innate tendencies to evil
i should like to put the question upon a more positive plane
in the words good and evil we include the most varying ideas and we confuse them especially our practical dealings with little
the tendencies which we stigmatize as in little children of three to six years of age are often merely those which cause to us adults when not understanding their needs we try to prevent their their every to gain experience for themselves in the by touching everything etc
the child however through this is led to his and to collect impressions especially sensations of touch so that when prevented he and this rebellion forms almost the whole of his naughtiness
what wonder is it that the evil disappears when if we give the right for development and leave full liberty to use them rebellion has no more reason for existence
further by the substitution of a series of outbursts of for the old series of outbursts of the moral physiognomy of the child comes to assume a calm and gentleness which make him appear a different being
it is we who provoked the children to the violent manifestations of a real for
in order to exist to the needs of their psychic
they were often obliged to snatch from us the things which seemed necessary to them for the purpose
they had to move contrary to our laws or sometimes to struggle with other children to wrest from them the objects of their desire
on the other hand if we give children the of the struggle for it disappears and a vigorous expansion of life takes its place
this question involves a hygienic principle connected with the nervous system during the difficult period when the brain is still rapidly growing and should be of great interest to specialists in children diseases and nervous derangements
the inner life of man and the beginnings of his intellect are controlled by special laws and vital necessities which can not be forgotten if we are aiming at health for mankind
for this reason an educational method which cultivates and protects the inner activities of the child is not a question which concerns merely the school or the teachers it is a universal question which concerns the family and is of vital interest to mothers
to go more deeply into a question is often the only means of answering it rightly
if for instance we were to see men fighting over a piece of bread we might say how bad men are
if on the other hand we entered a and saw them quietly finding a place and choosing their meal without any envy of one another we might say how good men are
evidently the question of absolute good and evil intuitive ideas of which guide us in our superficial judgment goes beyond such limitations as these
we can for instance provide excellent for an entire people without directly affecting the question of their morals
one might say indeed that to judge by appearances a people are quieter and commit less than a nation that is but whoever draws from that the conclusion that to make men good it is to feed them will be making an obvious mistake
it can not be denied however that will be an essential factor in obtaining goodness in the sense that it will all the acts and the caused by lack of bread
now in our case we are dealing with a far deeper need the nourishment of man inner life and of his higher functions
the bread that we are dealing with is the bread of the spirit and we are entering into the difficult subject of the satisfaction of man psychic needs
we have already obtained a most interesting result in that we have found it possible to present of enabling children to reach a higher level of calm and goodness and we have been able to establish these means by experience
the whole foundation of our results rests upon these means which we have discovered and which may be divided under two heads the of and liberty
it is the perfect organization of work permitting the possibility of and giving outlet for the energies which procures for each child the beneficial and calming
and it is under such conditions of work that liberty leads to a perfecting of the activities and to the attainment of a fine discipline which is in itself the result of that new quality of that has been developed in the child
freedom without organization of work would be useless
the child left without means of work would go to waste just as a baby if without nourishment would die of starvation
the organization of the therefore is the of this new structure of goodness but even that organization would be in vain without the to make use of it and without freedom for the expansion of all those energies which spring from the satisfaction of the child highest activities
has not a similar phenomenon occurred also in the history of man
the history of civilization is a history of successful attempts to organize work and to obtain liberty
on the whole man goodness has also increased as is shown by his progress from barbarism to civilization and it may be said that crime the various forms of wickedness cruelty and violence have been gradually decreasing during this passage of time
the of our times as a matter of fact has been compared to a form of
surviving in the midst of civilized peoples
it is therefore through the better organization of work that society will probably attain to a further purification and in the meanwhile it seems unconsciously to be seeking the overthrow of the last barriers between itself and liberty
if this is what we learn from society how great should be the results among little children from three to six years of age if the organization of their work is complete and their freedom absolute
it is for this reason that to us they seem so good like heralds of hope and of redemption
if men walking as yet so painfully and imperfectly along the road of work and of freedom have become better why should we fear that the same road will prove disastrous to the children
yet on the other hand i would not say that the goodness of our little ones in their freedom will solve the problem of the absolute goodness or wickedness of man
we can only say that we have made a contribution to the cause of goodness by removing obstacles which were the cause of violence and of rebellion
let us render therefore unto c√¶sar the things that are c√¶sar and unto god the things that are god

the writer of this text has been doubly gratified however at the cordial reception and widespread use accorded to the present volume
this feeling does not arise from any narrow personal pride or selfish interest but rather from the fact that the warm approval of the educational public has proved an important point namely that the fundamental truths of psychology when put simply and concretely can be made of interest and value to students of all ages from high school juniors up and to the general public as well
more encouraging still it has been demonstrated that the teachings of psychology can become immediately helpful not only in study or teaching but also in business or profession in the control and guidance of the personal life and in the problems met in the routine of the day work or its play
in effecting the present revision the salient features of the original edition have been kept
the truths presented are the most fundamental and important in the field of psychology
disputed theories and unsettled opinions are excluded
the subject matter is made concrete and practical by the use of many illustrations and through application to real problems
the style has been kept easy and familiar to facilitate the reading
in short there has been while seeking to improve the volume a conscious purpose to omit none of the characteristics which secured acceptance for the former edition
on the other hand certain changes and additions have been made which it is believed will add to the strength of the work
first of all the later psychological studies and investigations have been drawn upon to insure that the matter shall at all points be abreast of the times in scientific accuracy
because of the wide use of the text in the training of teachers a more specific educational application to schoolroom problems has been made in various chapters
exercises for the guidance of observation work and personal introspection are freely used
the chapter on sensation and perception has been separated into two chapters and each subject given more extensive treatment
a new chapter has been added on association
the various chapters have been subdivided into numbered sections and paragraph topics have been used to facilitate the study and teaching of the text
minor changes and additions occur throughout the volume thus adding some forty pages to the number in the original edition
many of the modifications made in the revision are due to valuable suggestions and kindly criticisms received from many teachers of the text in various types of schools
to all who have thus helped so generously by freely giving the author the fruits of their judgment and experience he gladly renders grateful thanks

the mind and its education chapter
we are to study the mind and its education but how
it is easy to understand how we may investigate the great world of material things about us for we can see it touch it weigh it or measure it
but how are we to discover the nature of the mind or come to know the processes by which consciousness works
for mind is intangible we can not see it feel it taste it or handle it
mind belongs not to the realm of matter which is known to the senses but to the realm of which the senses can never grasp
and yet the mind can be known and studied as truly and as scientifically as can the world of matter
let us first of all see how this can be done
how mind is to be known the personal character of mind can be observed and known
but each one can know directly only his own mind and not another
you and i may look into each other face and there guess the meaning that lies back of the smile or frown or flash of the eye and so read something of the mind activity
but neither directly meets the other mind
i may learn to recognize your features know your voice respond to the clasp of your hand but the mind the consciousness which does your thinking and feels your joys and sorrows i can never know completely
indeed i can never know your mind at all except through your bodily acts and expressions
nor is there any way in which you can reveal your mind your spiritual self to me except through these means
it follows therefore that only can ever know and only can ever know
between your consciousness and mine there exists a wide gap that can not be bridged
we are like ships that pass and hail each other in passing but do not touch
we may work together live together come to love or hate each other and yet our inmost selves forever stand alone
they must live their own lives think their own thoughts and arrive at their own destiny
introspection the only means of discovering nature of what then is mind
what is the thing that we call consciousness
no mere definition can ever make it clearer than it is at this moment to each of us
the only way to know what mind is is to look in upon our own consciousness and observe what is transpiring there
in the language of the psychologist we must
for one can never come to understand the nature of mind and its laws of working by listening to lectures or reading text books alone
there is no in the text but only in your living flowing stream of thought and mine
true the lecture and the book may tell us what to look for when we introspect and how to understand what we find
but the statements and descriptions about our minds must be verified by our own observation and experience before they become vital truth to us
how we introspection is something of an art it has to be learned
some master it easily some with more difficulty and some it is to be feared never become skilled in its use
in order to introspect one must catch himself unawares so to speak in the very act of thinking remembering deciding loving hating and all the rest
these fleeting phases of consciousness are ever on the wing they never pause in their restless flight and we must catch them as they go
this is not so easy as it appears for the moment we turn to look in upon the mind that moment consciousness changes
the thing we meant to examine is gone and something else has taken its place
all that is left us then is to view the mental object while it is still fresh in the memory or to catch it again when it returns
studying mental states of others through although i can meet only my own mind face to face i am nevertheless under the necessity of judging your mental states and knowing what is taking place in your consciousness
for in order to work successfully with you in order to teach you understand you control you or obey you be your friend or enemy or associate with you in any other way i must you
but the real you that i must know is hidden behind the physical mask that we call the body
i must therefore be able to understand your states of consciousness as they are reflected in your bodily expressions
your face form gesture speech the tone of voice laughter and tears the poise of attention the droop of grief the tenseness of anger and start of fear all these tell the story of the mental state that lies behind the senses
these various expressions are the pictures on the screen by which your mind reveals itself to others they are the language by which the inner self speaks to the world without
i would understand the workings of your mind i must therefore learn to read the language of physical expression
i must study human nature and learn to observe others
i must apply the information found in the texts to an interpretation of those about me
this study of others may be as in the mere intelligent observation of those i meet or it may be as when i conduct carefully planned psychological experiments
but in either case it consists in judging the inner states of consciousness by their physical manifestations
the three methods by which mind may be studied are then  and  of my own conscious processes and  of others either uncritical or scientific
the nature of consciousness inner nature of the mind not revealed by we are not to be too greatly discouraged if even by introspection we can not discover exactly
no one knows what electricity is though nearly everyone uses it in one form or another
we study the dynamo the motor and the conductors through which electricity manifests itself
we observe its effects in light heat and mechanical power and so learn the laws which govern its operations
but we are almost as far from understanding its true nature as were the ancients who knew nothing of its uses
the dynamo does not create the electricity but only furnishes the conditions which make it possible for electricity to manifest itself in doing the world work
likewise the brain or nervous system does not create the mind but it furnishes the machine through which the mind works
we may study the nervous system and learn something of the conditions and limitations under which the mind operates but this is not studying the mind itself
as in the case of electricity what we know about the mind we must learn through the activities in which it manifests itself these we can know for they are in the experience of all
it is then only by studying these processes of consciousness that we come to know the laws which govern the mind and its development
it is that thinks and feels and wills in us is too hard a problem for us here indeed has been too hard a problem for the philosophers through the ages
but the thinking and feeling and willing we can watch as they occur and hence come to know
consciousness as a process or in looking in upon the mind we must expect to discover then not a but a
the forever eludes us but the process is always present
consciousness is like a stream which so far as we are concerned with it in a psychological discussion has its rise at the cradle and its end at the grave
it begins with the babe first faint gropings after light in his new world as he enters it and ends with the man last blind gropings after light in his old world as he leaves it
the stream is very narrow at first only as wide as the few sensations which come to the babe when it sees the light or hears the sound it grows wider as the mind develops and is at last measured by the grand sum total of life experience
this mental stream is irresistible
no power outside of us can stop it while life lasts
when we try to stop thinking the stream but changes its direction and flows on
while we wake and while we sleep while we are unconscious under an an√¶sthetic even some sort of mental process continues
sometimes the stream flows slowly and our thoughts lag we feel slow again the stream flows faster and we are lively and our thoughts come with a rush or a fever seizes us and delirium comes on then the stream runs wildly onward defying our control and a mad jargon of thoughts takes the place of our usual orderly array
in different persons also the mental stream moves at different rates some minds being naturally and some naturally quick in their operations
consciousness resembles a stream also in other particulars
a stream is an unbroken whole from its source to its mouth and an observer stationed at one point can not see all of it at once
he sees but the one little section which happens to be passing his station point at the time
the current may look much the same from moment to moment but the component particles which constitute the stream are constantly changing
its stream is continuous from birth till death but we can not see any considerable portion of it at one time
when we turn about quickly and look in upon our minds we see but the little present moment
that of a few seconds ago is gone and will never return
the thought which occupied us a moment since can no more be recalled just as it was than can the particles composing a stream be and made to pass a given point in its course in precisely the same order and relation to one another as before
this means then that we can never have precisely the same mental state twice that the thought of the moment can not have the same associates that it had the first time that the thought of this moment will never be ours again that all we can know of our minds at any one time is the part of the process present in consciousness at that moment
the wave in the stream of the surface of our mental stream is not level but is broken by a wave which stands above the rest which is but another way of saying that some one thing is always more prominent in our thought than the rest
only when we are in a sleepy reverie or not thinking about much of anything does the stream approximate a level
at all other times some one object occupies the highest point in our thought to the more or less complete exclusion of other things which we might think about
a thousand and one objects are possible to our thought at any moment but all except one thing occupy a secondary place or are not present to our consciousness at all
they exist on the margin or else are clear off the edge of consciousness while the one thing occupies the center
we may be reading a fascinating book late at night in a cold room
the charm of the writer the beauty of the heroine or the bravery of the hero so occupies the mind that the weary eyes and chattering teeth are unnoticed
consciousness has piled up in a high wave on the points of interest in the book and the bodily sensations are for the moment on a much lower level
but let the book grow dull for a moment and the of the stream changes in a flash
hero heroine or literary style no longer occupies the wave
they forfeit their place the wave is taken by the bodily sensations and we are conscious of the smarting eyes and shivering body while these in turn give way to the next object which occupies the wave
consciousness likened to a the consciousness of any moment has been less happily likened to a field in the center of which there is an elevation higher than the surrounding level
this center is where consciousness is piled up on the object which is for the moment foremost in our thought
the other objects of our consciousness are on the margin of the field for the time being but any of them may the next moment claim the center and drive the former object to the margin or it may drop entirely out of consciousness
this moment a noble resolve may occupy the center of the field while a troublesome tooth begets sensations of discomfort which linger dimly on the outskirts of our consciousness but a shooting pain from the tooth or a random thought crossing the mind and lo
the tooth holds sway and the resolve dimly fades to the margin of our consciousness and is gone
the piling up of consciousness is this figure is not so true as the one which likens our mind to a stream with its ever onward current answering to the flow of our thought but whichever figure we employ the truth remains the same
our mental energy is always piled up higher at one point than at others
either because our interest leads us or because the will dictates the mind is withdrawn from the thousand and one things we might think about and directed to this one thing which for the time occupies chief place
in other words we for this piling up of consciousness is nothing after all but attention
we have seen that our mental life may be likened to a stream flowing now faster now slower ever shifting never ceasing
we have yet to inquire what constitutes the material of the stream or what is the stuff that makes up the current of our thought what is the of consciousness
the question can not be fully answered at this point but a general notion can be gained which will be of service
why we need let us first of all ask what mind is for why do animals including men have minds
the biologist would say in order that they may themselves to their environment
each individual from mollusc to man needs the amount and type of mind that serves to fit its possessor into its particular world of activity
too little mind leaves the animal helpless in the struggle for existence
on the other hand a mind far above its possessor station would prove useless if not a handicap a mollusc could not use the mind of a man
content of consciousness determined by how much mind does man need
what range and type of consciousness will best serve to adjust us to our world of opportunity and responsibility
our world hence our mind must be capable of gathering knowledge
second we must be able to its values and respond to the great motives for action arising from the emotions
third we must have the power to exert which is to say that we possess a to control our acts
these three sets of processes and we shall therefore expect to find making up the content of our mental stream
let us proceed at once to test our conclusion by introspection
if we are sitting at our study table puzzling over a difficult problem in geometry forms the wave in the stream of consciousness the center of the field
it is the chief thing in our thinking
the fringe of our consciousness is made up of various sensations of the light from the lamp the contact of our clothing the sounds going on in the next room some bit of memory seeking recognition a tramp thought which comes along and a dozen other experiences not strong enough to occupy the center of the field
but instead of the study table and the problem
give us a bright fireside an and nothing to do
if we are aged images from out the past will probably come thronging in and occupy the field to such extent that the fire burns low and the room grows cold but still the forms from the past hold sway
if we are young visions of the future may crowd everything else to the margin of the field while the castles in spain occupy the center
our memories may also be accompanied by emotions sorrow love anger hate envy joy
and indeed these emotions may so completely occupy the field that the images themselves are for the time driven to the margin and the mind is occupied with its sorrow its love or its joy
once more instead of the problem or the memories or the castles in spain give us the necessity of making some decision great or small where contending motives are pulling us now in this direction now in that so that the question finally has to be settled by a supreme effort summed up in the words
this is the struggle of the will which each one knows for himself for who has not had a raging battle of motives occupy the center of the field while all else even the sense of time place and existence gave way in the face of this conflict
this struggle continues until the decision is made when suddenly all the stress and strain drop out and other objects may again have place in consciousness
the three fundamental phases of thus we see that if we could cut the stream of consciousness across as we might cut a stream of water from bank to bank with a huge knife and then look at the section we should find very different constituents in the stream at different times
we should at one time find the mind manifesting itself in or the acts by which we gain our knowledge at another in or the acts of feeling at still another in or the act of the will
these processes would make up the stream or in other words these are the acts which the mind performs in doing its work
we should never find a time when the stream consists of but one of the processes or when all these modes of mental activity are not represented
they will be found in varying proportions now more of knowing now of feeling and now of willing but some of each is always present in our consciousness
the nature of these different elements in our mental stream their relation to each other and the manner in which they all work together in amazing perplexity yet in perfect harmony to produce the wonderful will constitute the we shall consider together in the pages which follow
where consciousness resides i the conscious self dwell somewhere in this body but where
when my finger tips touch the object i wish to examine i seem to be in them
when the brain grows weary from overstudy i seem to be in it
when the heart throbs the breath comes quick and the muscles grow tense from noble resolve or strong emotion i seem to be in them all
when filled with the buoyant life of vigorous youth every fiber and nerve is with health and enthusiasm i live in every part of my marvelous body
small wonder that the ancients located the soul at one time in the heart at another in the pineal gland of the brain and at another made it coextensive with the body
consciousness works through the nervous later science has taught that the resides in and works through the nervous system which has its central office in the
and the reason why seem to be in every part of my body is because the nervous system extends to every part carrying messages of sight or sound or touch to the brain and bearing in return orders for movements which set the feet or the fingers
this partnership between mind and body is very close
just how it happens that spirit may inhabit matter we may not know
but certain it is that they interact on each other
what will hinder the growth of one will handicap the other and what favors the development of either will help both
the methods of their co√∂peration and the laws that govern their relationship will develop as our study goes on
one should always keep in mind that psychology is essentially a laboratory science and not a subject
the laboratory material is to be found in ourselves and in those about us
while the text should be thoroughly mastered its statements should always be verified by reference to one own experience and observation of others
especially should prospective teachers constantly correlate the lessons of the book with the observation of children at work in the school
the problems suggested for observation and introspection will if mastered do much to render practical and helpful the truths of psychology
think of your home as you last left it
can you see vividly just how it looked the color of the paint on the outside with the familiar form of the roof and all can you recall the perfume in some old drawer the taste of a favorite dish the sound of a familiar voice in farewell
what illustrations have you observed where the mental content of the moment seemed chiefly knowledge process chiefly
feeling process chiefly or willing process
when you say that you remember a circumstance that occurred yesterday how do you remember it
that is do you see in your mind things just as they were and hear again sounds which occurred or feel again movements which you performed
do you experience once more the emotions you then felt
what forms of expression most commonly reveal what reveal emotions
can you tell what a child is by the expression on his face
can you tell whether he is by his face
is speech as necessary in expressing feeling as in expressing thought
try occasionally during the next hours to turn quickly about mentally and see whether you can observe your thinking feeling or willing in the very act of taking place
what becomes of our mind or consciousness while we are asleep
how are we able to wake up at a certain hour previously determined
can a person have absolutely in his mind
have you noticed any children especially adept in expression
have you noticed any very backward
if so in what form of expression in each case
have you observed any instances of expression which you were at a loss to interpret remember that expression includes every form of physical action voice speech face form hand etc
how do you rank in mental ability and how effective are your mind grasp and power
the answer that must be given to these questions will depend not more on your native endowment than on your skill in using attention
it is by attention that we gather and mass our mental energy upon the critical and important points in our thinking
in the last chapter we saw that consciousness is not distributed evenly over the whole field but piled up now on this object of thought now on that in obedience to interest or necessity
the concentration of the mind energy on one object of thought is attention
the nature of everyone knows what it is to attend
the story so fascinating that we can not leave it the critical points in a game the interesting sermon or lecture the sparkling conversation all these compel our attention
so completely is our mind energy centered on them and withdrawn from other things that we are scarcely aware of what is going on about us
we are also familiar with another kind of attention
for we all have read the dull story watched the slow game listened to the lecture or sermon that drags and taken part in conversation that was a bore
we gave these things our attention but only with effort
our mind energy seemed to center on anything rather than the matter in hand
a thousand objects from outside enticed us away and it required the frequent mental jerk to bring us to the subject in hand
and when brought back to our thought problem we felt the constant tug of mind to be free again
normal consciousness always in a state of but this very effort of the mind to free itself from one object of thought that it may busy itself with another is attention is solicited by this
some object in our field of consciousness is always exerting an appeal for attention and to attend
one thing is always to attend a multitude of other things upon which the thought might rest
we may therefore say that attention is constantly in our stream of thought those aspects that are to receive emphasis and consideration
from moment to moment it determines the points at which our mental energy shall be centered
the effects of attention attention makes its object clear and whatever attention centers upon stands out sharp and clear in consciousness
whether it be a bit of memory an a sensation from an aching tooth the reasoning on an algebraic formula a choice which we are making the setting of an emotion whatever be the object to which we are attending that object is illumined and made to stand out from its fellows as the one prominent thing in the mind eye while the attention rests on it
it is like the one building which the searchlight picks out among a city full of buildings and lights up while the remainder are left in the semilight or in darkness
attention measures mental in a state of attention the mind may be likened to the rays of the sun which have been passed through a burning glass
you may let all the rays which can pass through your window pane fall hour after hour upon the paper lying on your desk and no marked effects follow
but let the same amount of sunlight be passed through a lens and converged to a point the size of your pencil point and the paper will at once burst into flame
what the diffused rays could not do in hours or in ages is now accomplished in seconds
likewise the mind allowed to scatter over many objects can accomplish but little
we may sit and dream away an hour or a day over a page or a problem without securing results
but let us call in our wits from their and buckle down to it with all our might withdrawing our thoughts from everything else but this and concentrating our mind on it
more can now be accomplished in minutes than before in hours
nay which could not be accomplished at all now become possible
again the mind may be compared to a steam engine which is constructed to run at a certain pressure of steam say one hundred and fifty pounds to the square inch of boiler surface
once i ran such an engine and well i remember a morning during my early apprenticeship when the foreman called for power to run some of the lighter machinery while my steam gauge registered but pounds
surely i thought if one hundred and fifty pounds will run all this machinery pounds should run half of it so i opened the valve
but the powerful engine could do but little more than turn its own wheels and refused to do the required work
not until the pressure had risen above one hundred pounds could the engine perform half the work which it could at one hundred and fifty pounds
if it is meant to do its best work under a certain degree of concentration it can not in a given time do half the work with half the attention
further there will be much it can not do at unless working under full pressure
we shall not be overstating the case if we say that as attention increases in arithmetical ratio mental efficiency increases in geometrical ratio
it is in large measure a difference in the power of attention which makes one man a master in thought and achievement and another his humble follower
one often hears it said that genius is but the power of sustained attention and this statement possesses a large element of truth
how we attend someone has said that if our attention is properly trained we should be able to look at the point of a cambric needle for half an hour without winking
but this is a false idea of attention
the ability to look at the point of a cambric needle for half an hour might indicate a very laudable power of concentration but the process instead of enlightening us concerning the point of the needle would result in our passing into a hypnotic state
voluntary attention to any one object can be sustained for but a brief time a few seconds at best
it is essential that the object change that we turn it over and over incessantly and consider its various aspects and relations
sustained voluntary attention is thus a repetition of successive efforts to bring back the object to the mind
then the subject grows and develops it is living not dead
a relating when we are attending strongly to one object of thought it does not mean that consciousness sits staring vacantly at this one object but rather that it uses it as a central core of thought and thinks into relation with this object the things which belong with it
in working out some mathematical solution the central core is the principle upon which the solution is based and concentration in this case consists in thinking the various conditions of the problem in relation to this underlying principle
in the accompanying diagram fig  let a be the central core of some object of thought say a patch of cloud in a picture and let be the related facts or the shape size color of the cloud
the arrows indicate the passing of our thought from cloud to related fact or from related fact to cloud and from related fact to related fact
as long as these related facts lead back to the cloud each time that long we are attending to the cloud and thinking about it
it is when our thought fails to go back that we wander in our attention
then we leave which are related to the cloud and flying off to and finally bring up heaven knows where
illustration fig  the rhythms of attention works in rhythms
this is to say that it never maintains a constant level of concentration for any considerable length of time but regularly ebbs and flows
the explanation of this rhythmic action would take us too far afield at this point
when we remember however that our entire organism works within a great system of rhythms hunger thirst sleep fatigue and many others it is easy to see that the same law may apply to attention
the rhythms of attention vary greatly the fluctuations often being only a few seconds apart for certain simple sensations and probably a much greater distance apart for the more complex process of thinking
the seeming variation in the sound of a distant waterfall now loud and now faint is caused by the rhythm of attention and easily allows us to measure the rhythm for this particular sensation
points of failure in attention lack of there are two chief types of inattention whose danger threatens every person
we may be thinking about the right things but not thinking enough
outside thoughts which have no relation to the subject in hand may not trouble us much but we do not attack our problem with vim
the current in our stream of consciousness is moving too slowly
we do not gather up all our mental forces and mass them on the subject before us in a way that means victory
our thoughts may be sufficiently focused but they fail to set fire
it is like focusing the sun rays while an eclipse is on
they will not kindle the paper after they have passed through the lens
this kind of attention means mental dawdling
for the individual it means defeat in life battles for the nation it means mediocrity and stagnation
a college professor said to his faithful but poorly prepared class judging from your worn and tired appearance young people you are putting in twice too many hours on study
at this commendation the class brightened up visibly
but he continued judging from your preparation you do not study quite half hard enough
happy is the student who starting in on his lesson rested and fresh can study with such concentration that an hour of steady application will leave him mentally exhausted and limp
that is one hour of triumph for him no matter what else he may have accomplished or failed to accomplish during the time
he can afford an occasional pause for rest for difficulties will melt rapidly away before him
he possesses one key to successful achievement
mental we may have good mental power and be able to think hard and efficiently on any one point but lack the power to think in a straight line
every stray thought that comes along is a to lead us away from the subject in hand and into lines of thought not relating to it
who has not started in to think on some problem and after a few moments been surprised to find himself miles away from the topic upon which he started
or who has not read down a page and turning to the next found that he did not know a word on the preceding page his thoughts having wandered away his eyes only going through the process of reading
instead of sticking to the of our topic and relating them all up to a thereby reaching a solution of the problem we often jump at once to and find ourselves far afield with all possibility of a solution gone
we may have brilliant thoughts about but they are not related to anything in particular and so they pass from us and are gone lost in oblivion because they are not attached to something permanent
such a thinker is at the mercy of circumstances following blindly the leadings of trains of thought which are his master instead of his servant and which lead him anywhere or nowhere without let or hindrance from him
his consciousness moves rapidly enough and with enough force but it is like a ship without a helm
starting for the intellectual port
he is mentally shipwrecked at last on the rocks and never reaches harbor
fortunate is he who can shut out intruding thoughts and think in a straight line
even with mediocre ability he may accomplish more by his thinking than the brilliant thinker who is constantly having his mental train wrecked by stray thoughts which slip in on his right of way
types of attention the three types of attention may be secured in three ways  it is demanded by some sudden or intense sensory stimulus or insistent idea or  it follows interest or  it is compelled by the will
if it comes in the first way as from a thunderclap or a flash of light or from the persistent attempt of some unsought idea to secure entrance into the mind it is called attention
this form of attention is of so little importance comparatively in our mental life that we shall not discuss it further
if attention comes in the second way following interest it is called or spontaneous attention if in the third compelled by the will or active attention
nonvoluntary attention has its motive in some object external to consciousness or else follows a more or less uncontrolled current of thought which interests us voluntary attention is controlled from within decide what we shall attend to instead of letting interesting objects of thought determine it for us
interest and nonvoluntary in nonvoluntary attention the environment largely determines what we shall attend to
all that we have to do with directing this kind of attention is in developing certain lines of interest and then the interesting things attract attention
the things we see and hear and touch and taste and smell the things we like the things we do and hope to do these are the determining factors in our mental life so long as we are giving nonvoluntary attention
our attention follows the beckoning of these things as the needle the magnet
it is no effort to attend to them but rather the effort would be to keep from attending to them
who does not remember reading a story perhaps a forbidden one so interesting that when mother called up the stairs for us to come down to attend to some duty we replied yes in a minute and then went on reading
we simply could not stop at that place
the minute lengthens into ten and another call startles us
yes i coming we turn just one more leaf and are lost again
at last comes a third call in tones so imperative that it can not be longer ignored and we lay the book down but open to the place where we left off and where we hope soon to begin further to unravel the delightful mystery
was it an effort to attend to the reading
it took the combined force of our will and of mother authority to drag the attention away
left to itself then attention simply obeys natural laws and follows the line of least resistance
by far the larger portion of our attention is of this type
thought often runs on hour after hour when we are not conscious of effort or struggle to compel us to cease thinking about this thing and begin thinking about that
indeed it may be doubted whether this is not the case with some persons for days at a time instead of hours
the things that present themselves to the mind are the things which occupy it the character of the thought is determined by the character of our interests
it is this fact which makes it vitally necessary that our interests shall be broad and pure if our thoughts are to be of this type
it is not enough that we have the strength to drive from our minds a wrong or impure thought which seeks entrance
to stand guard as a policeman over our thoughts to see that no unworthy one enters requires too much time and energy
our interests must be of such a nature as to lead us away from the field of unworthy thoughts if we are to be free from their tyranny
the will and voluntary in voluntary attention there is a conflict either between the will and interest or between the will and the mental inertia or laziness which has to be overcome before we can think with any degree of concentration
interest says follow this line which is easy and attractive or which requires but little effort follow the line of least resistance
will says quit that line of dalliance and ease and take this harder way which i direct cease the line of least resistance and take the one of greatest resistance
when day dreams and castles in spain attempt to lure you from your lessons refuse to follow shut out these vagabond thoughts and stick to your task
when intellectual inertia deadens your thought and clogs your mental stream throw it off and court forceful effort
if wrong or impure thoughts seek entrance to your mind close and lock your mental doors to them
if thoughts of desire try to drive out thoughts of duty be heroic and insist that thoughts of duty shall have right of way
in short see that are the master of your thinking and do not let it always be directed without your consent by influences outside of yourself
it is just at this point that the strong will wins victory and the weak will breaks down
between the ability to control one thoughts and the inability to control them lies all the difference between right actions and wrong actions between withstanding temptation and yielding to it between an inefficient purposeless life and a life of purpose and endeavor between success and failure
for we act in accordance with those things which our thought rests upon
suppose two lines of thought represented by
and respectively lie before you that
leads to a course of action difficult or unpleasant but necessary to success or duty and that leads to a course of action easy or pleasant but fatal to success or duty
which course will you follow the rugged path of duty or the easier one of pleasure
the answer depends almost wholly if not entirely on your power of attention
if your will is strong enough to pull your thoughts away from the fatal but attractive and hold them resolutely on the less attractive
will dictate your course of action and you will respond to the call for endeavor and duty but if your thoughts break away from the domination of your will and allow the beckoning of your interests alone then will dictate your course of action and you will follow the leading of ease and pleasure
for our actions are finally and irrevocably dictated by the things we think
not really different kinds of it is not to be understood however from what has been said that there are
all attention denotes an active or dynamic phase of consciousness
the difference is rather the way we secure whether it is demanded by sudden stimulus coaxed from us by interesting objects of thought without effort on our part or compelled by force of will to desert the more interesting and take the direction which we dictate
improving the power of attention
while attention is no doubt partly a natural gift yet there is probably no power of the mind more susceptible to training than is attention
and with attention as with every other power of body and mind the secret of its development lies in its use
stated briefly the only way to train attention is by attending
no amount of theorizing or resolving can take the place of practice in the actual process of attending
making different kinds of attention re√´nforce each a very close relationship and interdependence exists between nonvoluntary and voluntary attention
it would be impossible to hold our attention by sheer force of will on objects which were forever devoid of interest likewise the blind following of our interests and desires would finally lead to shipwreck in all our lives
each kind of attention must support and re√´nforce the other
the lessons the sermons the lectures and the books in which we are most interested and hence to which we attend nonvoluntarily and with the least effort and fatigue are the ones out of which other things being equal we get the most and remember the best and longest
on the other hand there are sometimes lessons and lectures and books and many things besides which are not intensely interesting but which should be attended to nevertheless
it is at this point that the will must step in and take command
if it has not the strength to do this it is in so far a weak will and steps should be taken to develop it
we are to the faculty of effort alive in us by a little gratuitous exercise every
we are to be systematically heroic in the little points of everyday life and experience
we are not to shrink from tasks because they are difficult or unpleasant
then when the test comes we shall not find ourselves unnerved and untrained but shall be able to stand in the evil day
the habit of finally one of the chief things in training the attention is form the habit of
this habit is to be formed only by
whenever and wherever the proper thing to do is to attend whether in work in play in making fishing flies in preparing for an examination in courting a sweetheart in reading a book
the lesson or the sermon or the lecture may not be very interesting but if they are to be attended to at all our rule should be to attend to them completely and absolutely
not by fits and starts now drifting away and now jerking ourselves back but the
and furthermore the one who will deliberately do this will often find the dull and uninteresting task become more interesting but if it never becomes interesting he is at least forming a habit which will be invaluable to him through life
on the other hand the one who fails to attend except when his interest is captured who never exerts effort to compel attention is forming a habit which will be the bane of his thinking until his stream of thought shall end
which fatigues you more to give attention of the nonvoluntary type or the voluntary
which is the more pleasant and agreeable to give
under which can you accomplish more
what bearing have these facts on teaching
try to follow for one or two minutes the wave in your consciousness and then describe the course taken by your attention
have you observed one class alert in attention and another lifeless and inattentive
can you explain the causes lying back of this difference
estimate the relative amount of work accomplished under the two conditions
what distractions have you observed in the schoolroom tending to break up attention
have you seen pupils inattentive from lack of  change  pure air  enthusiasm on the part of the teacher  fatigue  ill health
have you noticed a difference in the of attention in different pupils
have you noticed the same thing for whole schools or rooms
do you know of children too much given to daydreaming
have you seen a teacher rap the desk for attention
what type of attention was secured
have you observed any instance in which pupils ' lack of attention should be blamed on the teacher
visit a school room or a recitation and then write an account of the types and degrees of attention you observed
try to explain the factors responsible for any failures in attention and also those responsible for the good attention shown
chapter iii the brain and nervous system a fine brain or a good mind
these terms are often used interchangeably as if they stood for the same thing
yet the brain is material substance so many cells and fibers a pulpy protoplasmic mass weighing some three pounds and shut away from the outside world in a casket of bone
the mind is a spiritual thing the sum of the processes by which we think and feel and will mastering our world and accomplishing our destiny
the relations of mind and brain interaction of mind and how then come these two widely different facts mind and brain to be so related in our speech
why are the terms so commonly interchanged it is because mind and brain are so vitally related in their processes and so inseparably connected in their work
no movement of our thought no bit of sensation no memory no feeling no act of decision but is accompanied by its own particular activity in the cells of the brain
it is this that the psychologist has in mind when he says psychosis without its corresponding
so far as our present existence is concerned then no mind ever works except through some brain and a brain without a mind becomes but a mass of dead matter so much clay
mind and brain are perfectly adapted to each other
for through the ages of man past history each has grown up and developed into its present state of efficiency by working in conjunction with the other
each has helped form the other and determine its qualities
not only is this true for the race in its evolution but for every individual as he passes from infancy to maturity
the brain as the mind in the first chapter we saw that the brain does not create the mind but that the mind works through the brain
no one can believe that the brain secretes mind as the liver secretes bile or that it grinds it out as a mill does flour
indeed just what their exact relation is has not yet been settled
yet it is easy to see that if the mind must use the brain as a machine and work through it then the mind must be subject to the limitations of its machine or in other words the mind can not be better than the brain through which it operates
a brain and nervous system that are poorly developed or insufficiently nourished mean low grade of efficiency in our mental processes just as a poorly constructed or wrongly adjusted motor means loss of power in applying the electric current to its work
we will then look upon the mind and the brain as counterparts of each other each performing activities which correspond to activities in the other both inextricably bound together at least so far as this life is concerned and each getting its significance by its union with the other
this view will lend interest to a brief study of the brain and nervous system
the mind dependence on the external world
but can we first see how in a general way the brain and nervous system are primarily related to our thinking
let us go back to the beginning and consider the babe when it first opens its eyes on the scenes of its new existence
imagine if you can a person born blind and deaf and without the sense of touch taste or smell
let such a person live on for a year for five years for a lifetime
what ray of intelligence would enter his mind
all would be dark to his eyes all silent to his ears all tasteless to his mouth all odorless to his nostrils all touchless to his skin
he could not get started to think
he could not get started to act
he would belong to a lower scale of life than the tiny animal that floats with the waves and the tide in the ocean without power to direct its own course
he would be but an inert mass of flesh without sense or intelligence
this is the condition of the babe at birth
it is born practically blind and deaf without definite sense of taste or smell
born without anything to think about and no way to get anything to think about until the senses wake up and furnish some material from the outside world
born with all the mechanism of muscle and nerve ready to perform the countless complex movements of arms and legs and body which characterize every child he could not successfully start these activities without a message from the senses to set them going
at birth the child probably has only the senses of contact and temperature present with any degree of clearness taste soon follows vision of an imperfect sort in a few days hearing about the same time and smell a little later
the senses are waking up and beginning their acquaintance with the outside world
a neurone from a human spinal cord
the central portion represents the cell body
n the nucleus p a pigmented or colored spot d a dendrite or relatively short fiber which branches freely a an axon or long fiber which branches but little
the work of the and what a problem the senses have to solve
on the one hand the great universe of sights and sounds of tastes and smells of contacts and temperatures and whatever else may belong to the material world in which we live and on the other hand the little shapeless mass of gray and white pulpy matter called the brain incapable of sustaining its own shape shut away in the darkness of a bony case with no possibility of contact with the outside world and possessing no means of communicating with it except through the senses
and yet this universe of external things must be brought into communication with the seemingly insignificant but really wonderful brain else the mind could never be
here we discover then the two great factors which first require our study if we would understand the growth of the mind material world without and the brain
for it is the action and interaction of these which lie at the bottom of the mind development
let us first look a little more closely at the brain and the accompanying nervous system
structural elements of the nervous system it will help in understanding both the structure and the working of the nervous system to keep in mind that it contains one fundamental unit of
just as the house is built up by adding brick upon brick so brain cord nerves and organs of sense are formed by the union of numberless neurones
neurones in different stages of development from to
in the elementary cell body alone is present in a dendrite is shown projecting upward and an axon after donaldson
what is its structure its function how does it act
a neurone is protoplasmic cell with its outgrowing
the cell part of the neurone is of a variety of shapes triangular pyramidal cylindrical and irregular
the cells vary in size from to of an inch in diameter
in general the function of the cell is thought to be to generate the nervous energy responsible for our consciousness sensation memory reasoning feeling and all the rest and for our movements
the cell also provides for the nutrition of the fibers
longitudinal a and transverse b section of nerve fiber
the heavy border represents the medullary or enveloping sheath which becomes thicker in the larger after donaldson
neurone the neurone fibers are of two kinds and
the dendrites are comparatively large in diameter branch freely like the branches of a tree and extend but a relatively short distance from the parent cell
axons are slender and branch but little and then approximately at right angles
they reach a much greater distance from the cell body than the dendrites
neurones vary greatly in length
some of those found in the spinal cord and brain are not more than of an inch long while others which reach from the extremities to the cord measure several feet
both dendrites and axons are of diameter so small as to be invisible except under the microscope
out of this simple structural element the neurone the entire nervous system is built
true the neurones are held in place and perhaps insulated by a kind of soft cement called
but this seems to possess no strictly nervous function
the number of the microscopic neurones required to make up the mass of the brain cord and peripheral nervous system is far beyond our mental grasp
it is computed that the brain and cord contain some millions of them
complexity of the something of the complexity of the brain structure can best be understood by an illustration
professor stratton estimates that if we were to make a model of the human brain using for the neurone fibers wires so small as to be barely visible to the eye in order to find room for all the wires the model would need to be the size of a city block on the base and correspondingly high
imagine a telephone system of this complexity operating from one
gray and white the gray matter of the brain and cord is made up of nerve cells and their dendrites and the terminations of axons which enter from the adjoining white matter
a part of the mass of gray matter also consists of the neuroglia which surrounds the nerve cells and fibers and a network of blood vessels
the white matter of the central system consists chiefly of axons with their enveloping or medullary sheath and neuroglia
the white matter contains no nerve cells or dendrites
the difference in color of the gray and the white matter is caused chiefly by the fact that in the gray masses the medullary sheath which is white is lacking thus revealing the ashen gray of the nerve threads
in the white masses the medullary sheath is present
gross structure of the nervous system divisions of the nervous the nervous system may be considered in two divisions  the system which consists of the brain and spinal cord and  the system which comprises the sensory and motor neurones connecting the periphery and the internal organs with the central system and the specialized of the senses
the system which is found as a double chain of nerve connections joining the roots of sensory and motor nerves just outside the spinal column does not seem to be directly related to consciousness and so will not be discussed here
a brief description of the nervous system will help us better to understand how its parts all work together in so wonderful a way to accomplish their great result
the central in the brain we easily distinguish three major divisions the the and the
the medulla is but the enlarged upper part of the cord where it connects with the brain
it is about an inch and a quarter long and is composed of both medullated and unmedullated fibers that is of both white and gray matter
in the medulla the unmedullated neurones which comprise the center of the cord are passing to the outside and the medullated to the inside thus taking the positions they occupy in the cerebrum
here also the neurones are crossing or changing sides so that those which pass up the right side of the cord finally connect with the left side of the brain and vice versa
the lying just back of the medulla and at the rear part of the base of the cerebrum is the cerebellum or little brain approximately as large as the fist and composed of a complex arrangement of white and gray matter
fibers from the spinal cord enter this mass and others emerge and pass on into the cerebrum while its two halves also are connected with each other by means of cross fibers
illustration fig view of the under side of the brain
b basis of the crura p pons mo medulla oblongata ce cerebellum sc spinal cord
the the cerebrum occupies all the upper part of the skull from the front to the rear
it is divided symmetrically into two hemispheres the right and the left
these hemispheres are connected with each other by a small bridge of fibers called the
each hemisphere is furrowed and ridged with convolutions an arrangement which allows greater surface for the distribution of the gray cellular matter over it
besides these irregularities of surface each hemisphere is marked also by two deep clefts or
the fissure of rolando extending from the middle upper part of the hemisphere downward and forward passing a little in front of the ear and stopping on a level with the upper part of it and the fissure of sylvius beginning at the base of the brain somewhat in front of the ear and extending upward and backward at an acute angle with the base of the hemisphere

the surface of each hemisphere may be thought of as mapped out into four lobes the frontal lobe which includes the front part of the hemisphere and extends back to the fissure of rolando and down to the fissure of sylvius the parietal lobe which lies back of the fissure of rolando and above that of sylvius and extends back to the occipital lobe the occipital lobe which includes the extreme rear portion of the hemisphere and the temporal lobe which lies below the fissure of sylvius and extends back to the occipital lobe
the the gray matter of the hemispheres unlike that of the cord lies on the surface
this gray exterior portion of the cerebrum is called the and varies from to of an inch in thickness
the cortex is the seat of all consciousness and of the control of voluntary movement
different aspects of sections of the spinal cord and of the roots of the spinal nerves from the cervical region  different views of anterior median fissure  posterior fissure  anterior lateral depression for anterior roots  posterior lateral depression for posterior roots  and  anterior and posterior roots respectively  complete spinal nerve formed by the union of the anterior and posterior roots
the spinal the spinal cord proceeds from the base of the brain downward about eighteen inches through a canal provided for it in the vertebr√¶ of the spinal column
it is composed of white matter on the outside and gray matter within
a deep fissure on the anterior side and another on the posterior cleave the cord nearly in twain resembling the brain in this particular
the gray matter on the interior is in the form of two crescents connected by a narrow bar
the nervous system consists of pairs of with their branching off from the cord and twelve pairs that have their roots in the brain
branches of these pairs of nerves reach to every part of the periphery of the body and to all the internal organs
the projection fibers of the brain
the first nine pairs of cranial nerves
it will help in understanding the peripheral system to remember that a consists of a bundle of neurone fibers each wrapped in its medullary sheath and sheath of schwann
around this bundle of neurones that is around the nerve is still another wrapping called the neurilemma
the number of fibers going to make up a nerve varies from about to
nerves can easily be identified in a piece of lean beef or even at the edge of a serious gash in one own flesh
bundles of sensory fibers constituting a sensory nerve root enter the spinal cord on the posterior side through holes in the vertebr√¶
similar bundles of motor fibers in the form of a motor nerve root emerge from the cord at the same level
soon after their emergence from the cord these two nerves are wrapped together in the same sheath and proceed in this way to the periphery of the body where the sensory nerve usually ends in a specialized fitted to respond to some certain stimulus from the outside world
the motor nerve ends in minute filaments in the muscular organ which it governs
both sensory and motor nerves connect with fibers of like kind in the cord and these in turn with the cortex thus giving every part of the periphery direct connection with the cortex
schematic diagram showing association fibers connecting cortical centers with each after james and starr
the of the sensory nerves are nerve masses some of them as the taste buds of the tongue relatively simple and others as the eye or ear very complex
they are all alike in one particular namely that each is fitted for its own particular work and can do no other
thus the eye is the of sight and is a wonderfully complex arrangement of nerve structure combined with refracting media and arranged to respond to the rapid ether waves of light
the ear has for its essential part the specialized endings of the auditory nerve and is fitted to respond to the waves carried to it in the air giving the sensation of sound
the of touch found in greatest perfection in the finger tips are of several kinds all very complicated in structure
and so on with each of the senses
each particular sense has some form of specially adapted to respond to the kind of stimulus upon which its sensation depends and each is insensible to the stimuli of the others much as the receiver of a telephone will respond to the tones of our voice but not to the touch of our fingers as will the telegraph instrument and
thus the eye is not affected by sounds nor touch by light
yet by means of all the senses together we are able to come in contact with the material world in a variety of ways
localization of function in the nervous system division of division of labor is the law in the organic world as in the industrial
animals of the lowest type such as the amoeba do not have separate organs for respiration digestion assimilation elimination the one tissue performing all of these functions
but in the higher forms each organ not only has its own specific work but even within the same organ each part has its own particular function assigned
thus we have seen that the two parts of the neurone probably perform different functions the cells generating energy and the fibers transmitting it
it will not seem strange then that there is also a division of labor in the cellular matter itself in the nervous system
for example the little masses of ganglia which are distributed at intervals along the nerves are probably for the purpose of re√´nforcing the nerve current much as the battery cells in the local telegraph office re√´nforce the current from the central office
the cellular matter in the spinal cord and lower parts of the brain has a very important work to perform in receiving messages from the senses and responding to them in directing the simpler reflex acts and movements which we learn to execute without our consciousness being called upon thus leaving the mind free from these petty things to busy itself in higher ways
the cellular matter of the cortex performs the highest functions of all for through its activity we have consciousness
side view of left hemisphere of human brain showing the principal localized areas
the gray matter of the cerebellum the medulla and the cord may receive impressions from the senses and respond to them with movements but their response is in all cases wholly automatic and unconscious
a person whose hemispheres had been injured in such a way as to interfere with the activity of the cortex might still continue to perform most if not all of the habitual movements of his life but they would be mechanical and not intelligent
he would lack all higher consciousness
it is through the activity of this thin covering of cellular matter of the cerebrum the that our minds operate here are received stimuli from the different senses and here sensations are experienced
here all our movements which are consciously directed have their origin
and here all our thinking feeling and willing are done
division of labor in the nor does the division of labor in the nervous system end with this assignment of work
the cortex itself probably works essentially as a unit yet it is through a shifting of tensions from one area to another that it acts now giving us a sensation now directing a movement and now thinking a thought or feeling an emotion
localization of function is the rule here also
certain areas of the cortex are devoted chiefly to sensations others to motor impulses and others to higher thought activities yet in such a way that all work together in perfect harmony each re√´nforcing the other and making its work significant
thus the front portion of the cortex seems to be devoted to the higher thought activities the region on both sides of the fissure of rolando to motor activities and the rear and lower parts to sensory activities and all are bound together and made to work together by the association fibers of the brain
in the case of the higher thought activities it is not probable that one section of the frontal lobes of the cortex is set apart for thinking one for feeling and one for willing but rather that the whole frontal part of the cortex is concerned in each
in the motor and sensory areas however the case is different for here a still further division of labor occurs
for example in the motor region one small area seems connected with movements of the head one with the arm one with the leg one with the face and another with the organs of speech likewise in the sensory region one area is devoted to vision one to hearing one to taste and smell and one to touch etc
we must bear in mind however that these regions are not mapped out as accurately as are the boundaries of our states that no part of the brain is restricted wholly to either sensory or motor nerves and that no part works by itself independently of the rest of the brain
we name a tract from the predominance of nerves which end there or from the chief functions which the area performs
the motor localization seems to be the most perfect
indeed experimentation on the brains of monkeys has been successful in mapping out motor areas so accurately that such small centers as those connected with the bending of one particular leg or the flexing of a thumb have been located
yet each area of the cortex is so connected with every other area by the millions of association fibers that the whole brain is capable of working together as a unit thus unifying and harmonizing our thoughts emotions and acts
forms of sensory stimuli let us next inquire how this mechanism of the nervous system is acted upon in such a way as to give us sensations
in order to understand this we must first know that all forms of matter are composed of minute atoms which are in constant motion and by imparting this motion to the air or the ether which surrounds them are constantly radiating energy in the form of minute waves throughout space
these waves or radiations are incredibly rapid in some instances and rather slow in others
in sending out its energy in the form of these waves the physical world is doing its part to permit us to form its acquaintance
the of the sensory nerves must meet this advance and be so constructed as to be affected by the different forms of energy which are constantly beating upon them
the prism analysis of a bundle of light rays
on the right are shown the relation of vibration rates to temperature stimuli to light and to chemical stimuli
the rates are given in billions per after witmer
the and their response to thus the radiations of ether from the sun our chief source of light are so rapid that billions of them enter the eye in a second of time and the retina is of such a nature that its nerve cells are thrown into activity by these waves the impulse is carried over the optic nerve to the occipital lobe of the cortex and the sensation of sight is the result
the different colors also from the red of the spectrum to the violet are the result of different vibration rates in the waves of ether which strike the retina and in order to perceive color the retina must be able to respond to the particular vibration rate which represents each color
likewise in the sense of touch the are fitted to respond to very rapid vibrations and it is possible that the different qualities of touch are produced by different vibration rates in the atoms of the object we are touching
when we reach the ear we have the organ which responds to the lowest vibration rate of all for we can detect a sound made by an object which is vibrating from twenty to thirty times a second
the highest vibration rate which will affect the ear is some forty thousand per second
thus it is seen that there are great gaps in the different rates to which our senses are fitted to respond a sudden drop from billions in the case of the eye to millions in touch and to thousands or even tens in hearing
this makes one wonder whether there are not many things in nature which man has never discovered simply because he has not the sense mechanism enabling him to become conscious of their existence
there are undoubtedly more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy
dependence of the mind on the only as the senses bring in the material has the mind anything with which to build
thus have the senses to act as messengers between the great outside world and the brain to be the servants who shall stand at the doorways of the body the eyes the ears the finger tips each ready to receive its particular kind of impulse from nature and send it along the right path to the part of the cortex where it belongs so that the mind can say a sight a sound or a touch
thus does the mind come to know the universe of the senses
thus does it get the material out of which memory imagination and thought begin
thus and only thus does the mind secure the crude material from which the finished superstructure is finally built
chapter iv mental development and motor training education was long looked upon as affecting the mind only the body was either left out of account or neglected
later science has shown however that the mind can not be trained as the nervous system is trained and
for not sensation and the simpler mental processes alone but memory imagination judgment reasoning and every other act of the mind are dependent on the nervous system finally for their efficiency
the little child gets its first mental experiences in connection with certain movements or acts set up reflexly by the nervous system
from this time on movement and idea are so inextricably bound together that they can not be separated
the mind and the brain are so vitally related that it is impossible to educate one without performing a like office for the other and it is likewise impossible to neglect the one without causing the other to suffer in its development
factors determining the efficiency of the nervous system development and ignoring the native differences in nervous systems through the influence of heredity the efficiency of a nervous system is largely dependent on two factors  the development of the cells and fibers of which it is composed and  its general tone of health and vigor
the actual number of cells in the nervous system increases but little if at all after birth
indeed it is doubtful whether edison brain and nervous system has a greater number of cells in it than yours or mine
the difference between the brain of a genius and that of an ordinary man is not in the of cells which it contains but rather in the development of the cells and fibers which are present potentially at least in every nervous system
the histologist tells us that in the nervous system of every child there are tens of thousands of cells which are so immature and undeveloped that they are useless indeed this is the case to some degree in every adult person nervous system as well
thus each individual has inherent in his nervous system potentialities of which he has never taken advantage the utilizing of which may make him a genius and the neglecting of which will certainly leave him on the plane of mediocrity
the first problem in education then is to take the unripe and inefficient nervous system and so develop it in connection with the growing mind that the possibilities which nature has stored in it shall become actualities
undeveloped professor donaldson tells us on this point that at birth and for a long time after many nervous systems contain cell elements which are more or less immature not forming a functional part of the tissue and yet under some conditions capable of further development
for the cells which are continually appearing in the developing cortex no other source is known than the nuclei or granules found there in its earliest stages
these elements are metamorphosed neuroblasts that is elementary cells out of which the nervous matter is developed which have shrunken to a volume less than that which they had at first and which remain small until in the subsequent process of enlargement necessary for their full development they expand into cells
elements intermediate between these granules and the fully developed cells are always found even in mature brains and therefore it is inferred that the latter are derived from the former
the appearances there also lead to the conclusion that many elements which might possibly develop in any given case are far beyond the number that actually does so
the possible number of cells latent and functional in the central system is early fixed
at any age this number is accordingly represented by the granules as well as by the cells which have already undergone further development
during growth the proportion of developed cells increases and sometimes owing to the failure to recognize potential nerve cells in the granules the impression is carried away that this increase implies the formation of new elements
as has been shown such is not the case
development of nerve the nerve no less than the cells must go through a process of development
it has already been shown that the fibers are the result of a branching of cells
at birth many of the cells have not yet thrown out branches and hence the fibers are lacking while many of those which are already grown out are not sufficiently developed to transmit impulses accurately
thus it has been found that most children at birth are able to support the weight of the body for several seconds by clasping the fingers around a small rod but it takes about a year for the child to become able to stand
it is evident that it requires more actual strength to cling to a rod than to stand hence the conclusion is that the difference is in the earlier development of the nerve centers which have to do with clasping than of those concerned in standing
likewise the child first attempts to feed himself or do any one of the thousand little things about which he is so awkward are partial failures not so much because he has not had practice as because his nervous machinery connected with those movements is not yet developed sufficiently to enable him to be accurate
his brain is in a condition which flechsig calls unripe
how then shall the undeveloped cells and system ripen
how shall the undeveloped cells and fibers grow to full maturity and efficiency
development of nervous system through use importance of stimulus and like all other tissues of the body the nerve cells and fibers are developed by judicious use
the sensory and association centers require the constant stimulus of nerve currents running in from the various and the motor centers require the constant stimulus of currents running from them out to the muscles
in other words the conditions upon which both motor and sensory development depend are  a rich environment of sights and sounds and tastes and smells and everything else which serves as proper stimulus to the sense organs and to every form of intellectual and social interest and  no less important an opportunity for the freest and most complete forms of response and motor activity

an illustration of the effects of the lack of sensory stimuli on the cortex is well shown in the case of laura bridgman whose brain was studied by professor donaldson after her death
laura bridgman was born a normal child and developed as other children do up to the age of nearly three years
at this time through an attack of scarlet fever she lost her hearing completely and also the sight of her left eye
her right eye was so badly affected that she could see but little and it too became entirely blind when she was eight
she lived in this condition until she was sixty years old when she died
professor donaldson submitted the cortex of her brain to a most careful examination also comparing the corresponding areas on the two hemispheres with each other
he found that as a whole the cortex was thinner than in the case of normal individuals
he found also that the cortical area connected with the left eye namely the right occipital region was much thinner than that for the right eye which had retained its sight longer than the other
he says it is interesting to notice that those parts of the cortex which according to the current view were associated with the defective sense organs were also particularly thin
the cause of this thinness was found to be due at least in part to the small size of the nerve cells there present
not only were the large and cells smaller but the impression made on the observer was that they were also less numerous than in the normal cortex effect of sensory
no doubt if we could examine the brain of a person who has grown up in an environment rich in stimuli to the eye where nature earth and sky have presented a changing panorama of color and form to attract the eye where all the sounds of nature from the chirp of the insect to the roar of the waves and the murmur of the breeze and from the softest tones of the voice to the mightiest sweep of the great orchestra have challenged the ear where many and varied odors and perfumes have assailed the nostrils where a great range of tastes have tempted the palate where many varieties of touch and temperature sensations have been experienced no doubt if we could examine such a brain we should find the sensory areas of the cortex excelling in thickness because its cells were well developed and full sized from the currents which had been pouring into them from the outside world
on the other hand if we could examine a cortex which had lacked any one of these stimuli we should find some area in it undeveloped because of this deficiency
its owner therefore possesses but the fraction of a brain and would in a corresponding degree find his mind incomplete
necessity for motor likewise in the case of the motor areas
pity the boy or girl who has been deprived of the opportunity to use every muscle to the fullest extent in the unrestricted plays and games of childhood
for where such activities are not wide in their scope there some areas of the cortex will remain undeveloped because unused and the person will be handicapped later in his life from lack of skill in the activities depending on these centers
halleck says in this connection if we could examine the developing motor region with a microscope of sufficient magnifying power it is conceivable that we might learn wherein the modification due to exercise consists
we might also under such conditions be able to say is the motor region of a piano player the modifications here correspond precisely to those necessary for controlling such movements of the hand '
or is the motor tract of a blacksmith this of an engraver and these must be the cells which govern the vocal organs of an orator '
whether or not the microscope will ever reveal such things to us there is no doubt that the conditions suggested exist and that back of every inefficient and awkward attempt at physical control lies a motor area with its cells undeveloped by use
no wonder that our processes of learning physical adjustment and control are slow for they are a growth in the brain rather than a simple learning how
the training of the nervous system consists finally then in the development and co√∂rdination of the neurones of which it is composed
we have seen that the sensory cells are to be developed by the sensory stimuli pouring in upon them and the motor cells by the motor impulses which they send out to the muscles
the sensory and the motor fibers likewise being an outgrowth of their respective cells find their development in carrying the impulses which result in sensation and movement
thus it is seen that the neurone is in its development as in its work a unit
development of the association to this simpler type of sensory and motor development which we have been considering we must add that which comes from the more complex mental processes such as memory thought and imagination
for it is in connection with these that the association fibers are developed and the brain areas so connected that they can work together as a unit
a simple illustration will enable us to see more clearly how the nervous mechanism acts to bring this about
suppose that i am walking along a country road deeply engaged in meditation and that i come to a puddle of water in my pathway
i may turn aside and avoid the obstruction without my attention being called to it and without interruption of my train of thought
in this case the nerve current has passed from the eye over an afferent fiber to a sensory center in the nervous system below the cortex from there it has been forwarded to a motor center in the same region and on out over a motor fiber to the proper muscles which are to execute the required act
the act having been completed the sensory nerves connected with the muscles employed report the fact back that the work is done thus completing the circuit
this event may be taken as an illustration of literally thousands of acts which we perform daily without the intervention of consciousness and hence without involving the hemispheres
diagram illustrating the paths of association
if however instead of avoiding the puddle unconsciously i do so from consideration of the danger of wet feet and the disagreeableness of soiled shoes and the ridiculous appearance i shall make then the current can not take the short circuit but must pass on up to the cortex
here it awakens consciousness to take notice of the obstruction and calls forth the images which aid in directing the necessary movements
this simple illustration may be greatly complicated substituting for it one of the more complex problems which are continually presenting themselves to us for solution or the associated trains of thought that are constantly occupying our minds
but the truth of the illustration still holds
whether in the simple or the complex act there is always a forward passing of the nerve current through the sensory and thought centers and on out through the motor centers to the organs which are to be concerned in the motor response
the factors involved in a simple thus it will be seen that in the simplest act which can be considered there are the following factors  the stimulus which acts on the  the ingoing current over an afferent nerve  the sensory or interpreting cells  the fibers connecting the sensory with a motor center  the motor cells  the efferent nerve to carry the direction for the movement outward to the muscle  the motor response and finally  the report back that the act has been performed
with this in mind it fairly bewilders one to think of the marvelous complexity of the work that is going on in our nervous mechanism every moment of our life even without considering the higher thought processes at all
how with these added the resulting complexity all works out into beautiful harmony is indeed beyond comprehension
education and the training of the nervous system
fortunately many of the best opportunities for sensory and motor training do not depend on schools or courses of study
the world is full of stimuli to our senses and to our social natures and our common lives are made up of the responses we make to these stimuli the movements acts and deeds by which we fit ourselves into our world of environment
undoubtedly the most rapid and vital progress we make in our development is accomplished in the years before we have reached the age to go to school
yet it is the business of education to see that we do not lack any essential opportunity to make sure that necessary lines of stimuli or of motor training have not been omitted from our development
education to supply opportunities for stimulus and
the great problem of education is on the physical side it would seem then to provide for ourselves and those we seek to educate as rich an environment of sensory and social stimuli as possible one whose impressions will be full of suggestions to response in motor activity and the higher thought processes and then to give opportunity for thought and for expression in acts and deeds in the largest possible number of lines
and added to this must be frequent and clear sensory and motor recall a living over again of the sights and sounds and odors and the motor activities we have once experienced
there must also be the opportunity for the forming of worthy plans and ideals
for in this way the brain centers which were concerned in the original sensation or thought or movement are again brought into exercise and their development continued
through recall and imagination we are able not only greatly to multiply the effects of the immediate sensory and motor stimuli which come to us but also to improve our power of thinking by getting a fund of material upon which the mind can draw
order of development in the nervous nature has set the order in which the powers of the nervous system shall develop
and we must follow this order if we would obtain the best results
stated in technical terms the order is fundamental to
this is to say that the nerve centers controlling the larger and more general movements of the body ripen first and those governing the finer motor adjustments later
for example the larger body muscles of the child which are concerned with sitting up come under control earlier than those connected with walking
the arm muscles develop control earlier than the finger muscles and the head and neck muscles earlier than the eye muscles
so also the more general and less highly specialized powers of the mind ripen sooner than the more highly specialized
perception and observation precede powers of critical judgment and association
memory and imagination ripen earlier than reasoning and the logical ability
this all means that our educational system must be planned to follow the order of nature
children of the primary grades should not be required to write with fine pencils or pens which demand delicate finger adjustments since the brain centers for these finer co√∂rdinations are not yet developed
young children should not be set at work necessitating difficult eye control such as stitching through perforated cardboard reading fine print and the like as their eyes are not yet ready for such tasks
the more difficult analytical problems of arithmetic and relations of grammar should not be required of pupils at a time when the association areas of the brain are not yet ready for this type of thinking
for such methods violate the law of nature and the child is sure to suffer the penalty
importance of health and vigor of the nervous system parallel with opportunities for proper stimuli and response the nervous system must possess good or vigor
this depends in large degree on general health and nutrition with freedom from overfatigue
no favorableness of environment nor excellence of training can result in an efficient brain if the nerve energy has run low from depleted health want of proper nourishment or exhaustion
the influence of histologists find that the nuclei of nerve cells are shrunk as much as fifty per cent by extreme fatigue
reasonable fatigue followed by proper recuperation is not harmful but even necessary if the best development is to be attained but fatigue without proper nourishment and rest is fatal to all mental operations and indeed finally to the nervous system itself leaving it permanently in a condition of low tone and incapable of rallying to strong effort
for rapid and complete recuperation the cells must have not only the best of nourishment but opportunity for rest as well
extreme and fatigue is hostile to the development and welfare of any nervous system and especially to that of children
not only does overfatigue hinder growth but it also results in the formation of certain or poisons in the organism which are particularly harmful to nervous tissue
it is these fatigue toxins that account for many of the nervous and mental disorders which accompany breakdowns from overwork
on the whole the evil effects from mental overstrain are more to be feared than from physical overstrain
the effects of there is perhaps no greater foe to brain growth and efficiency than the nervous and condition which comes from loss of sleep or from worry
experiments in the psychological laboratories have shown that nerve cells shrivel up and lose their vitality under loss of sleep
let this go on for any considerable length of time and the loss is irreparable for the cells can never recuperate
this is especially true in the case of children or young people
many school boys and girls indeed many college students are making slow progress in their studies not because they are mentally slow or inefficient not even chiefly because they lose time that should be put on their lessons but because they are incapacitating their brains for good service through late hours and the consequent loss of sleep
add to this condition that of worry which often accompanies it from the fact of failure in lessons and a naturally good and nervous system is sure to fail
worry from whatever cause should be avoided as one would avoid poison if we would bring ourselves to the highest degree of efficiency
not only does worry temporarily unfit the mind for its best work but its evil results are permanent since the mind is left with a poorly developed or undone nervous system through which to work even after the cause for worry has been removed and the worry itself has ceased
not only should each individual seek to control the causes of worry in his own life but the home and the school should force upon childhood as few causes for worry as may be
children worry over fears of the dark over sickness and death over prospective but delayed punishment over the thousand and one real or imaginary troubles of childhood should be eliminated so far as possible
school examinations that prey on the peace of mind threats of failure of promotion all nagging and sarcasm and whatever else may cause continued pain or worry to sensitive minds should be barred from our schoolroom methods and practice
the price we force the child to pay for results through their use is too great for them to be tolerated
the factors in good for the best nutrition there is necessity first of all plenty of nourishing and healthful food
science and experience have both disproved the supposition that students should be scantily fed
claims that many brain workers are far short of their highest grade of efficiency because of starving their brains from poor diet
and not only must the food be of the right quality but the body must be in good health
little good to eat the best of food unless it is being properly digested and assimilated
and little good if all the rest is as it should be and the right amount of oxidation does not go on in the brain so as to remove the cells and make place for new ones
this warns us that pure air and a strong circulation are indispensable to the best working of our brains
no doubt many students who find their work too hard for them might locate the trouble in their stomachs or their lungs or the food they eat rather than in their minds

chapter v habit habit is our best friend or worst enemy
we are walking bundles of habits
habit is the of society keeping men patient and docile in the hard or disagreeable lot which some must fill
habit is a cable which we can not break
let me know your habits of life and you have revealed your moral standards and conduct
let me discover your intellectual habits and i understand your type of mind and methods of thought
in short our lives are largely a daily round of activities dictated by our habits in this line or that
most of our movements and acts are habitual we think as we have formed the habit of thinking we decide as we are in the habit of deciding we sleep or eat or speak as we have grown into the habit of doing these things we may even say our prayers or perform other religious exercises as matters of habit
but while habit is the veriest tyrant yet its good offices far exceed the bad even in the most fruitless or depraved life
the nature of habit many people when they speak or think of habit give the term a very narrow or limited meaning
they have in mind only certain moral or personal tendencies usually spoken of as one habits
but in order to understand habit in any thorough and complete way we must as suggested by the preceding paragraph broaden our concept to include every possible line of physical and mental activity
habit may be defined as tendency of the nervous system to repeat any act that has been performed once or many
the physical basis of habit is to be explained from the standpoint of its physical basis
habits are formed because the tissues of our brains are capable of being modified by use and of so retaining the effects of this modification that the same act is easier of performance each succeeding time
this results in the old act being repeated instead of a new one being selected and hence the old act is perpetuated
even dead and inert matter obeys the same principles in this regard as does living matter
says leon dumont everyone knows how a garment having been worn a certain time clings to the shape of the body better than when it was new there has been a change in the tissue and this change is a new habit of cohesion a lock works better after having been used some time at the outset more force was required to overcome certain roughness in the mechanism
the overcoming of this resistance is a phenomenon of habituation
it costs less trouble to fold a paper when it has been folded already
this saving of trouble is due to the essential nature of habit which brings it about that to reproduce the effect a less amount of the outward cause is required
the sounds of a violin improve by use in the hands of an able artist because the fibers of the wood at last contract habits of vibration conformed to harmonic relations
this is what gives such inestimable value to instruments that have belonged to great masters
water in flowing hollows out for itself a channel which grows broader and deeper and after having ceased to flow it resumes when it flows again the path traced for itself before
just so the impressions of outer objects fashion for themselves in the nervous system more and more appropriate paths and these vital phenomena recur under similar excitements from without when they have been interrupted for a certain time
what is true of inanimate matter is doubly true of living tissue
the tissues of the human body can be molded into almost any form you choose if taken in time
a child may be placed on his feet at too early an age and the bones of his legs form the habit of remaining bent
the flathead indian binds a board on the skull of his child and its head forms the habit of remaining flat on the top
wrong bodily postures produce curvature of the spine and pernicious modes of dress deform the bones of the chest
the muscles may be trained into the habit of keeping the shoulders straight or letting them droop those of the back to keep the body well up on the hips or to let it sag those of locomotion to give us a light springy step or to allow a shuffling carriage those of speech to give us a accurate articulation or a careless halting one and those of the face to give us a cheerful cast of countenance or a glum and morose expression
but the nervous tissue is the most sensitive and easily molded of all bodily tissues
in fact it is probable that the real of our characteristic walk gesture or speech resides in the brain rather than in the muscles which it controls
so delicate is the organization of the brain structure and so unstable its molecules that even the perfume of the flower which assails the nose of a child the song of a bird which strikes his ear or the fleeting dream which lingers but for a second in his sleep has so modified his brain that it will never again be as if these things had not been experienced
every sensory current which runs in from the outside world every motor current which runs out to command a muscle every thought that we think has so modified the nerve structure through which it acts that a tendency remains for a like act to be repeated
our brain and nervous system is daily being molded into fixed habits of acting by our thoughts and deeds and thus becomes the automatic register of all we do
the old chinese fairy story hits upon a fundamental and vital truth
these celestials tell their children that each child is accompanied by day and by night every moment of his life by an invisible fairy who is provided with a pencil and tablet
it is the duty of this fairy to put down every deed of the child both good and evil in an indelible record which will one day rise as a witness against him
so it is in very truth with our brains
the wrong act may have been performed in secret no living being may ever know that we performed it and a merciful providence may forgive it but the inexorable monitor of our deeds was all the time beside us writing the record and the history of that act is inscribed forever in the tissues of our brain
it may be repented of bitterly in sackcloth and ashes and be discontinued but its effects can never be quite effaced they will remain with us a handicap till our dying day and in some critical moment in a great emergency we shall be in danger of defeat from that long past and forgotten act
we must form we then form habits
it is not at all in our power to say whether we will form habits or not for once started they go on forming themselves by day and night steadily and relentlessly
habit is therefore one of the great factors to be reckoned with in our lives and the question becomes not shall we form habits
and we have the determining of this question largely in our own power for habits do not just happen nor do they come to us ready made
we ourselves make them from day to day through the acts we perform and in so far as we have control over our acts in that far we can determine our habits
the place of habit in the economy of our lives habit is one of nature methods of economizing time and effort while at the same time securing greater skill and efficiency
this is easily seen when it is remembered that habit tends towards action that is towards action governed by the lower nerve centers and taking care of itself so to speak without the interference of consciousness
everyone has observed how much easier in the performance and more skillful in its execution is the act be it playing a piano painting a picture or driving a nail when the movements involved have ceased to be consciously directed and become automatic
habit increases skill and practically all increase in skill whether physical or mental depends on our ability to form habits
habit holds fast to the skill already attained while practice or intelligence makes ready for the next step in advance
could we not form habits we should improve but little in our way of doing things no matter how many times we did them over
we should now be obliged to go through the same bungling process of dressing ourselves as when we first learned it as children
our writing would proceed as awkwardly in the high school as the primary our eating as adults would be as messy and wide of the mark as when we were infants and we should miss in a thousand ways the motor skill that now seems so easy and natural
all highly skilled occupations and those demanding great manual dexterity likewise depend on our power for the accurate and automatic movements required
a great portion of the fundamentals of our education must be made automatic must become matters of habit
we set out to learn the symbols of speech
we hear words and see them on the printed page associated with these words are meanings or ideas
habit binds the word and the idea together so that to think of the one is to call up the other and language is learned
we must learn numbers so we practice the combinations and with or we associate
habit secures this association in our minds and lo
and so on throughout the whole range of our learning
we learn certain symbols or facts or processes and habit takes hold and renders these automatic so that we can use them freely easily and with skill leaving our thought free for matters that can not be made automatic
one of our greatest dangers is that we shall not make sufficiently automatic enough of the necessary foundation material of education
failing in this we shall at best be but blunderers intellectually handicapped because we failed to make proper use of habit in our development
for as we have seen in an earlier chapter there is a limit to our mental energy and also to the number of objects to which we are able to attend
it is only when attention has been freed from the many things that can always be thought or done the same that the mind can devote itself to the real problems that require judgment imagination or reasoning
the writer whose spelling and punctuation do not take care of themselves will hardly make a success of writing
the mathematician whose number combinations processes and formul√¶ are not automatic in his mind can never hope to make progress in mathematical thinking
the speaker who while speaking has to think of his gestures his voice or his enunciation will never sway audiences by his logic or his eloquence
and we do most easily and with least fatigue that which we are accustomed to do
it is the new act or the strange task that tires us
the horse that is used to the farm wearies if put on the road while the roadster tires easily when hitched to the plow
the experienced penman works all day at his desk without undue fatigue while the man more accustomed to the pick and the shovel than to the pen is exhausted by a half hour writing at a letter
those who follow a sedentary and inactive occupation do not tire by much sitting while children or others used to freedom and action may find it a wearisome task merely to remain still for an hour or two
not only would the skill and speed demanded by modern industry be impossible without the aid of habit but without its help none could stand the fatigue and strain
the new workman placed at a machine is ready to fall from weariness at the end of his first day
but little by little he learns to omit the unnecessary movements the necessary movements become easier and more automatic through habit and he finds the work easier
we may conclude then that not only do consciously directed movements show less skill than the same movements made automatic by habit but they also require more effort and produce greater fatigue
habit economizes moral to have to decide each time the question comes up whether we will attend to this lecture or sermon or lesson whether we will persevere and go through this piece of disagreeable work which we have begun whether we will go to the trouble of being courteous and kind to this or that poor or unlovely or dirty whether we will take this road because it looks easy or that one because we know it to be the one we ought to take whether we will be strictly fair and honest when we might just as well be the opposite whether we will resist the temptation which dares us whether we will do this duty hard though it is which confronts us to have to decide each of these questions every time it presents itself is to put too large a proportion of our thought and energy on things which should take care of themselves
for all these things should early become so nearly habitual that they can be settled with the very minimum of expenditure of energy when they arise
the habit of it is a noble thing to be able to attend by sheer force of will when the interest lags or some more attractive thing appears but far better is it so to have formed the habit of attention that we naturally fall into that attitude when this is the desirable thing
to understand what i mean you only have to look over a class or an audience and note the different ways which people have of finally settling down to listening
some with an attitude which says now here i am ready to listen to you if you will interest me otherwise not
others with a manner which says i did not really come here expecting to listen and you will have a large task if you interest me i never listen unless i am compelled to and the responsibility rests on you
others plainly say i really mean to listen but i have hard work to control my thoughts and if i wander i shall not blame you altogether it is just my way
and still others say when i am expected to listen i always listen whether there is anything much to listen to or not
i have formed that habit and so have no quarrel with myself about it
you can depend on me to be attentive for i can not afford to weaken my habit of attention whether you do well or not
every speaker will clasp these last listeners to his heart and feed them on the choicest thoughts of his soul they are the ones to whom he speaks and to whom his address will appeal
habit enables us to meet the to be able to persevere in the face of difficulties and hardships and carry through the disagreeable thing in spite of the protests of our natures against the sacrifice which it requires is a creditable thing but it is more creditable to have so formed the habit of perseverance that the disagreeable duty shall be done without a struggle or protest or question
horace mann testifies of himself that whatever success he was able to attain was made possible through the early habit which he formed of never stopping to inquire whether he to do a thing which needed doing but of doing everything equally well and without question both the pleasant and the unpleasant
the youth who can fight out a moral battle and win against the allurements of some attractive temptation is worthy the highest honor and praise but so long as he has to fight the same battle over and over again he is on dangerous ground morally
for good morals must finally become habits so ingrained in us that the right decision comes largely without effort and without struggle
otherwise the strain is too great and defeat will occasionally come and defeat means weakness and at last disaster after the spirit has tired of the constant conflict
good habits are more to be coveted than individual victories in special cases much as these are to be desired
for good habits mean victories all along the line
habit the foundation of the biologist
tells us that it is the and not the in the environment that impresses itself on an organism
so also it is the in our lives that builds itself into our character and personality
what we are in the habit of doing and thinking
without habit personality could not exist for we could never do a thing twice alike and hence would be a new person each succeeding moment
the acts which give us our own peculiar individuality are our habitual acts the little things that do themselves moment by moment without care or attention and are the truest and best expression of our real selves
probably no one of us could be very sure which arm he puts into the sleeve or which foot he puts into the shoe first and yet each of us certainly formed the habit long ago of doing these things in a certain way
we might not be able to describe just how we hold knife and fork and spoon and yet each has his own characteristic and habitual way of handling them
we sit down and get up in some characteristic way and the very poise of our heads and attitudes of our bodies are the result of habit
we get sleepy and wake up become hungry and thirsty at certain hours through force of habit
we form the habit of liking a certain chair or nook or corner or path or desk and then seek this to the exclusion of all others
we habitually use a particular pitch of voice and type of enunciation in speaking and this becomes one of our characteristic marks or we form the habit of using barbarisms or solecisms of language in youth and these cling to us and become an inseparable part of us later in life
on the mental side the case is no different
our thinking is as characteristic as our physical acts
we may form the habit of thinking things out logically or of jumping to conclusions of thinking critically and independently or of taking things unquestioningly on the authority of others
we may form the habit of carefully reading good sensible books or of skimming sentimental and trashy ones of choosing elevating ennobling companions or the opposite of being a good conversationalist and doing our part in a social group or of being a drag on the conversation and needing to be entertained
we may form the habit of observing the things about us and enjoying the beautiful in our environment or of failing to observe or to enjoy
we may form the habit of obeying the voice of conscience or of weakly yielding to temptation without a struggle of taking a reverent attitude of prayer in our devotions or of merely saying our prayers
habit saves worry and habit has been called the balance wheel of society
this is because men readily become habituated to the hard the disagreeable or the inevitable and cease to battle against it
a lot that at first seems unendurable after a time causes less revolt
a sorrow that seems too poignant to be borne in the course of time loses some of its sharpness
oppression or injustice that arouses the fiercest resentment and hate may finally come to be accepted with resignation
habit helps us learn that what can not be cured must be endured
the tyranny of habit even good habits need to be but even in good habits there is danger
habit is the opposite of attention
habit relieves attention of unnecessary strain
every habitual act was at one time either in the history of the race or of the individual a voluntary act that is it was performed under active attention
as the habit grew attention was gradually rendered unnecessary until finally it dropped entirely out
habit once formed has no way of being modified unless in some way attention is called to it for a habit left to itself becomes more and more firmly fixed
in very few if any of our actions can we afford to have this the case
our habits need to be progressive they need to grow to be modified to be improved
otherwise they will become an incrusting shell fixed and unyielding which will limit our growth
it is necessary then to keep our habitual acts under some surveillance of attention to pass them in review for inspection every now and then that we may discover possible modifications which will make them more serviceable
we need to be inventive constantly to find out better ways of doing things
habit takes care of our standing walking sitting but how many of us could not improve his poise and carriage if he would
our speech has become largely automatic but no doubt all of us might remove faults of enunciation pronunciation or stress from our speaking
so also we might better our habits of study and thinking our methods of memorizing or our manner of attending
the tendency of ruts but this will require something of heroism
for to follow the path of custom is easy and pleasant while to break out of the rut of habit and start a new line of action is difficult and disturbing
most people prefer to keep doing things as they always have done them to continue reading and thinking and believing as they have long been in the habit of doing not so much because they feel that their way is best but because it is easier than to change
hence the great mass of us settle down on the plane of mediocrity and become old fogy
we learn to do things passably well cease to think about improving our ways of doing them and so fall into a rut
they make use of habit as the rest do but they also continue to attend at critical points of action and so make habit an in place of accepting it as a
a part of education it follows from the importance of habit in our lives that no small part of education should be concerned with the development of serviceable habits
says james could the young but realize how soon they will become mere walking bundles of habits they would give more heed to their conduct while in the plastic state
we are spinning our own fates good or evil and never to be undone
every smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its scar
any youth who is forming a large number of useful habits is receiving no mean education no matter if his knowledge of books may be limited on the other hand no one who is forming a large number of bad habits is being well educated no matter how brilliant his knowledge may be
youth the time for childhood and youth is the great time for
then the brain is plastic and easily molded and it retains its impressions more indelibly later it is hard to modify and the impressions made are less permanent
it is hard to teach an old dog new tricks nor would he remember them if you could teach them to him nor be able to perform them well even if he could remember them
the young child will within the first few weeks of its life form habits of sleeping and feeding
it may in a few days be led into the habit of sleeping in the dark or requiring a light of going to sleep lying quietly or of insisting upon being rocked of getting hungry by the clock or of wanting its food at all times when it finds nothing else to do and so on
it is wholly outside the power of the mother or the nurse to determine whether the child shall form habits but largely within their power to say what habits shall be formed since they control his acts
as the child grows older the range of his habits increases and by the time he has reached his middle teens the greater number of his personal habits are formed
it is very doubtful whether a boy who has not formed habits of punctuality before the age of fifteen will ever be entirely trustworthy in matters requiring precision in this line
the girl who has not before this age formed habits of neatness and order will hardly make a tidy housekeeper later in her life
those who in youth have no opportunity to habituate themselves to the usages of society may study books on etiquette and employ private instructors in the art of polite behavior all they please later in life but they will never cease to be awkward and ill at ease
none are at a greater disadvantage than the who attempt late in life to surround themselves with articles of art and luxury though their habits were all formed amid barrenness and want during their earlier years
the habit of what youth does not dream of being great or noble or a celebrated scholar
and how few there are who finally achieve their ideals
where does the cause of failure lie
surely not in the lack of high ideals
multitudes of young people have excelsior
as their motto and yet never get started up the mountain slope let alone toiling on to its top
they have put in hours dreaming of the glory farther up have never begun to
the difficulty comes in not realizing that the only way to become what we wish or dream that we may become is form the habit of being that
to form the habit of achievement of effort of if need be
to form the habit of deeds along with dreams to form the habit of
who of us has not at this moment lying in wait for his convenience in the dim future a number of things which he means to do just as soon as this term of school is finished or this job of work is completed or when he is not so busy as now
and how seldom does he ever get at these things at all
darwin tells that in his youth he loved poetry art and music but was so busy with his scientific work that he could ill spare the time to indulge these tastes
so he promised himself that he would devote his time to scientific work and make his mark in this
then he would have time for the things that he loved and would cultivate his taste for the fine arts
he made his mark in the field of science and then turned again to poetry to music to art
they were all dead and dry bones to him without life or interest
he had passed the time when he could ever form the taste for them
he had formed his habits in another direction and now it was forever too late to form new habits
his own conclusion is that if he had his life to live over again he would each week listen to some musical concert and visit some art gallery and that each day he would read some poetry and thereby keep alive and active the love for them
so every school and home should be a species of a place where children develop habits of neatness punctuality obedience politeness dependability and the other graces of character
three maxims for on the forming of new habits and the leaving off of old ones i know of no better statement than that of james based on bain chapter on moral habits
i quote this statement at some length in the acquisition of a new habit or the leaving off of an old one we must take care to ourselves with as strong and decided an initiative as
accumulate all the possible circumstances which shall re√´nforce right motives put yourself assiduously in conditions that encourage the new way make engagements incompatible with the old take a public pledge if the case allows in short develop your resolution with every aid you know
this will give your new beginning such a momentum that the temptation to break down will not occur as soon as it otherwise might and every day during which a breakdown is postponed adds to the chances of its not occurring at all
the second maxim is suffer an exception to occur until the new habit is securely rooted in your life
each lapse is like letting fall a ball of string which one is carefully winding up a single slip undoes more than a great many turns will wind again
of training is the great means of making the nervous system act infallibly right
the need of securing success nerves one to future vigor
a third maxim may be added to the preceding pair
seize the very first possible opportunity to act on every resolution you make and on every emotional prompting you may experience in the direction of the habits you aspire to gain
it is not in the moment of their forming but in the moment of their producing that resolves and aspirations communicate the new ' to the brain
the preponderance of good habits over and finally let no one be disturbed or afraid because in a little time you become a walking bundle of habits
for in so far as your good actions predominate over your bad ones that much will your good habits outweigh your bad habits
silently moment by moment efficiency is growing out of all worthy acts well done
every bit of heroic every battle fought and won every good deed performed is being irradicably credited to you in your nervous system and will finally add its mite toward achieving the success of your ambitions
select some act which you have recently begun to perform and watch it grow more and more habitual
notice carefully for a week and see whether you do not discover some habits which you did not know you had
make a catalog of your bad habits of the most important of your good ones
set out to form some new habits which you desire to possess also to break some undesirable habit watching carefully what takes place in both cases and how long it requires
try the following experiment and relate the results to the matter of automatic control brought about by habit
draw a star on a sheet of cardboard
place this on a table before you with a so arranged that you can see the star in the mirror
now trace the outline of the star with a pencil looking steadily in the mirror to guide your hand
do not lift the pencil from the paper from the time you start until you finish
have others try this experiment
study some group of pupils for their habits  of attention  of speech  of standing sitting and walking  of study
report on your observations and suggest methods of curing bad habits observed
make a list of mannerisms you have observed and suggest how they may be cured
make a list of from ten to twenty habits which you think the school and its work should especially cultivate
what ones of these are the schools you know least successful in cultivating
we can best understand the problems of sensation and perception if we first think of the existence of two great worlds the world of physical nature without and the world of mind within
on the one hand is our material environment the things we see and hear and touch and taste and handle and on the other hand our consciousness the means by which we come to know this outer world and adjust ourselves to it
these two worlds seem in a sense to belong to and require each other
for what would be the meaning or use of the physical world with no mind to know or use it and what would be the use of a mind with nothing to be known or thought about
there is a marvel about our coming to know the external world which we shall never be able fully to understand
we have come by this knowledge so gradually and unconsciously that it now appears to us as commonplace and we take for granted many things that it would puzzle us to explain
knowledge through the for example we say of course i see yonder green tree it is about ten rods distant
why should objects at a distance from us and with no evident connection between us and them be known to us at all merely by turning our eyes in their direction when there is light
why not rather say with the blind son of professor puiseaux of paris who when asked if he would like to be restored to sight answered if it were not for curiosity i would rather have long arms
it seems to me that my hands would teach me better what is passing in the moon than your eyes or telescopes
we listen and then say yes that is a certain bell ringing in the neighboring village as if this were the most simple thing in the world
but why should one piece of metal striking against another a mile or two away make us aware that there is a bell there at all let alone that it is a certain bell whose tone we recognize
or we pass our fingers over a piece of cloth and decide that is silk
but why merely by placing our skin in contact with a bit of material should we be able to know its quality much less that it is cloth and that its threads were originally spun by an insect
or we take a sip of liquid and say this milk is sour
but why should we be able by taking the liquid into the mouth and bringing it into contact with the mucous membrane to tell that it is milk and that it possesses the quality which we call
or once more we get a whiff of air through the open window in the springtime and say there is a lilac bush in bloom on the lawn
yet why from inhaling air containing particles of lilac should we be able to know that there is anything outside much less that it is a flower and of a particular variety which we call lilac
or finally we hold a heated flatiron up near the cheek and say this is too hot
but why by holding this object a foot away from the face do we know that it is there let alone knowing its temperature
the unity of sensory further our senses come through experience to have the power of fusing or combining their knowledge so to speak by which each expresses its knowledge in terms of the others
thus we take a glance out of the window and say that the day looks cold although we well know that we can not see
or we say that the melon sounds green or the bell sounds cracked although a or can not be heard
or we say that the box feels empty although can not be felt
we have come to associate cold originally experienced with days which look like the one we now see with this particular appearance and so we say we see the cold sounds like the one coming from the bell we have come to associate with cracked bells and that coming from the melon with green melons until we say unhesitatingly that the bell sounds cracked and the melon sounds green
each gleans from the world its own particular bit of knowledge but all are finally in a partnership and what is each one knowledge belongs to every other one in so far as the other can use it
the sensory processes to be the explanation of the ultimate nature of knowledge and how we reach it through contact with our material environment we will leave to the philosophers
and battles enough they have over the question and still others they will have before the matter is settled
the easier and more important problem for us is to describe the by which the mind comes to know its environment and to see how it uses this knowledge in thinking
this much we shall be able to do for it is often possible to describe a process and discover its laws even when we can not fully explain its nature and origin
we know the process of digestion and assimilation and the laws which govern them although we do not understand the ultimate nature and origin of
the qualities of objects exist in the yet even in the relatively simple description which we have proposed many puzzles confront us and one of them appears at the very outset
this is that the qualities which we usually ascribe to objects really exist in our own minds and not in the objects at all
take for instance the common qualities of light and color
the physicist tells us that what we see as light is occasioned by an incredibly rapid beating of ether waves on the retina of the eye
all space is filled with this ether and when it is light that is when some object like the sun or other body is present the ether is set in motion by the vibrating molecules of the body which is the source of light its waves strike the retina a current is produced and carried to the brain and we see light
this means then that space the medium in which we see objects is not filled with light the sensation but with very rapid waves of ether and that the light which we see really occurs in our own minds as the mental response to the physical stimulus of ether waves
color is produced by ether waves of different lengths and degrees of rapidity
thus ether waves at the rate of  billions a second give us the sensation of red of  billions a second orange of  billions a second yellow of  billions a second green of  billions a second blue of  billions a second indigo of  billions a second violet
what exists outside of us then is these ether waves of different rates and not the colors as sensations themselves
the beautiful yellow and crimson of a sunset the variegated colors of a landscape the delicate pink in the cheek of a child the blush of a rose the shimmering green of the lake
these reside not in the objects themselves but in the consciousness of the one who sees them
the objects possess but the quality of reflecting back to the eye ether waves of the particular rate corresponding to the color which we ascribe to them
thus red objects and no others reflect back ether waves of a rate of  billions a second white objects reflect all rates black objects reflect none
the case is no different with regard to sound
when we speak of a sound coming from a bell what we really mean is that the vibrations of the bell have set up waves in the air between it and our ear which have produced corresponding vibrations in the ear that a nerve current was thereby produced and that a sound was heard
but the sound sensation is a mental thing and exists only in our own consciousness
what passed between the sounding object and ourselves was waves in the intervening air ready to be translated through the machinery of nerves and brain into the beautiful tones and melodies and harmonies of the mind
and so with all other sensations
the three sets of what exists outside of us therefore is a some form of physical energy of a kind suitable to excite to activity a certain of taste or touch or smell or sight or hearing what exists within us is the capable of converting this stimulus into a nerve current which shall produce an activity in the cortex of the brain what results is the which we call a of taste smell touch sight or hearing
the nature of sensation sensation gives us our world of in actual experience sensations are never known apart from the objects to which they belong
this is to say that when we see or
it is always in connection with some surface or object when we taste this quality belongs to some substance and so on with all the senses
the simple qualities of objects known in consciousness as the result of appropriate stimuli applied to
we shall later see how by perception these qualities fuse or combine to form objects but in the present chapter we shall be concerned with the qualities only
sensations are then the simplest and most elementary knowledge we may get from the physical world the red the blue the bitter the cold the fragrant and whatever other qualities may belong to the external world
we shall not for the present be concerned with the objects or sources from which the qualities may come
to quote james on the meaning of sensation all we can say on this point is that
what we mean by sensations are first things in the way of
they are the results upon consciousness of nerve currents as they enter the brain and before they have awakened any suggestions or associations with past experience
but it is obvious that immediate sensations can be realized only in the earliest days of
the attributes of sensations differ from each other in at least four respects namely and
it is a difference in that makes us say this paper is red and that blue this liquid is sweet and that sour
differences in quality are therefore fundamental differences in
besides the that exist within the same general field as of taste or vision it is evident that there is a still more fundamental difference existing between the various fields
one can for example compare red with blue or sweet with sour and tell which quality he prefers
but let him try to compare red with sweet or blue with sour and the is so profound that there seems to be no basis for comparison
differences in of sensation are familiar to every person who prefers two lumps of sugar rather than one lump in his coffee the sweet is of the same quality in either case but differs in intensity
in every field of sensation the intensity may proceed from the smallest amount to the greatest amount discernible
in general the intensity of the sensation depends on the intensity of the stimulus though the condition of the as regards fatigue or adaptation to the stimulus has its effect
it is obvious that a stimulus may be too weak to produce any sensation as for example a few grains of sugar in a cup of coffee or a few drops of lemon in a quart of water could not be detected
it is also true that the intensity of the stimulus may be so great that an increase in intensity produces no effect on the sensation as for example the addition of sugar to a solution of saccharine would not noticeably increase its sweetness
the lowest and highest intensity points of sensation are called the lower and upper or threshold respectively
the touch of the point of a toothpick on the skin has a different space quality from the touch of the flat end of a pencil
low tones seem to have more volume than high tones
some pains feel sharp and others dull and diffuse
the warmth felt from spreading the palms of the hands out to the fire has a bigness not felt from heating one solitary finger
the extensity of a sensation depends on the number of nerve endings stimulated
the of a sensation refers to the time it lasts
this must not be confused with the duration of the stimulus which may be either longer or shorter than the duration of the sensation
every sensation must exist for some space of time long or short or it would have no part in consciousness
sensory qualities and their all are familiar with the five senses of our elementary physiologies sight hearing taste smell and touch
a more complete study of sensation reveals nearly three times this number however
this is to say that the body is equipped with more than a dozen different kinds of each prepared to receive its own particular type of stimulus
it must also be understood that some of the yield more than one sense
the eye for example gives not only visual but muscular sensations the ear not only auditory but tactual the tongue not only gustatory but tactual and cold and warmth sensations
vision is a sense we can see afar off
the stimulus is in its action this means that the ether waves on striking the retina cause a chemical change which sets up the nerve current responsible for the sensation
the eye whose general structure is sufficiently described in all standard physiologies consists of a visual apparatus designed to bring the images of objects to a clear focus on the retina at the or area of clearest vision near the point of entrance of the optic nerve
the sensation of sight coming from this retinal image unaided by other sensations gives us but two qualities and
the eye can distinguish many different grades of light from purest white on through the various grays to densest black
the range is greater still in color
we speak of the seven colors of the spectrum violet indigo blue green yellow orange and red
but this is not a very serviceable classification since the average eye can distinguish about color effects
it is also somewhat bewildering to find that all these colors seem to be produced from the four fundamental hues red green yellow and blue plus the various tints
these four combined in varying proportions and with different degrees of light different shades of gray yield all the color effects known to the human eye
herschel estimates that the workers on the mosaics at rome must have distinguished different color tones
the of a color refers to its fundamental quality as red or yellow the to its saturation or the strength of the color and the to the amount of brightness white it contains
hearing is also a distance sense
the action of its stimulus is mechanical which is to say that the vibrations produced in the air by the sounding body are finally transmitted by the mechanism of the middle ear to the inner ear
here the impulse is conveyed through the liquid of the internal ear to the nerve endings as so many tiny blows which produce the nerve current carried to the brain by the auditory nerve
the sensation of hearing like that of sight gives us two qualities namely with their accompanying pitch and timbre and
tones or musical sounds are produced by isochronous or vibrations thus of the first octave is produced by  vibrations a second and if this tone is prolonged the vibration rate will continue uniformly the same
noises on the other hand are produced by vibrations which have no uniformity of vibration rate
the ear sensibility to pitch extends over about seven octaves
the piano goes down to vibrations and reaches up to vibrations
notes of nearly vibrations can be heard by an average ear however though these are too painfully shrill to be musical
taking into account this upper limit the range of the ear is about eleven octaves
the ear having given us of tones which depends on the amplitude of the vibrations which depends on the rapidity of the vibrations and or which depends on the complexity of the vibrations has no further qualities of sound to reveal
the sense of taste is located chiefly in the tongue over the surface of which are scattered many minute
these can be seen as small red specks most plentifully distributed along the edges and at the tip of the tongue
the substance tasted must be in and come in contact with the nerve endings
the sense of taste recognizes the four qualities of and
many of the qualities which we improperly call tastes are in reality a complex of taste smell touch and temperature
smell contributes so largely to the sense of taste that many articles of food become tasteless when we have a catarrh and many nauseating doses of medicine can be taken without discomfort if the nose is held
probably none of us if we are careful to exclude all odors by plugging the nostrils with cotton can by taste distinguish between scraped apple potato turnip or beet or can tell hot milk from tea or coffee of the same temperature
in the upper part of the nasal cavity lies a small brownish patch of mucous membrane
it is here that the olfactory nerve endings are located
the substance smelled must be volatile that is must exist in gaseous form and come in direct contact with the nerve endings
chemical action results in a nerve current
the sensations of smell have not been classified so well as those of taste and we have no distinct names for them
neither do we know how many olfactory qualities the sense of smell is capable of revealing
the only definite classification of smell qualities is that based on their pleasantness or the opposite
we also borrow a few terms and speak of or odors and or smells
there is some evidence when we observe animals or even primitive men that the human race has been evolving greater sensibility to certain odors while at the same time there has been a loss of keenness of what we call scent
various sensations from the the skin besides being a protective and excretory organ affords a for the giving us our sense of pressure pain cold warmth tickle and itch
seems to have for its the of the skin on hairless regions small bulbs called the of serve this purpose
is thought to be mediated by free nerve endings
depends on called the of and on the
cutaneous or skin sensation may arise from either stimulation such as pressure a blow or tickling from stimulation from hot or cold objects from stimulation or from the action of certain such as acids and the like
stimulated mechanically the skin gives us but two sensation qualities and
many of the qualities which we commonly ascribe to the skin sensations are really a complex of cutaneous and muscular sensations
and depend on the intensity of the pressure
arise from interrupted and continuous pressure respectively and require movement over the rough or smooth surface
depends on pressure accompanied by the muscular sensations involved in the movements connected with the act
pain is clearly a different sensation from pressure but any of the cutaneous or muscular sensations may by excessive stimulation be made to pass over into pain
all parts of the skin are sensitive to pressure and pain but certain parts like the finger tips and the tip of the tongue are more highly sensitive than others
the skin varies also in its sensitivity to and
if we take a hot or a very cold pencil point and pass it rather lightly and slowly over the skin it is easy to discover certain spots from which a sensation of warmth or of cold flashes out
in this way it is possible to locate the of temperature very accurately
diagram showing distribution of hot and cold spots on the back of the hand
the kin√¶sthetic the muscles tendons and joints also give rise to perfectly definite sensations but they have not been named as have the sensations from most of the other
is the most clearly marked of these sensations
it is through the sensations connected with movements of muscles tendons and joints that we come to judge and
the organic finally to the sensations mentioned so far must be added those which come from the internal organs of the body
from the alimentary canal we get the sensations of and from the heart lungs and organs of sex come numerous but unnamed sensations which play an important part in making up the of our daily lives
thus we see that the senses may be looked upon as the sentries of the body standing at the outposts where nature and ourselves meet
they discover the qualities of the various objects with which we come in contact and hand them over to the mind in the form of sensations
and these sensations are the raw material out of which we begin to construct our material environment
only as we are equipped with good organs of sense especially good eyes and ears therefore are we able to enter fully into the wonderful world about us and receive the stimuli necessary to our thought and action
observe a schoolroom of children at work with the aim of discovering any that show defects of vision or hearing
what is the effect of inability to hear or see well upon interest and attention
talk with your teacher about testing the eyes and ears of the children of some school
the simpler tests for vision and hearing are easily applied and the expense for material almost nothing
does your school have the test card for vision
use a rotator or color tops for mixing discs of white and black to produce different shades of gray
fix in mind the gray made of half white and half black white and black and black
in the same way mix the two complementaries yellow and blue to produce a gray mix red and green in the same way
try various combinations of the four fundamental colors and discover how different colors are produced
seek for these same colors in nature sky leaves flowers etc
take a large wire nail and push it through a cork so that it can be handled without touching the metal with the fingers
now cool it in ice or very cold water then dry it and move the point slowly across the back of the hand
do you feel occasional thrills of cold as the point passes over a bulb of krause
heat the nail with a match flame or over a lamp and perform the same experiment
do you feel the thrills of heat from the corpuscles of ruffini
try stopping the nostrils with cotton and having someone give you scraped apple potato onion and see whether by taste alone you can distinguish the difference
no young child at first sees objects as we see them or hears sounds as we hear them
this power the power of perception is a gradual development
it grows day by day out of the learner experience in his world of sights and sounds and whatever other fields his senses respond to
the function of perception need of knowing the material it is the business of perception to give us knowledge of our world of material and their relations in and
the material world which we enter through the gateways of the senses is more marvelous by far than any fairy world created by the fancy of for it contains the elements of all they have conceived and much more besides
it is more marvelous than any structure planned and executed by the mind of man for all the wonders and beauties of the coliseum or of peter existed in nature before they were discovered by the architect and thrown together in those magnificent structures
the material advancement of civilization has been but the discovery of the objects forces and laws of nature and their use in inventions serviceable to men
and these forces and laws of nature were discovered only as they were made manifest through objects in the material world
the problem lying before each individual who would enter fully into this rich world of environment then is to discover at first hand just as large a part of the material world about him as possible
in the most humble environment of the most uneventful life is to be found the material for discoveries and inventions yet undreamed of
lying in the shade of an apple tree under the open sky newton read from a falling apple the fundamental principles of the law of gravitation which has revolutionized science sitting at a humble tea table watt watched the gurgling of the steam escaping from the kettle and evolved the steam engine therefrom with his simple kite franklin drew down the lightning from the clouds and started the science of electricity through studying a ball the ancient scholars conceived the earth to be a sphere and columbus discovered america
the problem which confronts the well it is that the child starting his life journey can not see the magnitude of the task before him
cast amid a world of objects of whose very existence he is ignorant and whose meaning and uses have to be learned by slow and often painful experience he proceeds step by step through the senses in his discovery of the objects about him
yet considered again we ourselves are after all but a step in advance of the child
though we are somewhat more familiar with the use of our senses than he and know a few more objects about us yet the knowledge of the wisest of us is at best pitifully meager compared with the richness of nature
so impossible is it for us to know all our material environment that men have taken to becoming specialists
one man will spend his life in the study of a certain variety of plants while there are hundreds of thousands of varieties all about him another will study a particular kind of animal life perhaps too minute to be seen with the naked eye while the world is teeming with animal forms which he has not time in his short day of life to stop to examine another will study the land forms and read the earth history from the rocks and geological strata but here again nature volume is so large that he has time to read but a small fraction of the whole
another studies the human body and learns to read from its expressions the signs of health and sickness and to prescribe remedies for its ills but in this field also he has found it necessary to divide the work and so we have specialists for almost every organ of the body
how a percept is how then do we proceed to the discovery of this world of objects
let us watch the child and learn the secret from him
give the babe a ball and he applies every sense to it to discover its qualities
he stares at it he takes it in his hands and turns it over and around he lifts it he strokes it he punches it and jabs it he puts it to his mouth and bites it he drops it he throws it and creeps after it
he leaves no stone unturned to find out what that thing really is
by means of the which come to him through the avenues of sense he constructs the
and not only does he come to know the ball as a material object but he comes to know also its uses
he is forming his own best definition of a ball in terms of the sensations which he gets from it and the uses to which he puts it and all this even before he can name it or is able to recognize its name when he hears it
how much better his method than the one he will have to follow a little later when he goes to school and learns that a ball is a spherical body of any substance or size used to play with as by throwing kicking or knocking
the percept involves all relations of the nor is the case in the least different with ourselves
when we wish to learn about a new object or discover new facts about an old one we do precisely as the child does if we are wise
we apply to it every sense to which it will afford a stimulus and finally arrive at the object through its various qualities
and just in so far as we have failed to use in connection with it every sense to which it can minister just in that degree will we have an incomplete perception of it
indeed just so far as we have failed finally to perceive it in terms of its functions or uses in that far also have we failed to know it completely
tomatoes were for many years grown as ornamental garden plants before it was discovered that the tomatoes could minister to the taste as well as to the sight
the clothing of civilized man gives the same sensation of texture and color to the savage that it does to its owner but he is so far from perceiving it in the same way that he packs it away and continues to go naked
the orientals who disdain the use of chairs and prefer to sit on the floor can never perceive a chair just as we do who use chairs daily and to whom chairs are so saturated with social suggestions and associations
the content of the the percept then always contains a basis of
the eye the ear the skin or some other sense organ must turn in its supply of sensory material or there can be no percept
but the percept contains more than just sensations
consider for example your percept of an automobile flashing past your windows
you really but very little of it yet you
all that your sense organs furnish is a more or less blurred patch of black of certain size and contour one or more objects of somewhat different color whom you know to be passengers and various sounds of a whizzing chugging or roaring nature
your former experience with automobiles enables you to associate with these meager sensory details the upholstered seats the whirling wheels the swaying movement and whatever else belongs to the full meaning of a motor car
the percept that contained only sensory material and lacked all memory elements ideas and meanings would be no percept at all
and this is the reason why a young child can not see or hear like ourselves
it lacks the associative material to give significance and meaning to the sensory elements supplied by the
the dependence of the percept on material from past experience is also illustrated in the common statement that what one gets from an art exhibit or a concert depends on what he brings to it
he who brings no knowledge no memory no images from other pictures or music will secure but relatively barren percepts consisting of little besides the mere sensory elements
truly to him that hath shall be given in the realm of perception
the accuracy of percepts depends on we must perceive objects through our motor response to them as well as in terms of sensations
the boy who has his knowledge of a tennis racket from looking at one in a store window or indeed from handling one and looking it over in his room can never know a tennis racket as does the boy who plays with it on the court
objects get their significance not alone from their qualities but even more from their use as related to our own activities
like the child we must get our knowledge of objects if we are to get it well from the objects themselves at first hand and not second hand through descriptions of them by others
the fact that there is so much of the material world about us that we can never hope to learn it all has made it necessary to put down in books many of the things which have been discovered concerning nature
this necessity has i fear led many away from nature itself to books away from the living reality of things to the dead embalming cases of words in whose empty forms we see so little of the significance which resides in the things themselves
we are in danger of being satisfied with the of knowledge without its with definitions contained in words instead of in qualities and uses
not definitions but in like manner we come to know distance form and size
if we have never become acquainted with a mile by actually walking a mile running a mile riding a bicycle a mile driving a horse a mile or traveling a mile on a train we might listen for a long time to someone tell how far a mile is or state the distance from chicago to denver without knowing much about it in any way except word definitions
in order to understand a mile we must come to know it in as many ways as possible through sense activities of our own
although many children have learned that it is miles around the earth probably no one who has not encircled the globe has any reasonably accurate notion just how far this is
for words can not take the place of perceptions in giving us knowledge
in the case of shorter distances the same rule holds
the eye must be assisted by experience of the muscles and tendons and joints in actually covering distance and learn to associate these sensations with those of the eye before the eye alone can be able to say that tree is ten rods distant
form and size are to be learned in the same way
the hands must actually touch and handle the object experiencing its hardness or smoothness the way this curve and that angle feels the amount of muscular energy it takes to pass the hand over this surface and along that line the eye taking note all the while before the eye can tell at a glance that yonder object is a sphere and that this surface is two feet on the edge
the perception of space many have been the philosophical controversies over the nature of space and our perception of it
the psychologists have even quarreled concerning whether we possess an sense of space or whether it is a product of experience and training
fortunately for our present purpose we shall not need to concern ourselves with either of these controversies
for our discussion we may accept space for what common sense understands it to be
as to our sense of space whatever of this we may possess at birth it certainly has to be developed by use and experience to become of practical value
in the perception of space we must come to perceive and
as a matter of fact however size is but so much distance and form is but so much distance in this that or the other direction
the perceiving of unquestionably the eye comes to be our chief dependence in determining distance
yet the muscle and joint senses give us our earliest knowledge of distance
the babe reaches for the moon simply because the eye does not tell it that the moon is out of reach
only as the child reaches for its playthings creeps or walks after them and in a thousand ways uses its muscles and joints in measuring distance does the perception of distance become dependable
at the same time the eye is slowly developing its power of judging distance
but not for several years does visual perception of distance become in any degree accurate
the eye perception of distance depends in part on the sensations arising from the muscles controlling the eye probably in part from the adjustment of the lens and in part from the retinal image
if one tries to look at the tip of his nose he easily feels the muscle strain caused by the required angle of adjustment
we come unconsciously to associate distance with the muscle sensations arising from the different angles of vision
the part played by the retinal image in judging distance is easily understood in looking at two trees one thirty feet and the other three hundred feet distant
we note that the nearer tree shows the of the bark and leaves while the more distant one lacks this detail
the nearer tree also reflects more and than the one farther away
these minute differences registered as they are on the retinal image come to stand for so much of distance
the ear also learns to perceive distance through differences in the quality and the intensity of sound
auditory perception of distance is however never very accurate
the perceiving of the motor senses probably give us our first perception of direction as they do of distance
the child has to reach this way or that way for his rattle turn the eyes or head so far in order to see an interesting object twist the body crawl or walk to one side or the other to secure his bottle
in these experiences he is gaining his first knowledge of direction
along with these experiences the eye is also being trained
the position of the image on the retina comes to stand for direction and the eye finally develops so remarkable a power of perceiving direction that a picture hung a half inch out of plumb is a source of annoyance
the ear develops some skill in the perception of direction but is less dependable than the eye
the perception of time the philosophers and psychologists agree little better about our sense of time than they do about our sense of space
of this much however we may be certain our perception of time is subject to development and training
nature of the time how we perceive time is not so well understood as our perception of space
it is evident however that our idea of time is simpler than our idea of space it has less of content less that we can describe
probably the most fundamental part of our idea of time is or change without which it is difficult to think of time at all
the question then becomes how do we perceive change or succession
if one looks in upon his thought stream he finds that the movement of consciousness is not uniformly continuous but that his thought moves in pulses or short rushes so to speak
when we are seeking for some fact or conclusion there is a moment of expectancy or poising and then the leap forward to the desired point or conclusion from which an immediate start is taken for the next objective point of our thinking
it is probable that our sense of the few seconds of passing time that we call the consists of the recognition of the succession of these pulsations of consciousness together with certain organic rhythms such as heart beat and breathing
no perception of empty our perception does not therefore act upon empty time
time must be filled with a procession of events whether these be within our own consciousness or in the objective world without
all longer periods of time such as hours days or years are measured by the events which they contain
time filled with happenings that interest and attract us seems short while passing but longer when looked back upon
on the other hand time relatively empty of interesting experience hangs heavy on our hands in passing but viewed in retrospect seems short
a fortnight of travel passes more quickly than a fortnight of illness but yields many more events for the memory to review as the filling for time
probably no one has any very accurate feeling of the length that is the actual of a year or even of a month
we therefore divide time into convenient units as weeks months years and centuries
this allows us to think of time in mathematical terms where immediate perception fails in its grasp
in the physical world as in the spiritual there are many people who having eyes see not and ears hear not
for the ability to perceive accurately and richly in the world of physical objects depends not alone on good sense organs but also on and the habit of
it is easy if we are indifferent or untrained to look at a beautiful landscape a picture or a cathedral without
it it is easy if we lack interest or skill to listen to an orchestra or the myriad sounds of nature without them
perception needs to be training in perception does not depend entirely on the work of the school
for the world about us exerts a constant appeal to our senses
a thousand sights sounds contacts tastes smells or other sensations hourly throng in upon us and the appeal is irresistible
yet it can not be denied that most of us are relatively unskilled in perception we do not know how or take the trouble to observe
for example a stranger was brought into the classroom and introduced by the instructor to a class of fifty college students in psychology
the class thought the stranger was to address them and looked at him with mild curiosity
but after standing before them for a few moments he suddenly withdrew as had been arranged by the instructor
the class were then asked to write such a description of the stranger as would enable a person who had never seen him to identify him
but so poor had been the observation of the class that they ascribed to him clothes of four different colors eyes and hair each of three different colors a tie of many different hues height ranging from five feet and four inches to over six feet age from to years and many other details as wide of the mark
nor is it probable that this particular class was below the average in the power of perception
school training in the school can do much in training the perception
but to accomplish this the child must constantly be brought into immediate contact with the physical world about him and taught to observe
books must not be substituted for things
definitions must not take the place of experiment or discovery
geography and nature study should be taught largely out of doors and the lessons assigned should take the child into the open for observation and investigation
all things that live and grow the sky and clouds the sunset colors the brown of upturned soil the smell of the clover field or the new mown hay the sounds of a summer night the distinguishing marks by which to identify each family of common birds or breed of cattle these and a thousand other things that appeal to us from the simplest environment afford a rich opportunity for training the perception
and he who has learned to observe and who is alert to the appeal of nature has no small part of his education already assured
test your power of observation by walking rapidly past a store window and then seeing how many of the objects you can name
suppose a tailor a bootblack a physician and a detective are standing on the street corner as you pass by
what will each one be most likely to observe about you
observe carefully green trees at a distance of a few rods a quarter of a mile a mile several miles
describe differences  in color  in brightness or light and  in detail
how many common birds can you identify
observe the work of an elementary school for the purpose of determining a
whether the instruction in geography nature study agriculture calls for the use of the eyes ears and fingers
whether definitions are used in place of information in any subjects
whether the assignment of lessons to pupils includes work that would require the use of the senses especially out of doors
whether the work offered in arithmetic demands the use of the senses as well as the reason whether the language lessons make use of the power of observation
chapter viii mental images and ideas as you sit thinking a company of you together your thoughts run in many diverse lines
yet with all this diversity your minds possess this common characteristic
though your thinking all takes place in what we call the present moment it goes on largely in terms of past experiences
the part played by past experience present thinking depends on past images or ideas of things you have seen or heard or felt of things you have thought of before and which now recur to you of things you remember such as names dates places events of things that you do not remember as a part of your past at all but that belong to it nevertheless these are the things which form a large part of your mental stream and which give content to your thinking
you may think of a thing that is going on now or of one that is to occur in the future but after all you are dependent on your past experience for the material which you put into your thinking of the present moment
indeed nothing can enter your present thinking which does not link itself to something in your past experience
the savage indian in the primeval forest never thought about killing a deer with a rifle merely by pulling a trigger or of turning a battery of machine guns on his enemies to annihilate them none of these things were related to his past experience hence he could not think in such terms
the present interpreted by the not only can we not think at all except in terms of our past experience but even if we could the present would be meaningless to us for the present is interpreted in the light of the past
the sedate man of affairs who decries athletic sports and has never taken part in them can not understand the wild enthusiasm which prevails between rival teams in a hotly contested event
the fine work of art is to the one who has never experienced the appeal which comes through beauty only so much of canvas and variegated patches of color
paul says that jesus was unto the greeks foolishness
he was foolishness to them because nothing in their experience with their own gods had been enough like the character of jesus to enable them to interpret him
the future also depends on the to the mind incapable of using past experience the future also would be impossible for we can look forward into the future only by placing in its experiences the elements of which we have already known
the savage who has never seen the shining yellow metal does not dream of a heaven whose streets are paved with gold but rather of a happy hunting ground
if you will analyze your own dreams of the future you will see in them familiar pictures perhaps grouped together in new forms but coming in their elements from your past experience nevertheless
all that would remain to a mind devoid of a past would be the little bridge of time which we call the present moment a series of unconnected
thought would be impossible for the mind would have nothing to compare and relate
personality would not exist for personality requires continuity of experience else we should be a new person each succeeding moment without memory and without plans
such a mind would be no mind at all
rank determined by ability to utilize past
so important is past experience in determining our present thinking and guiding our future actions that the place of an individual in the scale of creation is determined largely by the ability to profit by past experience
the scientist tells us of many species of animals now extinct which lost their lives and suffered their race to die out because when long ago the climate began to change and grow much colder they were unable to use the experience of suffering in the last cold season as an incentive to provide shelter or move to a warmer climate against the coming of the next and more rigorous one
man was able to make the adjustment and providing himself with clothing and shelter and food he survived while myriads of the lower forms perished
the singed moth again and again dares the flame which tortures it and at last gives its life a sacrifice to its folly the burned child fears the fire and does not the second time seek the experience
so also can the efficiency of an individual or a nation as compared with other individuals or nations be determined
the inefficient are those who repeat the same error or useless act over and over or else fail to repeat a chance useful act whose repetition might lead to success
they are unable to learn their lesson and be guided by experience
their past does not sufficiently minister to their present and through it direct their future
how past experience is conserved
past experience conserved in both mental and physical if past experience plays so important a part in our welfare how then is it to be conserved so that we may secure its benefits
here as elsewhere we find the mind and body working in perfect unison and harmony each doing its part to further the interests of both
the results of our past experience may be read in both our mental and our physical nature
on the physical side past experience is recorded in modified structure through the law of habit working on the tissues of the body and particularly on the delicate tissues of the brain and nervous system
this is easily seen in its outward aspects
the stooped shoulders and bent form of the workman tell a tale of physical toil and exposure the bloodless lips and pale face of the victim of the city sweat shop tell of foul air long hours and insufficient food the rosy cheek and bounding step of childhood speak of fresh air good food and happy play
on the mental side past experience is conserved chiefly by means of and
the nature and function of concepts will be discussed in a later chapter
it will now be our purpose to examine the nature of images and ideas and to note the part they play in the mind activities
the image and the to understand the nature of the image and then of the idea we may best go back to the percept
you look at a watch which i hold before your eyes and secure a percept of it
briefly this is what happens the light reflected from the yellow object on striking the retina results in a nerve current which sets up a certain form of activity in the cells of the visual brain area and lo
a of the watch flashes in your mind
now i put the watch in my pocket so that the stimulus is no longer present to your eye
then i ask you to think of my watch just as it appeared as you were looking at it or you may yourself choose to think of it without my suggesting it to you
in either case cellular activity in the visual area of the cortex is approximately as it occurred in connection with the percept and lo
an of the watch flashes in your mind
an image is thus an approximate copy of a former percept or several percepts
it is aroused indirectly by means of a nerve current coming by way of some other brain center instead of directly by the stimulation of a sense organ as in the case of a percept
if instead of seeking a more or less exact mental of my watch you only think of its general and relations the fact that it is of gold that it is for the purpose of keeping time that it was a present to me that i wear it in my left pocket you then have an of the watch
our idea of an object is therefore the general meaning of relations we ascribe to it
it should be remembered however that the terms image and idea are employed rather loosely and that there is not yet general uniformity among writers in their use
all our past experience potentially at our images may in a certain sense take the place of percepts and we can again experience sights sounds tastes and smells which we have known before without having the stimuli actually present to the senses
in this way all our past experience is potentially available to the present
all the objects we have seen it is potentially possible again to see in the mind eye without being obliged to have the objects before us all the sounds we have heard all the tastes and smells and temperatures we have experienced we may again have presented to our minds in the form of mental images without the various stimuli being present to the of the senses
through images and ideas the total number of objects in our experience is infinitely multiplied for many of the things we have seen or heard or smelled or tasted we can not again have present to the senses and without this power we would never get them again
and besides this fact it would be inconvenient to have to go and secure afresh each sensation or percept every time we need to use it in our thought
while then conserves our past experience on the physical side the and the do the same thing on the mental side
individual differences in imagery images to be viewed by the remainder of the description of images will be easier to understand for each of you can know just what is meant in every case by appealing to your own mind
i beg of you not to think that i am presenting something new and strange a curiosity connected with our thinking which has been discovered by scholars who have delved more deeply into the matter than we can hope to do
every day no more than that every hour and every moment these images are flitting through our minds forming a large part of our stream of consciousness
let us see whether we can turn our attention within and discover some of our images in their flight
i know of no better way to proceed than that adopted by francis galton years ago when he asked the english men of letters and science to think of their breakfast tables and then describe the images which appeared
i am about to ask each one of you to do the same thing but i want to warn you beforehand that the images will not be so vivid as the sensory experiences themselves
they will be much fainter and more vague and less clear and definite they will be fleeting and must be caught on the wing
often the image may fade entirely out and the idea only be left
the varied imagery suggested by one dining let each one now recall the dining table as you last left it and then answer questions concerning it like the following can i see clearly in my mind eye the whole table as it stood spread before me
can i see all parts of it equally clearly
do i get the snowy white and gloss of the linen
the delicate coloring of the china so that i can see where the pink shades off into the white
the graceful lines and curves of the dishes
the rich red and dark green of the bouquet of roses
can i again hear the rattle of the dishes
the clink of the spoon against the cup
the chatter of the voices each with its own peculiar pitch and quality
the twitter of a bird outside the window
the chirp of a neighborly cricket
can i get the appetizing odor of the coffee
the perfume of the lilac bush outside the door
the perfume from a handkerchief newly treated to a spray of heliotrope
can i recall the touch of my fingers on the velvety peach
can i get clearly the temperature of the hot coffee in the mouth
of the grateful coolness of the breeze wafted in through the open window
can i feel again the strain of muscle and joint in passing the heavy dish
can i feel the movement of the jaws in chewing the beefsteak
of the throat and lips in talking
of the chest and diaphragm in laughing
of the muscles in sitting and rising
in hand and arm in using knife and fork and spoon
can i get again the sensation of pain which accompanied biting on a tender tooth
from the shooting of a drop of acid from the rind of the orange into the eye
the pleasant feeling connected with the exhilaration of a beautiful morning
the pleasure connected with partaking of a favorite food
power of imagery varies in different it is more than probable that some of you can not get perfectly clear images in all these lines certainly not with equal facility for the imagery from any one sense varies greatly from person to person
a celebrated painter was able after placing his subject in a chair and looking at him attentively for a few minutes to dismiss the subject and paint a perfect likeness of him from the visual image which recurred to the artist every time he turned his eyes to the chair where the sitter had been placed
on the other hand a young lady a student in my psychology class tells me that she is never able to recall the looks of her mother when she is absent even if the separation has been only for a few moments
she can get an image of the form with the color and cut of the dress but never the features
one person may be able to recall a large part of a concert through his auditory imagery and another almost none
in general it may be said that the power or at least the use of imagery decreases with age
the writer has made a somewhat extensive study of the imagery of certain students college students and specialists in psychology averaging middle age
almost without exception it was found that clear and vivid images played a smaller part in the thinking of the older group than of the younger
more or less abstract ideas and concepts seemed to have taken the place of the concrete imagery of earlier years
imagery although there is some difference in our ability to use imagery of different sensory types probably there is less variation here than has been supposed
earlier pedagogical works spoke of the type of mind or the type or the type as if the possession of one kind of imagery necessarily rendered a person short in other types
later studies have shown this view incorrect however
the person who has good images of one type is likely to excel in all types while one who is lacking in any one of the more important types will probably be found short in all  most of us probably make more use of visual and auditory than of other kinds of imagery while olfactory and gustatory images seem to play a minor r√¥le
the function of images binet says that the man who has not every type of imagery almost equally well developed is only the fraction of a man
while this no doubt puts the matter too strongly yet images do play an important part in our thinking
images supply material for imagination and imagery supplies the pictures from which imagination builds its structures
given a rich supply of images from the various senses and imagination has the material necessary to construct times and events long since past or to fill the future with plans or experiences not yet reached
lacking images however imagination is handicapped and its meager products reveal in their barrenness and their lack of warmth and reality the poverty of material
much of our memory also takes the form of images
the face of a friend the sound of a voice or the touch of a hand may be recalled not as a mere fact but with almost the freshness and fidelity of a percept
that much of our memory goes on in the form of ideas instead of images is true
but memory is often both aided in its accuracy and rendered more vital and significant through the presence of abundant imagery
imagery in the thought since logical thinking deals more with relations and meanings than with particular objects images naturally play a smaller part in reasoning than in memory and imagination
yet they have their place here as well
students of geometry or trigonometry often have difficulty in understanding a theorem until they succeed in visualizing the surface or solid involved
thinking in the field of astronomy mechanics and many other sciences is assisted at certain points by the ability to form clear and accurate images
the use of imagery in facility in the use of imagery undoubtedly adds much to our enjoyment and appreciation of certain forms of literature
the great writers commonly use all types of images in their description and narration
if we are not able to employ the images they used many of their most beautiful pictures are likely to be to us but so many words suggesting prosaic ideas
shakespeare describing certain beautiful music appeals to the sense of smell to make himself understood
my ear like the sweet sound that breathes upon a bank of violets stealing and giving odor
here the smell of the blood still all the perfumes of arabia will not sweeten this little hand
milton has say of her dream of the fatal apple
the pleasant smell so quickened appetite that i methought could not but taste
likewise with the sense of touch
i take thy hand this hand as soft as dove down and as white as it
imagine a person devoid of delicate tactile imagery with senseless finger tips and leaden footsteps undertaking to interpret these exquisite lines
thus i set my printless feet the cowslip velvet head that bends not as i tread
shakespeare thus appeals to the muscular imagery at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raised a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being
many passages like the following appeal to the temperature images freeze freeze thou bitter sky
thou dost not bite so nigh as benefits forgot
to one whose auditory imagery is meager the following lines will lose something of their beauty how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank
here we will sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony
note how much clear images will add to browning words are there not two moments in the adventure of a diver one when a beggar he prepares to plunge and one when a prince he rises with his pearl points where images are of greatest beyond question many images come flooding into our minds which are irrelevant and of no service in our thinking
no one has failed to note many such
further we undoubtedly do much of our best thinking with few or no images present
where then are they most needed
images are needed wherever the percepts which they represent would be of service
whatever one could better understand or enjoy or appreciate by seeing it hearing it or perceiving it through some other sense he can better understand enjoy or appreciate through images than by means of ideas only
the cultivation of imagery images depend
on sensory the power of imaging can be cultivated the same as any other ability
in the first place we may put down as an absolute requisite an environment of sensory stimuli as will tempt every sense to be awake and at its that we may be led into a large acquaintance with the objects of our material environment
no one stock of sensory images is greater than the sum total of his sensory experiences
no one ever has images of sights or sounds or tastes or smells which he has never experienced
likewise he must have had the fullest and freest possible liberty in motor activities
for not only is the motor act itself made possible through the office of imagery but the motor act clarifies and makes useful the images
the boy who has actually made a table or a desk or a box has ever afterward a different and a better image of one of these objects than before so also when he has owned and ridden a bicycle his image of this machine will have a different significance from that of the image founded upon the visual perception alone of the wheel he longingly looked at through the store window or in the other boy dooryard
the influence of frequent but sensory experiences and motor responses alone are not enough though they are the basis of good imagery
the sunset may have been never so brilliant and the music never so entrancing but if they are never thought of and dwelt upon after they were first experienced little will remain of them after a very short time
it is by repeating them often in experience through imagery that they become fixed so that they stand ready to do our bidding when we need next to use them
the reconstruction of our to richness of experience and frequency of the recall of our images we must add one more factor namely that of their or working over
few if any images are exact recalls of former percepts of objects
indeed such would be neither possible nor desirable
the images which we recall are recalled for a purpose or in view of some future activity and hence must be or made up of the elements of several or many former related images
thus the boy who wishes to construct a box without a pattern to follow recalls the images of numerous boxes he may have seen and from them all he has a new image made over from many former percepts and images and this new image serves him as a working model
in this way he not only gets a copy which he can follow to make his box but he also secures a new product in the form of an image different from any he ever had before and is therefore by so much the richer
it is this working over of our stock of old images into new and richer and more suggestive ones that constitutes the essence of constructive imagination
the more types of imagery into which we can put our thought the more fully is it ours and the better our images
the spelling lesson needs not only to be taken in through the eye that we may retain a visual image of the words but also to be recited orally so that the ear may furnish an auditory image and the organs of speech a motor image of the correct forms
it needs also to be written and thus given into the keeping of the hand which finally needs most of all to know and retain it
the reading lesson should be taken in through both the eye and the ear and then expressed by means of voice and gesture in as full and complete a way as possible that it may be associated with motor images
the geography lesson needs not only to be read but to be drawn or molded or constructed
the history lesson should be made to appeal to every possible form of imagery
the arithmetic lesson must be not only computed but measured weighed and pressed into actual service
thus we might carry the illustration into every line of education and experience and the same truth holds
what we desire to comprehend completely and retain well we must apprehend through all available senses and conserve in every possible type of image and form of expression
observe a reading class and try to determine whether the pupils picture the scenes and events they read about
similarly observe a history class
do the pupils realize the events as actually happening and the personages as real living people
observe in a similar way a class in geography and draw conclusions
a pupil in computing the cost of plastering a certain room based the figures on the room full of
how might visual imagery have saved the error
then saw it up into inch cubes leaving them all standing in the original form
how many inch cubes have paint on three faces
answer all these questions by referring to your imagery alone
try often to recall images in the various sensory lines determine in what classes of images you are least proficient and try to improve in these lines
how is the singing teacher able after his class has sung through several scores to tell that they are flatting
study your imagery carefully for a few days to see whether you can discover your predominating type of imagery
everyone desires to have a good imagination yet not all would agree as to what constitutes a good imagination
if i were to ask a group of you whether you have good imaginations many of you would probably at once fall to considering whether you are capable of taking wild flights into impossible realms of thought and evolving unrealities out of airy nothings
you would compare yourself with great imaginative writers such as stevenson poe de quincey and judge your power of imagination by your ability to produce such tales as made them famous
the place of imagination in mental economy but such a measure for the imagination as that just stated is far too narrow
a good imagination like a good memory is the one which serves its owner best
if dequincey and poe and stevenson and bulwer found the type which led them into such dizzy flights the best for their particular purpose well and good but that is not saying that their type is the best for you or that you may not rank as high in some other field of imaginative power as they in theirs
while you may lack in their particular type of imagination they may have been short in the type which will one day make you famous
the artisan the architect the merchant the artist the farmer the teacher the professional man all need imagination in their vocations not less than the writers need it in theirs but each needs a specialized kind adapted to the particular work which he has to do
practical nature of imagination is not a process of thought which must deal chiefly with unrealities and impossibilities and which has for its chief end our amusement when we have nothing better to do than to follow its wanderings
it is rather a commonplace necessary process which illumines the way for our everyday thinking and acting a process without which we think and act by haphazard chance or blind imitation
it is the process by which the images from our past experiences are marshaled and made to serve our present
imagination looks into the future and constructs our patterns and lays our plans
it sets up our ideals and pictures us in the acts of achieving them
it enables us to live our joys and our sorrows our victories and our defeats before we reach them
it looks into the past and allows us to live with the kings and seers of old or it goes back to the beginning and we see things in the process of the making
it comes into our present and plays a part in every act from the simplest to the most complex
it is to the mental stream what the light is to the traveler who carries it as he passes through the darkness while it casts its beams in all directions around him lighting up what otherwise would be intolerable gloom
imagination in the interpretation of history literature and let us see some of the most common uses of the imagination
suppose i describe to you the battle of the marne
unless you can take the images which my words suggest and build them into struggling shouting bleeding soldiers into forts and entanglements and breastworks into roaring cannon and whistling bullet and screaming shell unless you can take all these separate images and out of them get one great unified complex then my description will be to you only so many words largely without content and you will lack the power to comprehend the historical event in any complete way
unless you can read the poem and out of the images suggested by the words reconstruct the picture which was in the mind of the author as he wrote the village blacksmith or snowbound the significance will have dropped out and the throbbing scenes of life and action become only so many dead words like the shell of the chrysalis after the butterfly has left its shroud
without the power of imagination the history of washington winter at valley forge becomes a mere formal recital and you can never get a view of the tents the landscape the tracks in the snow marked by the telltale drops of blood or the form of the heartbroken commander as he kneels in the silent wood to pray for his army
without the power to construct this picture as you read you may commit the words and be able to recite them and to pass examination upon them but the living reality of it will forever escape you
your power of imagination determines your ability to interpret literature of all kinds for the interpretation of literature is nothing after all but the reconstruction on our part of the pictures with their meanings which were in the mind of the writer as he penned the words and the experiencing of the emotions which moved him as he wrote
small use indeed to read the history of the centuries unless we can see in it living acting people and real events occurring in actual environments
small use to read the world great books unless their characters are to us real men and women our brothers and sisters interpreted to us by the master minds of the ages
anything less than this and we are no longer dealing with literature but with words like musical sounds which deal with no theme or like picture frames in which no picture has been set
nor is the case different in listening to a speaker
his words are to you only so many sensations of sounds of such and such pitches and intensities and quality unless your mind keeps pace with his and continually builds the pictures which fill his thought as he speaks
lacking imagination the sculptures of michael angelo and the pictures of raphael are to you so many pieces of curiously shaped marble and ingeniously colored canvas
what the sculptor and the painter have placed before you must suggest to you images and thoughts from your own experience to fill out and make alive the marble and the canvas else to you they are dead
imagination and nor is imagination less necessary in other lines of study
without this power of building living moving pictures out of images there is small use to study science beyond what is immediately present to our senses for some of the most fundamental laws of science rest upon conceptions which can be grasped only as we have the power of imagination
the student who can not get a picture of the molecules of matter infinitely close to each other and yet never touching all in vibratory motion yet each within its own orbit each a complete unit in itself yet capable of still further division into smaller particles the student who can not see all this in a clear visual image can never at best have more than a most hazy notion of the theory of matter
and this means finally that the explanations of light and heat and sound and much besides will be to him largely a jumble of words which linger in his memory perchance but which never vitally become a possession of his mind
so with the world of the telescope
you may have at your disposal all the magnificent lenses and the accurate machinery owned by modern observatories but if you have not within yourself the power to build what these reveal to you and what the books tell you into the solar system and still larger systems you can never study astronomy except in a blind and piecemeal sort of way and all the planets and satellites and suns will never for you form themselves into a system no matter what the books may say about it
but we may consider a still more practical phase of imagination or at least one which has more to do with the humdrum daily life of most of us
suppose you go to your milliner and tell her how you want your spring hat shaped and trimmed
and suppose you have never been able to see this hat in your mind so as to get an idea of how it will look when completed but have only a general notion because you like red velvet white plumes and a rim that this combination will look well together
suppose you have never been able to see how you would look in this particular hat with your hair done in this or that way
if you are in this helpless state shall you not have to depend finally on the taste of the milliner or accept the model and so fail to reveal any taste or individuality on your own part
how many times have you been disappointed in some article of dress because when you planned it you were unable to see it all at once so as to get the full effect or else you could not see yourself in it and so be able to judge whether it suited you
how many homes have in them draperies and rugs and wall paper and furniture which are in constant quarrel because someone could not see before they were assembled that they were never intended to keep company
how many people who plan their own houses would build them just the same again after seeing them completed
the man who can see a building complete before a brick has been laid or a timber put in place who can see it not only in its details one by one as he runs them over in his mind but can see the building in its entirety is the only one who is safe to plan the structure
and this is the man who is drawing a large salary as an architect for imaginations of this kind are in demand
only the one who can see in his mind eye before it is begun the thing he would create is capable to plan its construction
and who will say that ability to work with images of these kinds is not of just as high a type as that which results in the construction of plots upon which stories are built
the building of ideals and nor is the part of imagination less marked in the formation of our life ideals and plans
everyone who is not living blindly and aimlessly must have some ideal some pattern by which to square his life and guide his actions
at some time in our life i am sure that each of us has selected the person who filled most nearly our notion of what we should like to become and measured ourselves by this pattern
but there comes a time when we must idealize even the most perfect individual when we invest the character with attributes which we have selected from some other person and thus worship at a shrine which is partly real and partly ideal
as time goes on we drop out more and more of the strictly individual element adding correspondingly more of the ideal until our pattern is largely a construction of our own imagination having in it the best we have been able to glean from the many characters we have known
how large a part these ideals play in our lives we shall never know but certainly the part is not an insignificant one
and happy the youth who is able to look into the future and see himself approximating some worthy ideal
he has caught a vision which will never allow him to lag or falter in the pursuit of the flying goal which points the direction of his efforts
imagination and another great field for imagination is with reference to conduct and our relations with others
over and over again the thoughtless person has to say i am sorry i did not think
the did not think simply means that he failed to realize through his imagination what would be the consequences of his rash or unkind words
he would not be unkind but he did not imagine how the other would feel he did not put himself in the other place
likewise with reference to the effects of our conduct on ourselves
what youth taking his first drink of liquor would continue if he could see a clear picture of himself in the gutter with bloated face and bloodshot eyes a decade hence
or what boy slyly smoking one of his early cigarettes would proceed if he could see his haggard face and nerveless hand a few years farther along
what spendthrift would throw away his money on vanities could he vividly see himself in penury and want in old age
what prodigal anywhere who if he could take a good look at himself and broken as he returns to his father house after the years of debauchery in the far country would not hesitate long before he entered upon his downward career
imagination and we have already considered the use of imagination in interpreting the thoughts feelings and handiwork of others
let us now look a little more closely into the part it plays in our own thinking
suppose that instead of reading a poem we are writing one instead of listening to a description of a battle we are describing it instead of looking at the picture we are painting it
then our object is to make others who may read our language or listen to our words or view our handiwork construct the mental images of the situation which furnished the material for our thought
our words and other modes of expression are but the description of the flow of images in our minds and our problem is to make a similar stream flow through the mind of the listener but strange indeed would it be to make others see a situation which we ourselves can not see strange if we could draw a picture without being able to follow its outlines as we draw
or suppose we are teaching science and our object is to explain the composition of matter to someone and make him understand how light heat depend on the theory of matter strange if the listener should get a picture if we ourselves are unable to get it
or once more suppose we are to describe some incident and our aim is to make its every detail stand out so clearly that no one can miss a single one
is it not evident that we can never make any of these images more clear to those who listen to us or read our words than they are to ourselves
what is the material the mental content out of which imagination builds its structures
images the stuff of nothing can enter the imagination the elements of which have not been in our past experience and then been conserved in the form of images
the indians never dreamed of a heaven whose streets are paved with gold and in whose center stands a great white throne
their experience had given them no knowledge of these things and so perforce they must build their heaven out of the images which they had at command namely those connected with the chase and the forest
so their heaven was the happy hunting ground inhabited by game and enemies over whom the blessed forever triumphed
likewise the valiant soldiers whose deadly arrows and swords and won on the bloody field of hastings did not picture a day when the opposing lines should kill each other with mighty engines hurling death from behind parapets a dozen miles away
firearms and the explosive powder were yet unknown hence there were no images out of which to build such a picture
i do not mean that your imagination can not construct an object which has never before been in your experience as a whole for the work of the imagination is to do precisely this thing
it takes the various images at its disposal and builds them into which may never have existed before and which may exist now only as a creation of the mind
and yet we have put into this new product not a single which was not familiar to us in the form of an image of one kind or another
it is the which is new the is old
this is exemplified every time an inventor takes the two fundamental parts of a machine the
and the and puts them together in relations new to each other and so evolves a machine whose complexity fairly bewilders us
and with other lines of thinking as in mechanics inventive power consists in being able to see the old in new relations and so constantly build new constructions out of old material
it is this power which gives us the daring and original thinker the newton whose falling apple suggested to him the planets falling toward the sun in their orbits the darwin who out of the thigh bone of an animal was able to construct in his imagination the whole animal and the environment in which it must have lived and so add another page to the earth history
the two factors in from the simple facts which we have just been considering the conclusion is plain that our power of imagination depends on two factors namely
the materials available in the form of usable images capable of and  constructive or the power to group these images into new the process being guided by some purpose or
without this last provision the products of our imagination are daydreams with their castles in spain which may be pleasing and proper enough on occasions but which as an habitual mode of thought are extremely dangerous
imagination limited by stock of that the mind is limited in its imagination by its stock of images may be seen from a simple illustration suppose that you own a building made of brick but that you find the old one no longer adequate for your needs and so purpose to build a new one and suppose further that you have no material for your new building except that contained in the old structure
it is evident that you will be limited in constructing your new building by the material which was in the old
you may be able to build the new structure in any one of a multitude of different forms or styles of architecture so far as the material at hand will lend itself to that style of building and providing further that you are able to make the plans
but you will always be limited finally by the character and amount of material obtainable from the old structure
the old building is your past experience and the separate bricks are the images out of which you must build your new structure through the imagination
here as before nothing can enter which was not already on hand
nothing goes into the new structure so far as its constructive material is concerned except images and there is nowhere to get images but from the results of our past experience
also by our constructive but not only is our imaginative output limited by the of material in the way of images which we have at our command but also and perhaps not less by our
many persons might own the old pile of bricks fully adequate for the new structure and then fail to get the new because they were unable to construct it
so many who have had a rich and varied experience in many lines are yet unable to muster their images of these experiences in such a way that new products are obtainable from them
these have the heavy kind of intellect which goes plodding on very possibly doing good service in its own circumscribed range but destined after all to service in the narrow field with its low drooping horizon
they are never able to take a dash at a clip among equally swift competitors or even swing at a good round pace along the pleasant highways of an experience lying beyond the confines of the narrow and
these are the minds which can not discover relations which can not
minds of this type can never be architects of their own fate or even builders but must content themselves to be hod carriers
the need of a nor are we to forget that we can not intelligently erect our building until we know the for which it is to be used
no matter how much building material we may have on hand nor how skillful an architect we may be unless our plans are guided by some definite aim we shall be likely to end with a structure that is fanciful and useless
likewise with our thought structure
unless our imagination is guided by some aim or purpose we are in danger of drifting into mere daydreams which not only are useless in furnishing ideals for the guidance of our lives but often become positively harmful when grown into a habit
the habit of daydreaming is hard to break and continuing holds our thought in thrall and makes it unwilling to deal with the plain homely things of everyday life
who has not had the experience of an hour or a day spent in a fairyland of dreams and awakened at the end to find himself rather dissatisfied with the prosaic round of duties which confronted him
i do not mean to say that we should dream but i know of no more pernicious mental habit than that of daydreaming carried to excess for it ends in our following every of fancy and places us at the mercy of every chance suggestion
although imagination enters every field of human experience and busies itself with every line of human interest yet all its activities can be classed under two different types
reproductive reproductive imagination is the type we use when we seek to reproduce in our minds the pictures described by others or pictures from our own past experience which lack the completeness and fidelity to make them true memory
the narration or description of the story book the history or geography text the tale of adventure recounted by traveler or hunter the account of a new machine or other invention fairy tales and myths these or any other matter that may be put into words capable of suggesting images to us are the field for reproductive imagination
in this use of the imagination our business is to follow and not lead to copy and not create
but we must have leaders originators else we should but imitate each other and the world would be at a standstill
indeed every person no matter how humble his station or how humdrum his life should be in some degree capable of initiative and originality
such ability depends in no small measure on the power to use creative imagination
creative imagination takes the images from our own past experience or those gleaned from the work of others and puts them together in new and original forms
the inventor the writer the mechanic or the artist who possesses the spirit of creation is not satisfied with reproduction but seeks to modify to improve to originate
true many important inventions and discoveries have come by seeming accident by being stumbled upon
yet it holds that the person who thus stumbles upon the discovery or invention is usually one whose creative imagination is actively at work to create or discover in his field
the world progress as a whole does not come by accident but by creative planning
creative imagination is always found at the van of progress whether in the life of an individual or a nation
training the imagination imagination is highly susceptible of cultivation and its training should constitute one of the most important aims of education
every school subject but especially such subjects as deal with description and narration history literature geography nature study and science is rich in opportunities for the use of imagination
skillful teaching will not only find in these subjects a means of training the imagination but will so employ imagination in their study as to make them living matter throbbing with life and action rather than so many dead words or uninteresting facts
gathering of material for theoretically then it is not hard to see what we must do to cultivate our imagination
in the first place we must take care to secure a large and usable of from all fields of perception
it is not enough to have visual images alone or chiefly for many a time shall we need to build structures involving all the other senses and the motor activities as well
this means that we must have a contact with just as large an environment as possible large in the world of nature with all her varied forms suited to appeal to every avenue of sense large in our contact with people in all phases of experience laughing with those who laugh and weeping with those who weep large in contact with books the interpreters of the men and events of the past
we must not only let all these kinds of environment drift in upon us as they may chance to do but we must deliberately to increase our stock of experience for after all experience lies at the bottom of imagination as of every other mental process
and not only must we thus put ourselves in the way of acquiring new experience but we must by recall and reconstruction as we saw in an earlier discussion keep our imagery fresh and usable
for whatever serves to improve our images at the same time is bettering the very foundation of imagination
we must not fail to in the second place we must not fail
for it is futile to gather a large supply of images if we let the material lie unused
how many people there are who put in all their time gathering material for their structure and never take time to do the building
they look and listen and read and are so fully occupied in absorbing the immediately present that they have no time to see the wider significance of the things with which they deal
they are like the students who are too busy studying to have time to think
they are so taken up with receiving that they never perform the higher act of combining
they are the plodding fact gatherers many of them doing good service collecting material which the seer and the philosopher with their constructive power build together into the greater wholes which make our systems of thought
they are the ones who fondly think that by reading books full of wild tales and impossible plots they are training their imagination
for them sober history no matter how heroic or tragic in its quiet movements is too tame
they have not the patience to read solid and thoughtful literature and works of science and philosophy are a bore
these are the persons who put in all their time in looking at and admiring other people houses and never get time to do any building for themselves
we should carry our ideals into the best training for the imagination which i know anything about
is that to be obtained by taking our own material and from it building our own structure
it is true that it will help to look through other people houses enough to discover their style of building we should read
but just as it is not necessary for us to put in all the time we devote to looking at houses in inspecting doll houses and chinese pagodas so it is not best for us to get all our notions of imaginative structures from the marvelous and the unreal we get good training for the imagination from reading hiawatha but so can we from reading the history of the primitive indian tribes
the pictures in snowbound are full of suggestion for the imagination but so is the history of the puritans in new england
but even with the best of models before us it is not enough to follow others ' building
we must construct stories for ourselves must work out plots for our own stories we must have time to meditate and plan and build not idly in the daydream but purposefully and then make our images real by them out in if they are of such a character that this is possible we must build our ideals and work to them in the common course of our everyday life we must think for ourselves instead of forever following the thinking of others we must as well as imitate

chapter x association whence came the thought that occupies you this moment and what determines the next that is to follow
introspection reveals no more interesting fact concerning our minds than that our thoughts move in a connected and orderly array and not in a fashion
our mental states do not throng the stream of consciousness like so many pieces of wood following each other at random down a rushing current now this one ahead now that
on the contrary our thoughts come one after the other as they are beckoned or
the thought now in the focal point of your consciousness appeared because it sprouted out of the one just preceding it and the present thought before it departs will determine its successor and lead it upon the scene
this is to say that our thought stream possesses not only a continuity but also a it has coherence and system
this coherence and system which operates in accordance with definite laws is brought about by what the psychologist calls
we may define association then as the tendency among our thoughts to form such a system of bonds with each other that the objects of consciousness are vitally connected both  as they exist at any given moment and  as they occur in succession in the mental stream
the neural basis of the association of thoughts ideas images memory or of a situation with its response rests primarily on a neural basis
association is the result of habit working in neurone groups
its fundamental law is stated by james as follows when two elementary have been active together or in immediate succession one of them on recurring tends to propagate its excitement into the other
this is but a technical statement of the simple fact that nerve currents flow most easily over the neurone connections that they have already used
it is hard to teach an old dog new tricks because the old tricks employ familiar neural paths while new tricks require the connecting up of groups of neurones not in the habit of working together and the flow of nerve energy is more easily accomplished in the neurones accustomed to working together
one who learns to speak a foreign language late in life never attains the facility and ease that might have been reached at an earlier age
this is because the neural paths for speech are already set for his and with the lessened plasticity of age the new paths are hard to establish
the connections between the various brain areas or groups of neurones are as we have seen in an earlier chapter accomplished by means of
this function requires millions of neurones which unite every part of the cortex with every other part thus making it possible for a neural activity going on in any particular center to extend to any other center whatsoever
in the relatively unripe brain of the child the association fibers have not yet set up most of their connections
the age at which memory begins is determined chiefly by the development of a sufficient number of association fibers to bring about recall
the more complex reasoning which requires many different associative connections is impossible prior to the existence of adequate neural development
it is this fact that makes it futile to attempt to teach young children the more complicated processes of arithmetic grammar or other subjects
they are not yet equipped with the requisite brain machinery to grasp the necessary associations
diagrammatic scheme of association in which v stands for the visual a for the auditory g for the gustatory m for the motor and t for the thought and feeling centers of the cortex
association the basis of without the machinery and processes of association
let us see in a simple illustration how association works in recall
suppose you are passing an orchard and see a tree loaded with tempting apples
you hesitate then climb the fence pick an apple and eat it hearing the owner dog bark as you leave the place
the accompanying diagram will illustrate roughly the centers of the cortex which were involved in the act and the association fibers which connect them
now let us see how you may afterward remember the circumstance through association
let us suppose that a week later you are seated at your dining table and that you begin to eat an apple whose flavor reminds you of the one which you plucked from the tree
from this start how may the entire circumstance be recalled
remember that the cortical centers connected with the sight of the apple tree with our thoughts about it with our movements in getting the apple and with hearing the dog bark were all active together with the taste center and hence tend to be thrown into activity again from its activity
it is easy to see that we may  get a visual image of the apple tree and its fruit from a current over the association fibers  the thoughts emotions or deliberations which we had on the former occasion may again recur to us from a current over the neurones  we may get an image of our movements in climbing the fence and picking the apple from a current over the fibers or  we may get an auditory image of the barking of the dog from a current over the fibers
indeed we are to get some one or more of these unless the paths are blocked in some way or our attention leads off in some other direction
factors determining direction of of these we get first which of the images the taste percept calls to take its place as it drops out of consciousness will depend other things being equal on which center was most keenly active in the original situation and is at the moment most permeable
if at the time we were eating the stolen fruit our thoughts were keenly for taking the apples without permission then the current will probably discharge through the path and we shall recall these thoughts and their accompanying feelings
but if it chances that the barking of the dog frightened us badly then more likely the discharge from the taste center will be along the path and we shall get the auditory image of the dog barking which in turn may call up a visual image of his savage appearance over the fibers
it is clear however that given any one of the elements of the entire situation back the rest are potentially possible to us and any one may serve as a cue to call up all the rest
whether given the starting point we get them all depends solely on whether the paths are sufficiently open between them for the current to discharge between them granting that the first experience made sufficient impression to be retained
since this simple illustration may be made infinitely complex by means of the millions of fibers which connect every center in the cortex with every other center and since in passing from one experience to another in the round of our daily activities these various areas are all involved in an endless chain of activities so intimately related that each one can finally lead to all the others we have here the machinery both of retention and of recall the mechanism by which our past may be made to serve the present through being reproduced in the form of memory images or ideas
through this machinery we are unable to escape our past whether it be good or bad for both the good and the bad alike are brought back to us through its operations
when the repetition of a series of acts has rendered habit secure the association is relatively certain
if i recite to you your thought at once runs on to e f g
if i repeat tell me not in mournful numbers association leads you to follow with life is but an empty dream
your neurone groups are accustomed to act in this way so the sequence follows
memorizing anything from the multiplication table to the most beautiful gems of poetic fervor consists therefore in the setting up of the right associative connections in the brain
association in all thinking proceeds by the discovery or recognition of relations between the terms or objects of our thought
the science of mathematics rests on the relations found to exist between numbers and quantities
the principles and laws of natural science are based on the relations established among the different forms of matter and the energy that operates in this field
so also in the realm of history art ethics or any other field of human experience
each fact or event must be linked to other facts or events before it possesses significance
association therefore lies at the foundation of all thinking whether that of the original thinker who is creating our sciences planning and executing the events of history evolving a system of ethics or whether one is only learning these fields as they already exist by means of study
other things being equal he is the best thinker who has his knowledge related part to part so that the whole forms a unified and usable system
association and association plays an equally important part in all our motor responses the acts by which we carry on our daily lives do our work and our play or whatever else may be necessary in meeting and adapting ourselves to our environment
some sensations are often repeated and demand practically the same response each time
in such cases the associations soon become fixed and the response certain and automatic
for example we sit at the table and the response of eating follows with all its complex acts as a matter of course
we lie down in bed and the response of sleep comes
we take our place at the piano and our fingers produce the accustomed music
it is of course obvious that the influence of association extends to moral action as well
in general our conduct follows the trend of established associations
we are likely to do in great moral crises about as we are in the habit of doing in small ones
the types of association fundamental law of stated on the physiological side the law of habit as set forth in the definition of association in the preceding section includes all the laws of association
in different phrasing we may say  neurone groups accustomed to acting together have the tendency to work in unison
the more frequently such groups act together the stronger will be the tendency for one to throw the other into action
also  the more intense the excitement or tension under which they act together the stronger will be the tendency for activity in one to bring about activity in the other
the corresponding facts may be expressed in psychological terms as follows  facts accustomed to being associated together in the mind have a tendency to reappear together
the more frequently these facts appear together the stronger the tendency for the presence of one to insure the presence of the other
the greater the tension excitement or concentration when these facts appear in conjunction with each other the more certain the presence of one is to cause the presence of the other
several different types of association have been differentiated by psychologists from aristotle down
it is to be kept in mind however that all association types back to the elementary law of among the for their explanation
by the recurrence in our minds of many of the elements from our past experience is due to the fact that at some time possibly at many times the recurring facts were contiguous in consciousness with some other element or fact which happens now to be again present
all have had the experience of meeting some person whom we had not seen for several months or years and having a whole series of supposedly forgotten incidents or events connected with our former associations flood into the mind
things we did topics we discussed trips we took games we played now recur at the renewal of our acquaintance
for these are the things that were contiguous in our consciousness with our sense of the personality and appearance of our friend
and who has not in similar fashion had a whiff of perfume or the strains of a song recall to him his childhood days
contiguity is again the explanation
at the mercy of our through the law thus operating we are in a sense at the mercy of our associations which may be bad as well as good
we may form certain lines of interest to guide our thought and attention may in some degree direct it but one mental is after all largely dependent on the character of his associations
evil thoughts evil memories evil imaginations these all come about through the association of unworthy or impure images along with the good in our stream of thought
we may try to forget the base deed and banish it forever from our thinking but lo
in an unguarded moment the nerve current shoots into the old path and the impure thought flashes into the mind unsought and unwelcomed
every young man who thinks he must indulge in a little sowing of wild oats before he settles down to a correct life and so deals in unworthy thoughts and deeds is putting a mortgage on his future for he will find the inexorable machinery of his nervous system grinding the hated images of such things back into his mind as surely as the mill returns to the sack of the miller what he feeds into the hopper
he may refuse to harbor these thoughts but he can no more hinder their seeking admission to his mind than he can prevent the tramp from knocking at his door
he may drive such images from his mind the moment they are discovered and indeed is guilty if he does not but not taking offense at this rebuff the unwelcome thought again seeks admission
the only protection against the return of the undesirable associations is to choose lines of thought as little related to them as possible
but even then do the best we may an occasional connection will be set up we know not how and the unwelcome image stands staring us in the face as the corpse of eugene aram victim confronted him at every turn though he thought it safely buried
a minister of my acquaintance tells me that in the holiest moments of his most exalted thought images rise in his mind which he loathes and from which he recoils in horror
not only does he drive them away at once but he seeks to lock and bar the door against them by firmly resolving that he will never think of them again
the tares have been sown among the wheat and will persist along with it until the end
in his boyhood these images were given into the keeping of his brain cells and they are only being faithful to their trust
association by similarity and all are familiar with the fact that like tends to suggest like
one friend reminds us of another friend when he manifests similar traits of character shows the same tricks of manner or has the same peculiarities of speech or gesture
the telling of a ghost or burglar story in a company will at once suggest a similar story to every person of the group and before we know it the conversation has settled down to ghosts or burglars
one boastful boy is enough to start the gang to recounting their real or imaginary exploits
good and beautiful thoughts tend to call up other good and beautiful thoughts while evil thoughts are likely to produce after their own kind like produces like
another form of relationship is however quite as common as similars in our thinking
in certain directions we naturally think in
black suggests white good suggests bad fat suggests lean wealth suggests poverty happiness suggests sorrow and so on
the tendency of our thought thus to group in similars and opposites is clear when we go back to the fundamental law of association
the fact is that we more frequently assemble our thoughts in these ways than in haphazard relations
we habitually group similars together or compare opposites in our thinking hence these are the terms between which associative bonds are formed
partial or selective the past is never wholly reinstated in present consciousness
many elements because they had formed fewer associations or because they find some obstacle to recall are permanently dropped out and forgotten
in other words association is always favoring now this item of experience now that above the rest
it is well that this is so for to be unable to escape from the great mass of minuti√¶ and unimportant detail in one past would be intolerable and would so cumber the mind with useless rubbish as to destroy its usefulness
we have surely all had some experience with the type of persons whose associations are so complete and impartial that all their conversation teems with unessential and irrelevant details
they can not recount the simplest incident in its essential points but slaves to literalness make themselves insufferable bores by entering upon every lane and of circumstance that leads nowhere and matters not the least in their story
dickens thackeray george eliot shakespeare and many other writers have seized upon such characters and made use of them for their comic effect
james in illustrating this mental type has quoted the following from miss austen emma where could hear it ' cried miss bates
could you possibly hear it knightley
for it is not five minutes since i received cole note no it can not be more than five or at least ten for i had got my bonnet and spencer on just ready to come out i was only gone down to speak to patty again about the pork jane was standing in the passage were not you jane for my mother was so afraid that we had not any large enough
so i said i would go down and see and jane said shall i go down instead
for i think you have a little cold and patty has been washing the kitchen
oh my dear said i well and just then came the note '
the the remedy for such wearisome and fruitless methods of association is as a matter of theory simple and easy
it is to emphasize intensify and dwell upon the and in our thinking
the person who listens to a story who studies a lesson or who is a participant in any event must apply a of recognizing and fixing the important and relegating the trivial and unimportant to their proper level
not to train one self to think in this discriminating way is much like learning to play a piano by striking each key with equal force
since association is at bottom nothing but habit at work in the mental processes it follows that it like other forms of habit can be encouraged or suppressed by training
certainly no part of one education is of greater importance than the character of his associations
for upon these will largely depend not alone the of his mental stream the stuff of his thinking but also its or the use made of the thought material at hand
in fact the whole science of education rests on the laws and principles involved in setting up right systems of associative connections in the individual
the motive in a general law seems to obtain throughout the animal world that associative responses accompanied by pleasure tend to persist and grow stronger while those accompanied by pain tend to weaken and fall away
the little child of two years may not understand the gravity of the offense in tearing the leaves out of books but if its hands are sharply spatted whenever they tear a book the association between the sight of books and tearing them will soon cease
in fact all punishment should have for its object the use of pain in the breaking of associative bonds between certain situations and wrong responses to them
on the other hand the dog that is being trained to perform his tricks is rewarded with a tidbit or a pat when the right response has been made
in this way the bond for this particular act is strengthened through the use of pleasure
all matter studied and learned under the stimulus of good feeling enthusiasm or a pleasurable sense of victory and achievement not only tends to set up more permanent and valuable associations than if learned under opposite conditions but it also exerts a stronger appeal to our interest and appreciation
the influence of mental attitude on the matter we study raises a question as to the wisdom of assigning the committing of poetry or bible verses or the reading of so many pages of a literary masterpiece as a punishment for some offense
how many of us have carried away associations of dislike and bitterness toward some gem of verse or prose or scripture because of having our learning of it linked up with the thought of an imposed task set as penance for
one person tells me that to this day she hates the sight of tennyson because this was the volume from which she was assigned many pages to commit in atonement for her youthful delinquencies interest as a basis for associations established under the stimulus of strong interest are relatively broad and permanent while those formed with interest flagging are more narrow and of doubtful permanence
this statement is of course but a particular application of the law of attention
interest brings the whole self into action
under its urging the mind is active and alert
the new facts learned are completely registered and are assimilated to other facts to which they are related
many associative connections are formed hence the new matter is more certain of recall and possesses more significance and meaning
association and methods of the number and quality of our associations depends in no small degree on our methods of learning
we may be satisfied merely to impress what we learn on our memory committing it uncritically as so many facts to be stored away as a part of our education
we may go a step beyond this and grasp the simplest and most obvious meanings but not seek for the deeper and more fundamental relations
we may learn separate sections or divisions of a subject accepting each as a more or less complete unit without connecting these sections and divisions into a logical whole
but all such methods are a mistake
they do not provide for the associative bonds between the various facts or groups of facts in our knowledge without which our facts are in danger of becoming but so much lumber in the mind
meanings relations definitely recognized associations should attach to all that we learn
better far a smaller amount of knowledge than any quantity of unorganized and undigested information even if the latter sometimes allows us to pass examinations and receive honor grades
in short real mastery demands that we that is and instead of merely
test the uncontrolled associations of a group of pupils by pronouncing to the class some word as and having the members write down  words in succession as rapidly as they can taking in each instance the first word that occurs to them
the difference in the scope or range of associations can easily be studied by applying this test to say a fourth grade and an eighth grade and then comparing results
have you ever been puzzled by the appearance in your mind of some fact or incident not thought of before for years
were you able to trace out the associative connection that caused the fact to appear
why are we sometimes unable to recall when we need them facts that we perfectly well know
you have observed that it is possible to be able to spell certain words when they occur in a spelling lesson but to miss them when employing them in composition
it is possible to learn a conjugation or a declension in tabular form and then not be able to use the correct forms of words in speech or writing
relate these facts to the laws of association and recommend a method of instruction that will remove the discrepancy
to test the quickness of association in a class of children copy the following words clearly in a vertical column on a chart have your class all ready at a given signal then display the chart before them for sixty seconds asking them to write down on paper the exact of as many words as possible in one minute
be sure that all know just what they are expected to do
bad inside slow short little soft black dark sad true dislike poor well sorry thick full peace few below enemy
count the number of correct opposites got by each pupil
can you think of garrulous persons among your acquaintance the explanation of whose tiresomeness is that their association is of the instead of the type
watch for such illustrations in conversation and in literature juliet nurse
observe children in the schoolroom for good and poor training in association
have you ever had anything that you otherwise presumably would enjoy rendered distasteful because of unpleasant associations
pass your own methods of learning in review and also inquire into the methods used by children in study to determine whether they are resulting in the best possible use of association
every hour of our lives we call upon memory to supply us with some fact or detail from out our past
let memory wholly fail us and we find ourselves helpless and out of joint in a world we fail to understand
a poor memory handicaps one in the pursuit of education hampers him in business or professional success and puts him at a disadvantage in every relation of life
on the other hand a good memory is an asset on which the owner realizes anew each succeeding day
now that you come to think of it you can recall perfectly well that columbus discovered america in  that your house is painted white that it rained a week ago today
but where were these facts now remembered so easily while they were out of your mind
where did they stay while you were not thinking of them
the common answer is stored away in my memory
yet no one believes that the memory is a warehouse of facts which we pack away there when we for a time have no use for them as we store away our old furniture
what is the truth is that the simple question i asked you is by no means an easy one and i will answer it myself by asking you an easier one as we sit with the sunlight streaming into our room where is the darkness which filled it last night
and where will all this light be at midnight tonight
answer these questions and the ones i asked about your remembered facts will be answered
while it is true that regardless of the conditions in our little room darkness still exists wherever there is no light and light still exists wherever there is no darkness yet for this particular room
there is no darkness when the sun shines and is no light when the room is filled with
so in the case of a remembered fact
although the fact that columbus discovered america some four hundred years ago that your house is of a white color that it rained a week ago today exists as a fact regardless of whether your minds think of these things at all yet the truth remains as before for the particular mind which remembers these things facts did not exist while they were out of the
it is not the remembered fact which is but the power to reproduce the fact when we require it
the physical basis of the power to reproduce a fact depends ultimately on the brain
this is not hard to understand if we go back a little and consider that brain activity was concerned in every perception we have ever had and in every fact we have ever known
indeed it was through a certain neural activity of the cortex that you were able originally to know that columbus discovered america that your house is white and that it rained on a day in the past
without this cortical activity these facts would have existed just as truly but would never have known them
without this neural activity in the brain there is no consciousness and to it we must look for the recurrence in consciousness of remembered facts as well as for those which appear for the first time
how we now if we are to have a fact repeated in consciousness or in other words what we must do on the physiological side is to provide for a repetition of the neural activity which was at first responsible for the fact appearing in consciousness
the mental accompaniment of the repeated activity the
thus as is the approximate repetition of mental states or facts together with the recognition of their belonging to our past so it is accomplished by an approximate repetition of the neural process in the cortex which originally accompanied these states or
the part played by the brain in memory makes it easy to understand why we find it so impossible to memorize or to recall when the brain is fatigued from long hours of work or lack of sleep
it also explains the derangement in memory that often comes from an injury to the brain or from the toxins of alcohol drugs or disease
dependence of memory on brain differences in memory ability while depending in part on the training memory receives rest ultimately on the of the brain
james tells us that four distinct types of brains may be distinguished and he describes them as follows brains that are  like to receive and like to retain
like to receive and like to retain
the first type gives us those who memorize slowly and with much heroic effort but who keep well what they have committed
the second type represents the ones who learn in a flash who can cram up a lesson in a few minutes but who forget as easily and as quickly as they learn
the third type characterizes the unfortunates who must labor hard and long for what they memorize only to see it quickly slipping from their grasp
the fourth type is a rare boon to its possessor enabling him easily to stock his memory with valuable material which is readily available to him upon demand
the particular type of brain we possess is given us through heredity and we can do little or nothing to change the type
whatever our type of brain however we can do much to improve our memory by obeying the laws upon which all good memory depends
the four factors involved in memory nothing is more obvious than that memory can not return to us what has never been given into its keeping what has not been retained or what for any reason can not be recalled
further if the facts given back by memory are not recognized as belonging to our past memory would be incomplete
memory therefore involves the following four factors
by registration we mean the learning or committing of the matter to be remembered
on the brain side this involves producing in the appropriate neurones the activities which when repeated again later cause the fact to be recalled
it is this process that constitutes what we call impressing the facts upon the brain
nothing is more fatal to good memory than partial or faulty registration
a thing but half learned is sure to be forgotten
we often stop in the mastery of a lesson just short of the full impression needed for permanent retention and sure recall
we sometimes say to our teachers i can not remember when as a matter of fact we have never learned the thing we seek to recall
retention as we have already seen resides primarily in the brain
it is accomplished through the law of habit working in the neurones of the cortex
here as elsewhere habit makes an activity once performed more easy of performance each succeeding time
through this law a neural activity once performed tends to be repeated or in other words a fact once known in consciousness tends to be remembered
that so large a part of our past is lost in oblivion and out of the reach of our memory is probably much more largely due to a failure to than to
we say that we have forgotten a fact or a name which we can not recall try as hard as we may yet surely all have had the experience of a fact suddenly appearing in our memory when we had given it up and no longer had use for it
it was retained all the time else it never could have come back at all
an aged man of my acquaintance lay on his deathbed
in his childhood he had first learned to speak german but moving with his family when he was eight or nine years of age to an community he had lost his ability to speak german and had been unable for a third of a century to carry on a conversation in his mother tongue
yet during the last days of his sickness he lost almost wholly the power to use the english language and spoke fluently in german
during all these years his brain paths had retained the power to reproduce the forgotten words even though for so long a time the words could not be recalled
james quotes a still more striking case of an aged woman who was seized with a fever and during her delirious ravings was heard talking in latin hebrew and greek
she herself could neither read nor write and the priests said she was possessed of a devil
but a physician unraveled the mystery
when the girl was nine years of age a pastor who was a noted scholar had taken her into his home as a servant and she had remained there until his death
during this time she had daily heard him read aloud from his books in these languages
her brain had indelibly retained the record made upon it although for years she could not have recalled a sentence if indeed she had ever been able to do so
recall depends entirely on association
there is no way to arrive at a certain fact or name that is eluding us except by means of some other facts names or so related to the missing term as to be able to bring it into the fold
memory arrives at any desired fact only over a bridge of associations
it therefore follows that the more associations set up between the fact to be remembered and related facts already in the mind the more certain the recall
historical dates and events should when learned be associated with important central dates and events to which they naturally attach
geographical names places or other information should be connected with related material already in the mind
scientific knowledge should form a coherent and related whole
in short everything that is given over to the memory for its keeping should be linked as closely as possible to material of the same sort
this is all to say that we should not expect our memory to retain and reproduce isolated unrelated facts but should give it the advantage of as many logical and well grounded associations as possible
a fact reproduced by memory but not recognized as belonging to our past experience would impress us as a new fact
this would mean that memory would fail to link the present to the past
often we are puzzled to know whether we have before met a certain person or on a former occasion told a certain story or previously experienced a certain present state of mind which seems half familiar
such baffling mental states are usually but instances of partial and incomplete recognition
recognition no longer applies to much of our knowledge for example we say we remember that four times six is but probably none of us can recall when and where we learned this fact we can not
it as belonging to our past experience
so with ten thousand other things which we rather than remember in the strict sense
what are the forms in which memory presents the past to us
what are the elements with which it deals
what is the stuff of which it consists
images as the material of in the light of our discussion upon mental imagery and with the aid of a little introspection the answer is easy
i ask you to remember your home and at once a visual image of the familiar house with its rooms and their characteristic furnishings comes to your mind
i ask you to remember the last concert you attended or the chorus of birds you heard recently in the woods and there comes a flood of images partly visual but largely auditory from the melodies you heard
or i ask you to remember the feast of which you partook yesterday and gustatory and olfactory images are prominent among the others which appear
and so i might keep on until i had covered the whole range of your memory and whether i ask you for the simple trivial experiences of your past for the tragic or crucial experiences or for the most abstruse and abstract facts which you know and can recall the case is the same much of what memory presents to you comes in the form of or of of your past
as to we do not all remember what we call the same fact in like images or ideas
when you remembered that columbus discovered america in  some of you had an image of columbus the mariner standing on the deck of his ship as the old picture shows him and accompanying this image was an idea of long agoness
others in recalling the same fact had an image of the coast on which he landed and perchance felt the rocking of the boat and heard it scraping on the sand as it neared the shore
and still others saw on the printed page the words stating that columbus discovered america in
and so in an infinite variety of images or ideas we may remember what we call the same fact though of course the fact is not really the same fact to any two of us nor to any one of us when it comes to us on different occasions in different images
other memory but sensory images are not the only material with which memory has to deal
we may also recall the bare fact that it rained a week ago today without having images of the rain
we may recall that columbus discovered america in  without visual or other images of the event
as a matter of fact we do constantly recall many facts of abstract nature such as mathematical or scientific formul√¶ with no imagery other than that of the words or symbols if indeed these be present
memory may therefore use as its stuff not only images but also a wide range of facts ideas and meanings of all sorts
the development of a good memory depends in no small degree on the closeness with which we follow certain laws
the law of the law of association as we have already seen is fundamental
upon it the whole structure of memory depends
stating this law in neural terms we may say brain areas which are together at the same time tend to establish associative so that when one of them is again active the other is also brought into activity
expressing the same truth in mental terms if two facts or experiences together in and one of them is later recalled it tends to cause the other to appear also
the law of the law of repetition is but a restatement of the law of habit and may be formulated as follows
a certain cortical activity occurs the more easily is its repetition brought about
stating this law in mental terms we may say the more often a fact is recalled in consciousness the easier and more certain the recall becomes
it is upon the law of repetition that reviews and drills to fix things in the memory are based
the law of we may state the law of recency in physiological terms as follows the
brain centers have been employed in a certain activity the more easily are they thrown into the same activity
this on the mental side means the more recently any facts have been present in consciousness the more easily are they recalled
it is in obedience to this law that we want to rehearse a difficult lesson just before the recitation hour or cram immediately before an examination
the working of this law also explains the tendency of all memories to fade out as the years pass by
the law of the law of vividness is of primary importance in memorizing
on the physical side it may be expressed as follows the the or the more intense the activity of neural centers the more easily the activity is repeated
the counterpart of this law in mental terms is
the higher the degree of or concentration when the fact is registered the more certain it is of recall
better far one impression of a high degree of vividness than several repetitions with the attention wandering or the brain too fatigued to respond
not drill alone but drill with concentration is necessary to sure memory in proof of which witness the futile results on the part of the small boy who studies his spelling lesson over fifteen times the while he is at the same time counting his marbles
rules for using the memory much careful and fruitful experimentation in the field of memory has taken place in recent years
the scientists are now able to give us certain simple rules which we can employ in using our memories even if we lack the time or opportunity to follow all their technical discussions
wholes versus probably most people in setting to work to commit to memory a poem oration or other such material have a tendency to learn it first by stanzas or sections and then put the parts together to form the whole
many tests however have shown this to be a less effective method than to go over the whole poem or oration time after time finally giving special attention to any particularly difficult places
the only exception to this rule would seem to be in the case of very long productions which may be broken up into sections of reasonable length
the method of committing by wholes instead of parts not only economizes time and effort in the learning but also gives a better sense of unity and meaning to the matter memorized rate of the rate of forgetting is found to be very much more rapid immediately following the learning than after a longer time has elapsed
this is to say that of what one is going to forget of matter committed to memory approximately will fall away within the first hours and within the first three days
since it is always economy to fix afresh matter that is fading out before it has been wholly forgotten it will manifestly pay to review important memory material within the first day or two after it has once been memorized
divided if to commit a certain piece of material we must go over it say ten different times the results are found to be much better when the entire number of repetitions are not had in immediate succession but with reasonable intervals between
this is due no doubt to the fact that associations tend to take form and grow more secure even after we have ceased to think specifically of the matter in hand
the intervals allow time for the associations to form their connections
it is in this sense that james says we learn to swim during the winter and to skate during the summer
forcing the memory to in committing matter by reading it the memory should be forced into activity just as fast as it is able to carry part of the material
if after reading a poem over once parts of it can be repeated without reference to the text the memory should be compelled to reproduce these parts
should be applied only at such points as the memory has not yet grasped
not a memory but professor james has emphasized the fact which has often been demonstrated by experimental tests that we do not possess a memory but a collection of memories
our memory may be very good in one line and poor in another
nor can we train our memory in the sense of practicing it in one line and having the improvement extend equally to other lines
committing poetry may have little or no effect in strengthening the memory for historical or scientific data
in general the memory must be trained in the specific lines in which it is to excel
general training will not serve except as it may lead to better modes of learning what is to be memorized
what constitutes a good memory let us next inquire what are the qualities which enter into what we call a good memory
the merchant or politician will say ability to remember well people faces and names the teacher of history the ability to recall readily dates and events the teacher of mathematics the power to recall mathematical formul√¶ the hotel waiter the ability to keep in mind orders at a time the manager of a corporation the ability to recall all the necessary details connected with the running of the concern
while these answers are very divergent yet they may all be true for the particular person testifying for out of them all there emerges this common truth that best memory is the one which best serves its
that is one memory not only must be ready and exact but must produce the right kind of material it must bring to us what we need in our thinking
a very easy corollary at once grows out of this fact namely that in order to have the memory return to us the right kind of matter we must store it with the right kind of images and ideas for the memory can not give back to us anything which we have not first given into its keeping
a good memory selects its the best memory is not necessarily the one which impartially repeats the largest number of facts of past experience
everyone has many experiences which he never needs to have reproduced in memory useful enough they may have been at the time but wholly useless and irrelevant later
they have served their purpose and should henceforth slumber in oblivion
they would be but so much rubbish and lumber if they could be recalled
everyone has surely met that particular type of bore whose memory is so faithful to details that no incident in the story he tells no matter however trivial is ever omitted in the recounting
his associations work in such a tireless round of minute succession without ever being able to take a jump or a short cut that he is powerless to separate the wheat from the chaff so he dumps the whole indiscriminate mass into our ears
carpenter tells of a member of parliament who could repeat long legal documents and acts of parliament after one reading
when he was congratulated on his remarkable gift he replied that instead of being an advantage to him it was often a source of great inconvenience because when he wished to recollect anything in a document he had read he could do it only by repeating the whole from the beginning up to the point which he wished to recall
maudsley says that the kind of memory which enables a person to read a photographic copy of former impressions with his mind eye is not indeed commonly associated with high intellectual power and gives as a reason that such a mind is hindered by the very wealth of material furnished by the memory from discerning the relations between separate facts upon which judgment and reasoning depend
it is likewise a common source of surprise among teachers that many of the pupils who could outstrip their classmates in learning and memory do not turn out to be able men
but this says whately is as reasonable as to wonder that a cistern if filled should not be a perpetual fountain
it is possible for one to be so lost in a tangle of trees that he can not see the woods
a good memory requires good it is not then mere of facts that constitutes a good memory
the pupil who can reproduce a history lesson by the page has not necessarily as good a memory as the one who remembers fewer facts but sees the relations between those remembered and hence is to choose what he will
it must fasten on that which is important and keep that for us
therefore we can agree that art of remembering is the art of
discrimination must select the important out of our mental stream and these images must be associated with as many others as possible which are already well fixed in memory and hence are sure of recall when needed
in this way the old will always serve as a cue to call up the new
memory must be and not only must memory if it is to be a good memory omit the generally worthless or trivial or irrelevant and supply the generally useful significant and relevant but it must in some degree be a
it must minister to the particular needs and requirements of its owner
small consolation to you if you are a latin teacher and are able to call up the binomial theorem or the date of the fall of constantinople when you are in dire need of a conjugation or a declension which eludes you
it is much better for the merchant and politician to have a good memory for names and faces than to be able to repeat the succession of english monarchs from alfred the great to edward vii and not be able to tell john smith from tom brown
it is much more desirable for the lawyer to be able to remember the necessary details of his case than to be able to recall all the various athletic records of the year and so on
in order to be a good memory for our memory must be faithful in dealing with the material which constitutes the needs of our vocations
our memory may and should bring to us many things outside of our immediate vocations else our lives will be narrow but its chief concern and most accurate work must be along the path of our everyday requirements at its hands
and this works out well in connection with the physiological laws which were stated a little while since providing that our vocations are along the line of our interests
for the things with which we work daily and in which we are interested will be often thought of together and hence will become well associated
they will be frequently recalled and hence more easily remembered they will be vividly experienced as the inevitable result of interest and this goes far to insure recall
memory devices many devices have been invented for training or using the memory and not a few worthless systems have been imposed by conscienceless fakers upon uninformed people
all memorizing finally must go back to the fundamental laws of brain activity and the rules growing out of these laws
there is no royal road to a good memory
the effects of not a few students depend on cramming for much of their learning
if this method of study would yield as valuable permanent results it would be by far the most sensible and economical method to use for under the stress of necessity we often are able to accomplish results much faster than when no pressure is resting upon us
the difficulty is however that the results are not permanent the facts learned do not have time to seek out and link themselves to associates learned in an hour their retention is as ephemeral as the application which gave them to us facts which are needed but temporarily and which can not become a part of our body of permanent knowledge may profitably be learned by cramming
the lawyer needs many details for the case he is trying which not only are valueless to him as soon as the case is decided but would positively be in his way
he may profitably cram such facts
but those facts which are to become a permanent part of his mental equipment such as the fundamental principles of law he can not cram
these he must have in a logical chain which will not leave their recall dependent upon a chance cue
crammed facts may serve us during a recitation or an examination but they never really become a part of us
nothing can take the place of the logical placing of facts if they are to be remembered with facility and be usable in thinking when recalled
but after all this is taken into consideration there still remain a large number of facts which refuse to fit into any connected or logical system
or if they do belong with some system their connection is not very close and we have more need for the few individual facts than for the system as a whole
hence we must have some means of remembering such facts other than by connecting them with their logical associations
such facts as may be typified by the multiplication table certain dates events names numbers errands and engagements of various kinds all these need to be remembered accurately and quickly when the occasion for them arises
we must be able to recall them with facility so that the occasion will not have passed by before we can secure them and we have failed to do our part because of the lapse
with facts of this type the means of securing a good memory are the same as in the case of logical memory except that we must of necessity forego the linking to naturally related associates
we can however take advantage of the three laws which have been given
if these methods are used faithfully then we have done what we can in the way of insuring the recall of facts of this type unless we associate them with some artificial cue such as tying a thread around our finger to remember an errand or learning the multiplication table by singing it
we are not to be too ready to excuse ourselves however if we have forgotten to mail the letter or deliver the message for our attention may have been very lax when we recorded the direction in the first place and we may never have taken the trouble to think of the matter between the time it was given into our keeping and the time we were to perform the errand
mnemonic many ingenious devices have been invented to assist the memory
no doubt each one of you has some way of your own of remembering certain things committed to you or some fact which has a tendency to elude you
you may not tie the traditional string around your finger or place your watch in the wrong pocket but if not you have invented some method which suits your convenience better
while many books have been written and many lectures given exploiting mnemonic systems they are however all founded upon the same general principle namely that of of in the mind
they all make use of the same basis for memory that any of us use every time we remember anything from the commonest event which occurred last hour to the most abstruse bit of philosophy which we may have in our minds
they all tie the fact to be remembered to some other fact which is sure of recall and then trust the old fact to bring the new along with it when it again comes into the mind
artificial devices may be permissible in remembering the class of facts which have no logical associates in which we can relate them but even then i can not help feeling that if we should use the same care and ingenuity in carefully recording the seemingly unrelated facts that we do in working out the device and making the association in it we should discover hidden relations for most of the facts we wish to remember and we should be able to insure their recall as certainly and in a better way than through the device
then also we should not be in danger of handing over to the device various facts for which we should discover relations thus placing them in the logical body of our usable knowledge where they belong
carefully consider your own powers of memory and see whether you can decide which of the four types of brain you have
apply similar tests to your classmates or a group of school children whom you have a chance to observe
be sure to take into account the effects of past training or habits of memory
watch in your own memorizing and also that of school children for failures in recall caused by lack of proper associations
why is it particularly hard to commit what one does not understand
observe a class in a recitation or an examination and seek to discover whether any defects of memory revealed are to be explained by lack of  repetition  recency  vividness in learning
make a study of your own class and also of a group of children in school to discover their methods of memorizing
have in mind the rules for memorizing given in section  of this chapter
observe by introspection your method of recall of historical events you have studied and note whether form an important part of your memory material or does your recall consist chiefly of bare
in how far does this depend on your method of
carefully consider your experience from cramming your lessons
does the material learned in this way stay with you
it as well as stuff learned during a longer interval and with more time for associations to form
no word is more constantly on our lips than the word
a hundred times a day we tell what we think about this thing or that
any exceptional power of thought classes us among the efficient of our generation
it is in their ability to think that men stand pre√´minently above the animals
the term or is employed in so many different senses that it will be well first of all to come to an understanding as to its various uses
four different types of thinking which we shall note are   or idle thinking  thinking in the form of  thinking and  thinking
chance or idle our thinking is of the chance or idle kind when we think to no conscious end
no particular problem is up for solution and the stream of thought drifts along in idleness
in such thinking immediate interest some idle fancy the impulse of the moment or the suggestions from our environment determine the train of associations and give direction to our thought
in a sense we surrender our mental bark to the winds of circumstance to drive it whithersoever they will without let or hindrance from us
since no results are sought from our thinking none are obtained
the best of us spend more time in these idle trains of thought than we would like to admit while inferior and untrained minds seldom rise above this barren thought level
not infrequently even when we are studying a lesson which demands our best thought power we find that an idle chain of associations has supplanted the more rigid type of thinking and appropriated the field
uncritical we often say that we think a certain thing is true or false when we have as a matter of fact done little or no thinking about it
we only or uncritically accept the common point of view as to the truth or untruth of the matter concerned
the ancients believed that the earth was flat and the savages that eclipses were caused by animals eating up the moon
not a few people today believe that potatoes and other vegetables should be planted at a certain phase of the moon that sickness is a visitation of providence and that various charms are potent to bring good fortune or ward off disaster
probably not one in a thousand of those who accept such beliefs could give or have ever tried to give any rational reason for their point of view
but we must not be too harsh toward such crude illustrations of uncritical thinking
it is entirely possible that not all of us who pride ourselves on our trained powers of thought could give good reasons discovered by our own thinking why we think our political party our church or our social organization is better than some other one
how few of us after all really our creed a church or a political party
we adopt the points of view of our nation or our group much as we adopt their customs and dress not because we are convinced by thinking that they are best but because they are less trouble
assimilative it is this type of thinking that occupies us when we seek to appropriate new facts or ideas and understand them that is relate them to knowledge already on hand
we think after this fashion in much of our study in schools and textbooks
the problem for our thought is not so much one of invention or discovery as of grasp and assimilation
our thinking is to apprehend meanings and relations and so unify and give coherence to our knowledge
in the absence of this type of thinking one may commit to memory many facts that he does not understand gather much information that contains little meaning to him and even achieve very creditable scholastic grades that stand for a small amount of education or development
for all information to become vital and usable must be thought into relation to our present active functioning body of knowledge therefore assimilative thinking is fundamental to true mastery and learning
deliberative deliberative thinking constitutes the highest type of thought process
in order to do deliberative thinking there is necessary first of all what dewey calls a situation
a traveler going along a highway says dewey does not deliberate he simply keeps on going
but let the highway split into two roads at a fork only one of which leads to the desired destination and now a problem confronts him he must take one road or the other but
the intelligent traveler will at once go to for as to which road he should choose
he will balance this fact against that fact and this probability against that probability in an effort to arrive at a solution of his problem
before we can engage in deliberative thinking we must be confronted by some problem some such situation in our mental stream we must have something to think about
it is this fact that makes one writer say that the great purpose of one education is not to solve all his problems for him
it is rather to help him  to problems or situations  to assist him in gathering the facts necessary for their solution and  to train him in the weighing of his facts or evidence that is in deliberative thinking
only as we learn to recognize the true problems that confront us in our own lives and in society about us can we become thinkers in the best sense
our own plans and projects the questions of right and wrong that are constantly arising the social political and religious problems awaiting solution all afford the opportunity and the necessity for deliberative thinking
and unhappy is the pupil whose school work does not set the problems and employ the methods which will insure training in this as well as in the assimilative type of thinking
every school subject besides supplying certain information to be learned should present its problems requiring true deliberative thinking within the range of development and ability of the pupil and no subject literature history science language is without many such problems
the function of thinking all true thinking is for the purpose of discovering relations between the things we think about
imagine a world in which nothing is related to anything else in which every object perceived remembered or imagined stands absolutely by itself independent and
we might perceive remember and imagine all the various objects we please but without the power to think them together they would all be totally unrelated and hence have no meaning
meaning depends on to have a rational meaning for us things must always be defined in terms of other things or in terms of their uses
are to to to to to and so on through the whole list of objects which we know or can define
everything depends for its meaning on its relation to other things and the more of these relations we can discover the more fully do we see the meaning
thus balls may have other uses than to throw schools other functions than to instruct and friends mean much more to us than mere enjoyment
and just in the degree in which we have realized these different relations have we defined the object or in other words have we seen its meaning
the function of thinking is to discover now it is by that these relations are discovered
this is the function of thinking
thinking takes the various separate items of our experience and discovers to us the relations existing among them and builds them together into a unified related and usable body of knowledge threading each little bit on the string of relationship which runs through the whole
it was no doubt this thought which tennyson had in mind when he wrote flower in the crannied wall i pluck you out of the crannies i hold you here root and all in my hand little flower but if i could understand what you are root and all and all in all i should know what god and man is
starting in with even so simple a thing as a little flower if he could discover all the relations which every part bears to every other part and to all other things besides he would finally reach the meaning of god and man
for each separate thing be it large or small forms a link in an unbroken chain of relationships which binds the universe into an ordered whole
near and remote the relations discovered through our thinking may be very close and simple ones as when a child sees the relation between his bottle and his dinner or they may be very remote ones as when newton saw the relation between the falling of an apple and the motion of the planets in their orbits
but whether simple or remote the seeing of the relationships is in both cases alike thinking for thinking is nothing in its last analysis but the discovering of the relationships which exist between the various objects in our mental stream
thinking passes through all grades of complexity from the first faint dawnings in the mind of the babe when it sees the relation between the mother and its feeding on to the mighty grasp of the sage who is able to think god thoughts after him
but it all comes to the same end finally the bringing to light of new meanings through the discovery of new relations
and whatever does this is thinking
what constitutes the difference in the thinking of the child and that of the sage
let us see whether we can discover this difference
in the first place the relations seen by the child are relations they exist between simple percepts or images the remote and the general are beyond his reach
he has not had sufficient experience to enable him to discover remote relations
he can not think things which are absent from him or which he has never known
the child could by no possibility have seen in the falling apple what newton saw for the child knew nothing of the planets in their orbits and hence could not see relations in which these formed one of the terms
the sage on the other hand is not limited to his immediate percepts or their images
he can go beyond individuals and think in classes
the falling apple is not a mere falling apple to him but one of a of falling
besides a rich experience full of valuable facts the trained thinker has acquired also the habit of looking out for relations he has learned that this is the method of increasing his store of knowledge and of rendering effective the knowledge he has
the chief business of the child is the collection of the materials of thought seeing only the more necessary and obvious relations as he proceeds his chief business when older grown is to seek out the network of relations which unites this mass of material and through this process to systematize and give new meanings to the whole
it is evident from the foregoing discussion that we may include under the term thinking all sorts of mental processes by which relations are apprehended between different objects of thought
thus young children think as soon as they begin to understand something of the meaning of the objects of their environment
even animals think by means of simple and direct associations
thinking may therefore go on in terms of the simplest and most immediate or the most complex and distant relationships sensations and percepts as elements in relations seen between sensations would mean something but not much relations seen between immediately present to the senses would mean much more but our thinking must go far beyond the present and likewise far beyond individual objects
it must be able to annihilate both time and space and to deal with millions of individuals together in one group or class
only in this way can our thinking go beyond that of the lower animals for a wise rat even may come to see the relation between a trap and danger or a horse the relation between pulling with his teeth at the piece of string on the gate latch and securing his liberty
but it takes the mind of man to
perception alone does not go far enough
it is limited to immediately present objects and their most obvious relations
the perceptual image is likewise subject to similar limitations
while it enables us to dispense with the immediate presence of the object yet it deals with separate individuals and the world is too full of individual objects for us to deal with them separately
it is in and that true thinking takes place
our next purpose will therefore be to study these somewhat more closely and see how they combine in our thinking
the concept fortunately for our thinking the great external world with its millions upon millions of individual objects is so ordered that these objects can be grouped into comparatively few great classes and for many purposes we can deal with the class as a whole instead of with the separate individuals of the class
thus there are an infinite number of individual objects in the world which are composed of
yet all these myriads of individuals may be classed under the two great heads of and
taking one of these again all animate forms may be classed as either or
and these classes may again be subdivided indefinitely
animals include mammals birds reptiles insects mollusks and many other classes besides each class of which may be still further separated into its and
this arrangement economizes our thinking by allowing us to think in large terms
the concepts serve to group and but the somewhat complicated form of classification just described did not come to man
the relationship existing among the myriads of animals of a certain class and group these together under the general term
likewise with birds reptiles insects and all the rest
in order to accomplish this many individuals of each class had to be observed the qualities common to all members of the class discriminated from those not common and the common qualities retained as the measure by which to test the admission of other individuals into this class
the process of classification is made possible by what the psychologist calls the
the concept enables us to think as well as bluebirds robins and wrens it enables us to think as well as tom dick and harry
in other words concept lies at the bottom of all thinking which rises above the seeing of the simplest relations between immediately present
growth of a we can perhaps best understand the nature of the concept if we watch its growth in the thinking of a child
let us see how the child forms the concept under which he is able finally to class the several hundred or the several thousand different dogs with which his thinking requires him to deal
the child first acquaintance with a dog is let us suppose with a pet poodle white in color and named
at this stage in the child experience and
are entirely synonymous including gyp color size and all other qualities which the child has discovered
but now let him see another pet poodle which is like gyp except that it is black in color
here comes the first cleavage between and as synonyms no longer means white but may mean
next let the child see a brown spaniel
not only will white and black now no longer answer to but the poodle form also has been lost for the spaniel is more slender
let the child go on from this until he has seen many different dogs of all varieties poodles bulldogs setters shepherds cockers and a host of others
what has happened to his which at the beginning meant the one particular little individual with which he played
is no longer white or black or brown or gray is not an essential quality so it has dropped out is no longer essential except within very broad limits or of coat is a very inconstant quality so this is dropped varies so much from the fat pug to the slender hound that it is discarded except within broad limits and a dozen other qualities are likewise found not to belong in common to dogs and so have had to go and all that is left to his is and a certain general
and a few other dog qualities of habit of life and disposition
as the term has been gaining in that is as more individuals have been observed and classed under it it has correspondingly been losing in or it has been losing in the specific qualities which belong to it
yet it must not be thought that the process is altogether one of elimination for new qualities which are present in all the individuals of a class but at first overlooked are continually being discovered as experience grows and built into the developing concept
definition of a concept then is general idea or notion of a class of individual
its function is to enable us to classify our knowledge and thus deal with classes or universals in our thinking
often the basis of a concept consists of an as when you get a hazy visual image of a mass of people when i suggest to you
yet the core or the vital functioning part of a concept is its
whether this meaning attaches to an image or a word or stands relatively or completely independent of either does not so much matter but our meanings must be right else all our thinking is wrong
language and the we think in words
none has failed to watch the flow of his thought as it is carried along by words like so many little boats moving along the mental stream each with its freight of meaning
and no one has escaped the temporary balking of his thought by failure to find a suitable word to convey the intended meaning
what the grammarian calls the of our language are the words by which we name our concepts and are able to speak of them to others
we define a common noun as the name of a class and we define a concept as the meaning or idea we have of a class
it is easy to see that when we have named these class
we have our list of common nouns
the study of the language of a people may therefore reveal much of their type of thought
the necessity for growing the development of our concepts constitutes a large part of our education
for it is evident that since thinking rests so fundamentally on concepts progress in our mental life must depend on a constant growth in the number and character of our concepts
not only must we keep on adding new concepts but the old must not remain static
when our concepts stop growing our minds have ceased to grow we no longer learn
this arrest of development is often seen in persons who have settled into a life of narrow routine where the demands are few and of a simple nature
unless they rise above their routine they early become old fogies
their concepts petrify from lack of use and the constant reconstruction which growth necessitates
on the other hand the person who has upon him the constant demand to meet new situations or do better in old ones will keep on enriching his old concepts and forming new ones or else unable to do this he will fail in his position
and the person who keeps on steadily enriching his concepts has discovered the secret of perpetual youth so far as his mental life is concerned
for him there is no old age his thought will be always fresh his experience always accumulating and his knowledge growing more valuable and usable
but in the building up of percepts and concepts as well as in making use of them after they are formed another process of thinking enters namely the process of
nature of judging enters more or less into all our thinking from the simplest to the most complex
the babe lies staring at his bottle and finally it dawns on his sluggish mind that this is the object from which he gets his dinner
that is he has alternately directed his attention to the object before him and to his image of former nursing discovered the relation existing between the two and affirmed to himself this is what gives me my dinner
bottle and are essentially identical to the child
judgment is then the affirmation of the essential identity of meaning of two objects of thought
even if the proposition in which we state our judgment has in it a negative the definition will still hold for the mental process is the same in either case
it is as much a judgment if we say the day is as if we say the day is cold
judgment used in percepts and how judgment enters into the forming of our percepts may be seen from the illustration just given
the act by which the child perceived his bottle had in it a large element of judging
he had to compare two objects of thought the one from past experience in the form of images and the other from the present object in the form of sensations from the bottle and then affirm their essential identity
of course it is not meant that what i have described takes place in the mind of the child but some such process lies at the bottom of every perception whether of the child or anyone else
likewise it may be seen that the forming of concepts depends on judgment
every time that we meet a new object which has to be assigned its place in our classification judgment is required
suppose the child with his immature concept sees for the first time a greyhound
he must compare this new specimen with his concept and decide that this is or is not a dog
if he discovers the identity of meaning in the essentials of the two objects of thought his judgment will be affirmative and his concept will be modified in whatever extent will affect it
but judgment goes much farther than to assist in building percepts and concepts
it takes our concepts after they are formed and discovers and affirms relations between them thus enabling us finally to relate classes as well as individuals
it carries our thinking over into the realm of the universal where we are not hampered by particulars
suppose we have the concept and the concept and that we think of these two concepts in their relation to each other
the mind analyzes each into its elements compares them and finds the essential identity of meaning in a sufficient number to warrant the judgment is an
this judgment has given a new bit of knowledge in that it has discovered to us a new relation between two great classes and hence given both in so far a new meaning and a wider definition
and as this new relation does not pertain to any particular man or any particular animal but includes all individuals in each class it has carried us over into universals so that we have a truth and will not have to test each individual man henceforth to see whether he fits into this relation
judgments also as we will see later constitute the material for our reasoning
hence upon their validity will depend the validity of our reasoning
the validity of now since every judgment is made up of an affirmation of relation existing between two terms it is evident that the validity of the judgment will depend on the thoroughness of our knowledge of the terms compared
if we know but few of the attributes of either term of the judgment the judgment is clearly unsafe
imperfect concepts lie at the basis of many of our wrong judgments
a young man complained because his friend had been expelled from college for alleged misbehavior
he said a was the best boy in the institution
it is very evident that someone had made a mistake in judgment
surely no college would want to expel the best boy in the institution
either my complainant or the authorities of the college had failed to understand one of the terms in the judgment
either a or the best boy in the institution had been wrongly interpreted by someone
likewise one person will say jones is a good man while another will say jones is a rascal
such a discrepancy in judgment must come from a lack of acquaintance with jones or a lack of knowledge of what constitutes a good man or a rascal
no doubt most of us are prone to make judgments with too little knowledge of the terms we are comparing and it is usually those who have the least reason for confidence in their judgments who are the most certain that they can not be mistaken
the remedy for faulty judgments is of course in making ourselves more certain of the terms involved and this in turn sends us back for a review of our concepts or the experience upon which the terms depend
it is evident that no two persons can have just the same concepts for all have not had the same experience out of which their concepts came
the concepts may be named the same and may be nearly enough alike so that we can usually understand each other but after all i have mine and you have yours and if we could each see the other in their true light no doubt we should save many misunderstandings and quarrels
reasoning all the mental processes which we have so far described find their culmination and highest utility in
not that reasoning comes last in the list of mental activities and can not take place until all the others have been completed for reasoning is in some degree present almost from the dawn of consciousness
the difference between the reasoning of the child and that of the adult is largely one of degree of reach
reasoning goes farther than any of the other processes of cognition for it takes the relations expressed in judgments and out of these relations evolves still other and more ultimate relations
nature of it is hard to define reasoning so as to describe the precise process which occurs for it is so intermingled with perception conception and judgment that one can hardly separate them even for purposes of analysis much less to separate them functionally
we may however define reasoning provisionally as by means of a series of judgments with the purpose of arriving at some definite end or
professor angell has stated the matter so clearly that i will quote his illustration of the case suppose that we are about to make a long journey which necessitates the choice from among a number of possible routes
this is a case of the genuinely problematic kind
it requires reflection a weighing of the and and giving of the final decision in favor of one or other of several alternatives
in such a case the procedure of most of us is after this order
we think of one route as being picturesque and wholly novel but also as being expensive
we think of another as less interesting but also as less expensive
a third is we discover the most expedient but also the most costly of the three
we find ourselves confronted then with the necessity of choosing with regard to the relative merits of cheapness beauty and speed
we proceed to consider these points in the light of all our interests and the decision more or less makes itself
we find for instance that we must under the circumstances select the cheapest route
how judgments function in such a line of thinking is very common to everyone and one that we carry out in one form or another a thousand times every day we live
when we come to look closely at the steps involved in arriving at a conclusion we detect a series of judgments often not very logically arranged to be sure but yet so related that the result is safely reached in the end
we compare our concept of say the first route and our concept of picturesqueness decide they agree and affirm the judgment this route is picturesque
likewise we arrive at the judgment this route is also expensive it is interesting etc
then we take the other routes and form our judgments concerning them
these judgments are all related to each other in some way some of them being more intimately related than others
which judgments remain as the significant ones the ones which are used to solve the problem finally depends on which concepts are the most vital for us with reference to the ultimate end in view
if time is the chief element then the form of our reasoning would be something like this two of the routes require more than three days hence i must take the third route
if economy is the important end the solution would be as follows two routes cost more than i can not afford to pay more than  i therefore must patronize the third route
in both cases it is evident that the conclusion is reached through a comparison of two or more judgments
this is the essential difference between judgment and reasoning
whereas judgment discovers relations between concepts discovers relations between judgments and from this evolves a new judgment which is the conclusion
the example given well illustrates the ordinary method by which we reason to conclusions
deduction and the logic may take the conclusion with the two judgments on which it is based and form the three into what is called a of which the following is a classical type all men are mortal socrates is a man therefore socrates is mortal
the first judgment is in the form of a proposition which is called the because it is general in its nature including all men
the second is the since it deals with a particular man
the third is the in which a new relation is discovered between socrates and mortality
this form of reasoning is that is it proceeds from the general to the particular
much of our reasoning is an abbreviated form of the syllogism and will readily expand into it
for instance we say it will rain tonight for there is lightning in the west
expanded into the syllogism form it would be lightning in the west is a sure sign of rain there is lightning in the west this evening therefore it will rain tonight
while we do not commonly think in complete syllogisms it is often convenient to cast our reasoning in this form to test its validity
for example a fallacy lurks in the generalization lightning in the west is a sure sign of rain
hence the conclusion is of doubtful validity
deduction is a valuable form of reasoning but a moment reflection will show that something must precede the syllogism in our reasoning
how are we able to say that all men are mortal and that lightning in the west is a sure sign of rain
how was this general truth arrived at
there is only one way namely through the observation of a large number of particular instances or through
induction is the method of proceeding from the particular to the general
many men are observed and it is found that all who have been observed have died under a certain age
it is true that not all men have been observed to die since many are now living and many more will no doubt come and live in the world whom can not observe since mortality will have overtaken us before their advent
to this it may be answered that the men now living have not yet lived up to the limit of their time and besides they have within them the causes working whose inevitable effect has always been and always will be death likewise with the men yet unborn they will possess the same organism as we whose very nature necessitates mortality
in the case of the premonitions of rain the generalization is not so safe for there have been exceptions
lightning in the west at night is not always followed by rain nor can we find inherent causes as in the other case which necessitates rain as an effect
the necessity for broad thus it is seen that our generalizations or major premises are of all degrees of validity
in the case of some as the mortality of man millions of cases have been observed and no exceptions found but on the contrary causes discovered whose operation renders the result inevitable
in others as for instance in the generalization once made all animals chew their cud not only had the examination of individual cases not been carried so far as in the former case when the generalization was made but there were found no inherent causes residing in animals which make it necessary for them to chew their cud
that is cloven feet and do not of necessity go together and the case of the pig disproves the generalization
in practically no instance however is it possible for us to examine every case upon which a generalization is based after examining a sufficient number of cases and particularly if there are supporting causes we are warranted in making the inductive leap or in proceeding at once to state our generalization as a working hypothesis
of course it is easy to see that if we have a wrong generalization if our major premise is invalid all that follows in our chain of reasoning will be worthless
this fact should render us careful in making generalizations on too narrow a basis of induction
we may have observed that certain people of our acquaintance are but we are not justified from this in making the general statement that all people are
not only have we not examined a sufficient number of cases to warrant such a conclusion but we have found in the red hair not even a cause of quick temper but only an occasional concomitant
the interrelation of induction and induction and deduction must go hand in hand in building up our world of knowledge
induction gives us the particular facts out of which our system of knowledge is built furnishes us with the data out of which general truths are formed deduction allows us to start with the generalization furnished us by induction and from this vantage ground to organize and systematize our knowledge and through the discovery of its relations to unify it and make it usable
deduction starts with a general truth and asks the question what new relations are made necessary among particular facts by this truth
induction starts with particulars and asks the question to what general truth do these separate facts lead
each method of reasoning needs the other
deduction must have induction to furnish the facts for its premises induction must have deduction to organize these separate facts into a unified body of knowledge
he only sees well who sees the whole in the parts and the parts in the whole
watch your own thinking for examples of each of the four types described
observe a class of children in a recitation or at study and try to decide which type is being employed by each child
what proportion of the time supposedly given to study is given over to or idle thinking
observe children at work in school with the purpose of determining whether they are being taught to or only to memorize certain facts
do you find that definitions whose meaning is not clear are often required of children
which should come first the definition or the meaning and application of it
it is of course evident from the relation of induction and deduction that the child natural mode of learning a subject is by induction
observe the teaching of children to determine whether inductive methods are commonly used
outline an inductive lesson in arithmetic physiology geography civics etc
what concepts have you now which you are aware are very meager
have you any concepts which you are working very hard to enrich
recall some judgment which you have made and which proved to be false and see whether you can now discover what was wrong with it
do you find the trouble to be an inadequate concept
did you ever make a mistake in an example in say percentage by saying this is the base when it proved not to be
what was the cause of the error
can you recall any instance in which you made too hasty a generalization when you had observed but few cases upon which to base your premise
what of your reasoning which followed
see whether you can show that validity of reasoning rests ultimately on correct perceptions
what are you doing at present to increase your power of thinking
how ought this chapter to help one in making a better teacher
chapter xiii instinct nothing is more wonderful than nature method of endowing each individual at the beginning with all the impulses tendencies and capacities that are to control and determine the outcome of the life
the acorn has the perfect oak tree in its heart the complete butterfly exists in the grub and man at his highest powers is present in the babe at birth
education nothing to what heredity supplies but only develops what is present from the first
we are a part of a great unbroken procession of life which began at the beginning and will go on till the end
each generation receives through heredity the products of the long experience through which the race has passed
the generation receiving the gift today lives its own brief life makes its own little contribution to the sum total and then passes on as millions have done before
through heredity the achievements the passions the fears and the tragedies of generations long since moldered to dust stir our blood and tone our nerves for the conflict of today
every child born into the world has resting upon him an unseen hand reaching out from the past pushing him out to meet his environment and guiding him in the start upon his journey
this impelling and guiding power from the past we call
in the words of mosso instinct is the voice of past generations reverberating like a distant echo in the cells of the nervous system
we feel the breath the advice the experience of all men from those who lived on acorns and struggled like wild beasts dying naked in the forests down to the virtue and toil of our father the fear and love of our mother
the babe dependence on the child is born ignorant and helpless
it has no memory no reason no imagination
it has never performed a conscious act and does not know how to begin
it has no experience to direct it and is unable to understand or imitate others of its kind
it is at this point that instinct comes to the rescue
the race has not given the child a mind ready made that must develop but it has given him a nervous system ready to respond with the proper movements when it receives the touch of its environment through the senses
and this nervous system has been so trained during a limitless past that its responses are the ones which are necessary for the welfare of its owner
it can do a hundred things without having to wait to learn them
burdette says of the child nobody told him what to do
placed suddenly on the guest list of this old caravansary he knew his way at once to two places in it his bedroom and the
a thousand generations of babies had done the same thing in the same way and each had made it a little easier for this particular baby to do his part without learning how
definition of are the tendency to act in certain definite ways without previous education and without a conscious end in
they are a tendency to for some movement or motor adjustment is the response to an instinct
they do not require previous for none is possible with many instinctive acts the duck does not have to be taught to swim or the baby to suck
they have no conscious in view though the result may be highly desirable
says james the cat runs after the mouse runs or shows fight before the dog avoids falling from walls and trees shuns fire and water not because he has any notion either of life or death or of self or of preservation
he has probably attained to no one of these conceptions in such a way as to react definitely upon it
he acts in each case separately and simply because he can not help it being so framed that when that particular running thing called a mouse appears in his field of vision he pursue that when that particular barking and obstreperous thing called a dog appears he retire if at a distance and scratch if close by that he withdraw his feet from water and his face from flame etc
his nervous system is to a great extent a bundle of such reactions
they are as fatal as sneezing and exactly correlated to their special excitants as it to its own
you ask why does the lark rise on the flash of a sunbeam from his meadow to the morning sky leaving a trail of melody to mark his flight
why does the beaver build his dam and the oriole hang her nest
why are myriads of animal forms on the earth today doing what they were countless generations ago
why does the lover seek the maid and the mother cherish her young
because the voice of the past speaks to the present and the present has no choice but to obey
instincts are racial instincts are the habits of the race which it bequeaths to the individual the individual takes these for his start and then modifies them through education and thus adapts himself to his environment
through his instincts the individual is enabled to racial experience and begin at once on life activities which the race has been ages in acquiring
instinct preserves to us what the race has achieved in experience and so starts us out where the race left off
unmodified instinct is many of the lower animal forms act on instinct blindly unable to use past experience to guide their acts incapable of education
some of them carry out seemingly marvelous activities yet their acts are as automatic as those of a machine and as devoid of foresight
a species of mud wasp carefully selects clay of just the right consistency finds a somewhat sheltered nook under the eaves and builds its nest leaving one open door
then it seeks a certain kind of spider and having stung it so as to benumb without killing carries it into the nest lays its eggs on the body of the spider so that the young wasps may have food immediately upon hatching out then goes out and plasters the door over carefully to exclude all intruders
its acts were dictated not by plans for the future but by pressure from the past
let the supply of clay fail or the race of spiders become extinct and the wasp is helpless and its species will perish
likewise the of bees and ants have done wonderful things but bees and ants are very stupid and helpless when confronted by any novel conditions to which their race has not been accustomed
man starts in as blindly as the lower animals but thanks to his higher mental powers this blindness soon gives way to foresight and he is able to formulate purposeful ends and adapt his activities to their accomplishment
possessing a larger number of instincts than the lower animals have man finds possible a greater number of responses to a more complex environment than do they
this advantage coupled with his ability to reconstruct his experience in such a way that he secures constantly increasing control over his environment easily makes man the superior of all the animals and enables him to exploit them for his own further advancement
law of the appearance and disappearance of instincts
no child is born with all its instincts ripe and ready for action
yet each individual contains within his own inner nature the law which determines the order and time of their development
instincts appear in succession as it is not well that we should be started on too many different lines of activity at once hence our instincts do not all appear at the same time
only as fast as we need additional activities do they ripen
our very earliest activities are concerned chiefly with feeding hence we first have the instincts which prompt us to take our food and to cry for it when we are hungry
also we find useful such abbreviated instincts called as sneezing snuffling gagging vomiting starting etc hence we have the instincts enabling us to do these things
soon comes the time for teething and to help the matter along the instinct of biting enters and the rubber ring is in demand
the time approaches when we are to feed ourselves so the instinct arises to carry everything to the mouth
now we have grown strong and must assume an erect attitude hence the instinct to sit up and then to stand
locomotion comes next and with it the instinct to creep and walk
also a language must be learned and we must take part in the busy life about us and do as other people do so the instinct to imitate arises that we may learn things quickly and easily
we need a spur to keep us up to our best effort so the instinct of emulation emerges
we must defend ourselves so the instinct of pugnacity is born
we need to be cautious hence the instinct of fear
we need to be investigative hence the instinct of curiosity
much activity is necessary for our development hence the play instinct
it is best that we should come to know and serve others so the instincts of sociability and sympathy arise
we need to select a mate and care for offspring hence the instinct of love for the other sex and the parental instinct
this is far from a complete list of our instincts and i have not tried to follow the order of their development but i have given enough to show the origin of many of our life most important activities
many instincts are not only do instincts ripen by degrees entering our experience one by one as they are needed but they drop out when their work is done
some like the instinct of are needed our lifetime through hence they remain to the end
others like the play instinct serve their purpose and disappear or are modified into new forms in a few years or a few months
the life of the instinct is always as transitory as is the necessity for the activity to which it gives rise
no instinct remains wholly unaltered in man for it is constantly being made over in the light of each new experience
the instinct of is modified by knowledge and experience so that the defense of the man against threatened danger would be very different from that of the child yet the instinct to protect oneself in way remains
on the other hand the instinct to romp and play is less permanent
it may last into adult life but few or old people care to race about as do children
their activities are occupied in other lines and they require less physical exertion
contrast with these two examples such instincts as sucking creeping and crying which are much more fleeting than the play instinct even
with dentition comes another mode of eating and sucking is no more serviceable
walking is a better mode of locomotion than creeping so the instinct to creep soon dies
speech is found a better way than crying to attract attention to distress so this instinct drops out
many of our instincts not only would fail to be serviceable in our later lives but would be positively in the way
each serves its day and then passes over into so modified a form as not to be recognized or else drops out of sight altogether
seemingly useless indeed it is difficult to see that some instincts serve a useful purpose at any time
the pugnacity and greediness of childhood its foolish fears the bashfulness of youth these seem to be either useless or detrimental to development
in order to understand the workings of instinct however we must remember that it looks in two directions into the future for its application and into the past for its explanation
we should not be surprised if the experiences of a long past have left behind some tendencies which are not very useful under the vastly different conditions of today
nor should we be too sure that an activity whose precise function in relation to development we can not discover has no use at all
each instinct must be considered not alone in the light of what it means to its possessor today but of what it means to all his future development
the tail of a polliwog seems a very useless appendage so far as the adult frog is concerned yet if the polliwog tail is cut off a perfect frog never develops
instincts to be utilized when they a man may set the stream to turning his mill wheels today or wait for twenty years the power is there ready for him when he wants it
instincts must be utilized when they present themselves else they disappear never in most cases to return
birds kept caged past the flying time never learn to fly well
the hunter must train his setter when the time is ripe or the dog can never be depended upon
ducks kept away from the water until full grown have almost as little inclination for it as chickens
the child whom the pressure of circumstances or unwise authority of parents keeps from mingling with playmates and participating in their plays and games when the social instinct is strong upon him will in later life find himself a hopeless recluse to whom social duties are a bore
the boy who does not hunt and fish and race and climb at the proper time for these things will find his taste for them fade away and he will become wedded to a sedentary life
the youth and maiden must be permitted to dress up when the impulse comes to them or they are likely ever after to be careless in their attire
instincts as starting most of our habits have their rise in instincts and all desirable instincts should be seized upon and transformed into habits before they fade away
says james in his remarkable chapter on instinct in all pedagogy the great thing is to strike while the iron is hot and to seize the wave of the pupils ' interest in each successive subject before its ebb has come so that knowledge may be got and a habit of skill acquired a headway of interest in short secured on which afterwards the individual may float
there is a happy moment for fixing skill in drawing for making boys collectors in natural history and presently dissectors and botanists then for initiating them into the harmonies of mechanics and the wonders of physical and chemical law
later introspective psychology and the metaphysical and religious mysteries take their turn and last of all the drama of human affairs and worldly wisdom in the widest sense of the term
in each of us a saturation point is soon reached in all these things the impetus of our purely intellectual zeal expires and unless the topic is associated with some urgent personal need that keeps our wits constantly whetted about it we settle into an equilibrium and live on what we learned when our interest was fresh and instinctive without adding to the store
there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries
the more important human it will be impossible in this brief statement to give a complete catalogue of the human instincts much less to discuss each in detail
we must content ourselves therefore with naming the more important instincts and finally discussing a few of them
objects with the to the and may be said to head the list of our instincts
it will be impossible in our brief space to discuss all of this list
only a few of the more important will be noticed
no individual enters the world with a large enough stock of instincts to start him doing all the things necessary for his welfare
instinct prompts him to eat when he is hungry but does not tell him to use a knife and fork and spoon it prompts him to use vocal speech but does not say whether he shall use english french or german it prompts him to be social in his nature but does not specify that he shall say please and thank you and take off his hat to ladies
the race did not find the specific in which these and many other things are to be done of sufficient importance to crystallize them in instincts hence the individual must learn them as he needs them
the simplest way of accomplishing this is for each generation to copy the ways of doing things which are followed by the older generation among whom they are born
nature of is the instinct to respond to a suggestion from another by repeating his
the instinct of imitation is active in the child it requires another year or two to reach its height then it gradually grows less marked but continues in some degree throughout life
the young child is practically helpless in the matter of imitation
instinct demands that he shall imitate and he has no choice but to obey
his environment furnishes the models which he must imitate whether they are good or bad
before he is old enough for intelligent choice he has imitated a multitude of acts about him and habit has seized upon these acts and is weaving them into conduct and character
older grown we may choose what we will imitate but in our earlier years we are at the mercy of the models which are placed before us
if our mother tongue is the first we hear spoken that will be our language but if we first hear chinese we will learn that with almost equal facility
if whatever speech we hear is well spoken correct and beautiful so will our language be if it is vulgar or incorrect or slangy our speech will be of this kind
if the first manners which serve us as models are coarse and boorish ours will resemble them if they are cultivated and refined ours will be like them
if our models of conduct and morals are questionable our conduct and morals will be of like type
our manner of walking of dressing of thinking of saying our prayers even originates in imitation
by imitation we adopt our social standards our political faith and our religious creeds
our views of life and the values we set on its attainments are largely a matter of imitation
individuality in yet given the same model no two of us will imitate precisely alike
your acts will be yours and mine will be mine
this is because no two of us have just the same heredity and hence can not have precisely similar instincts
there reside in our different personalities different powers of invention and originality and these determine by how much the product of imitation will vary from the model
some remain imitators all their lives while others use imitation as a means to the invention of better types than the original models
the person who is an imitator only lacks individuality and initiative the nation which is an imitator only is stagnant and unprogressive
while imitation must be blind in both cases at first it should be increasingly intelligent as the individual or the nation progresses
conscious and unconscious the dictum that all consciousness is motor has a direct application to imitation
we have a tendency to act on whatever idea occupies the
think of yawning or clearing the throat and the tendency is strong to do these things
we naturally respond to smile with smile and to frown with frown
and even the impressions coming to us from our material environment have their influence on our acts
our response to these ideas may be a conscious one as when a boy purposely stutters in order to mimic an unfortunate companion or it may be unconscious as when the boy unknowingly falls into the habit of stammering from hearing this kind of speech
the child may consciously seek to keep himself neat and clean so as to harmonize with a pleasant and home or he may unconsciously become slovenly and from living in an home where constant bickering is the rule
often we deliberately imitate what seems to us desirable in other people but probably far the greater proportion of the suggestions to which we respond are received and acted upon unconsciously
in conscious imitation we can select what models we shall imitate and therefore protect ourselves in so far as our judgment of good and bad models is valid
in unconscious imitation however we are constantly responding to a stream of suggestions pouring in upon us hour after hour and day after day with no protection but the leadings of our interests as they direct our attention now to this phase of our environment and now to that
influence of no small part of the influences which mold our lives comes from our material environment
good clothes artistic homes beautiful pictures and decoration attractive parks and lawns streets books all these have a direct moral and educative value on the other hand squalor disorder and ugliness are an incentive to ignorance and crime
hawthorne tells in the great stone face of the boy ernest listening to the tradition of a coming wise man who one day is to rule over the valley
the story sinks deep into the boy heart and he thinks and dreams of the great and good man and as he thinks and dreams he spends his boyhood days gazing across the valley at a distant mountain side whose rocks and cliffs nature had formed into the outlines of a human face remarkable for the nobleness and benignity of its expression
he comes to love this face and looks upon it as the prototype of the coming wise man until lo
as he dwells upon it and dreams about it the beautiful character which its expression typifies grows into his own life and he himself becomes the wise man
the influence of more powerful than the influence of material environment however is that of other personalities upon us the touch of life upon life
a living personality contains a power which grips hold of us electrifies us inspires us and compels us to new endeavor or else degrades and debases us
none has failed to feel at some time this and to bless or curse the day when its influence came upon him
either consciously or unconsciously such a personality becomes our ideal and model we idolize it idealize it and imitate it until it becomes a part of us
not only do we find these great personalities living in the flesh but we find them also in books from whose pages they speak to us and to whose influence we respond
personalities alone does the power to influence reside
from which touches ours a stream of influence great or small is entering our life and helping to mold it
nor are we to forget that this influence is reciprocal and that we are reacting upon others up to the measure of the powers that are in us
the instinct of play small use to be a child unless one can play
says karl groos perhaps the very existence of youth is due in part to the necessity for play the animal does not play because he is young but he is young because he must play
play is a constant factor in all grades of animal life
the swarming insects the playful kitten the frisking lambs the racing colt the darting swallows the maddening aggregation of blackbirds these are but illustrations of the common impulse of all the animal world to play
wherever freedom and happiness reside there play is found wherever play is lacking there the curse has fallen and sadness and oppression reign
play is the natural r√¥le in the paradise of youth it is childhood chief occupation
to toil without play places man on a level with the beasts of burden
the necessity for but why is play so necessary
why is this impulse so in our natures
why not compel our young to expend their boundless energy on productive labor
why not shut recesses from our schools and so save time for work
is it true that all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
for proof we need but gaze at the dull and lifeless faces of the prematurely old children as they pour out of the factories where child labor is employed
we need but follow the children who have had a playless childhood into a narrow and barren manhood
we need but to trace back the history of the dull and brutish men of today and find that they were the playless children of yesterday
play is as necessary to the child as food as vital as sunshine as indispensable as air
the keynote of play is freedom of physical activity and mental initiative
in play the child makes his own plans his imagination has free rein originality is in demand and constructive ability is placed under tribute
here are developed a thousand tendencies which would never find expression in the narrow treadmill of labor alone
the child needs to learn to work but along with his work must be the opportunity for free and unrestricted activity which can come only through play
the boy needs a chance to be a barbarian a hero an indian
he needs to ride his broomstick on a dangerous raid and to charge with lath sword the redoubts of a stubborn enemy
he needs to be a leader as well as a follower
in short without in the least being aware of it he needs to develop himself through his own activity he needs freedom to play
if the child be a girl there is no difference except in the character of the activities employed
and it is precisely out of these play activities that the later and more serious activities of life emerge
play is the gateway by which we best enter the various fields of the world work whether our particular sphere be that of pupil or teacher in the schoolroom of man in the busy marts of trade or in the professions or of farmer or mechanic
play brings the into the activity it trains to habits of independence and individual initiative to strenuous and sustained effort to endurance of hardship and fatigue to social participation and the acceptance of victory and defeat
and these are the qualities needed by the man of success in his vocation
these facts make the play instinct one of the most important in education
froebel was the first to recognize the importance of play and the kindergarten was an attempt to utilize its activities in the school
the introduction of this new factor into education has been attended as might be expected by many mistakes
some have thought to recast the entire process of education into the form of games and plays and thus to lead the child to possess the promised land through aimlessly chasing butterflies in the pleasant fields of knowledge
it is needless to say that they have not succeeded
others have mistaken the shadow for the substance and introduced games and plays into the schoolroom which lack the very first element of play namely of initiative and on the part of the child
educational theorists and teachers have invented games and occupations and taught them to the children who go through with them much as they would with any other task enjoying the activity but missing the development which would come through a larger measure of
work and play are work can not take the place of play neither can play be substituted for work
nor are the two antagonistic but each is the complement of the other for the activities of work grow immediately out of those of play and each lends zest to the other
those who have never learned to work and those who have never learned to play are equally lacking in their development
further it is not the name or character of an activity which determines whether it is play for the participant but attitude toward the
if the activity is performed for its own sake and not for some ulterior end if it grows out of the interest of the child and involves the free and independent use of his powers of body and mind if it is and not someone else then the activity possesses the chief characteristics of play
lacking these it can not be play whatever else it may be
play like other instincts besides serving the present looks in two directions into the past and into the future
from the past come the shadowy interests which taking form from the touch of our environment determine the character of the play activities
from the future come the premonitions of the activities that are to be
the boy adjusting himself to the requirements of the game seeking control over his companions or giving in to them is practicing in miniature the larger game which he will play in business or profession a little later
the girl in her playhouse surrounded by a nondescript family of dolls and pets is unconsciously looking forward to a more perfect life when the responsibilities shall be a little more real
so let us not grudge our children the play day of youth
other useful instincts many other instincts ripen during the stage of youth and play their part in the development of the individual
it is inherent in every normal person to want to investigate and
the child looks out with wonder and fascination on a world he does not understand and at once begins to ask questions and try experiments
every new object is approached in a spirit of inquiry
interest is omnivorous feeding upon every phase of environment
nothing is too simple or too complex to demand attention and exploration so that it vitally touches the child activities and experience
the momentum given the individual by curiosity toward learning and mastering his world is incalculable
imagine the impossible task of teaching children what they had no desire or inclination to know
think of trying to lead them to investigate matters concerning which they felt only a supreme indifference
indeed one of the greatest problems of education is to keep curiosity alive and fresh so that its compelling influence may promote effort and action
one of the greatest secrets of eternal youth is also found in retaining the spontaneous curiosity of youth after the youthful years are past
this is the rather unsatisfactory name for the universal tendency to or something
the young child builds with its blocks constructs fences and pens and caves and houses and a score of other objects
the older child supplied with implements and tools enters upon more ambitious projects and revels in the joy of creation as he makes boats and boxes soldiers and swords kites and
even as adults we are moved by a desire to express ourselves through making or creating that which will represent our ingenuity and skill
the tendency of children to destroy is not from wantonness but rather from a desire to manipulate
education has but recently begun to make serious use of this important impulse
the success of all laboratory methods of teaching and of such subjects as manual training and domestic science is abundant proof of the adage that we learn by doing
we would rather construct or manipulate an object than merely learn its verbal description
our deepest impulses lead to creation rather than simple mental appropriation of facts and descriptions
the collecting the words and enter the child vocabulary at a very early age
the sense of property ownership and the impulse to make collections of various kinds go hand in hand
probably there are few of us who have not at one time or another made collections of autographs postage stamps coins bugs or some other thing of as little intrinsic value
and most of us if we have left youth behind are busy even now in seeking to collect fortunes works of art rare volumes or other objects on which we have set our hearts
the collecting instinct and the impulse to ownership can be made important agents in the school
the child who in nature study geography or agriculture is making a collection of the leaves plants soils fruits or insects used in the lessons has an incentive to observation and investigation impossible from book instruction alone
one who in manual training or domestic science is allowed to own the article made will give more effort and skill to its construction than if the work be done as a mere school task
the dramatic every person is at one stage of his development something of an actor
all children like to dress up and impersonate someone else in proof of which witness the many play scenes in which the character of nurse doctor pirate teacher merchant or explorer is taken by children who under the stimulus of their spontaneous imagery and as yet untrammeled by freely enter into the character they portray
the dramatic impulse never wholly dies out
when we no longer aspire to do the acting ourselves we have others do it for us in the theaters or the movies
education finds in the dramatic instinct a valuable aid
progressive teachers are using it freely especially in the teaching of literature and history
its application to these fields may be greatly increased and also extended more generally to include religion morals and art
the impulse to form gangs and few boys and girls grow up without belonging at some time to a secret gang club or society
usually this impulse grows out of two different instincts the and the
it is fundamental in our natures to wish to be with our kind not only our human kind but those of the same age interests and ambitions
the love of secrecy and adventure is also deep seated in us
so we are clannish and we love to do the unusual to break away from the commonplace and routine of our lives
there is often a thrill of satisfaction even if it be later followed by remorse in doing the forbidden or the unconventional
the problem here as in the case of many other instincts is one of guidance rather than of repression
out of the gang impulse we may develop our athletic teams our debating and dramatic clubs our tramping clubs and a score of other recreational benevolent or social organizations
not repression but proper expression should be our ideal
fear probably in no instinct more than in that of fear can we find the reflections of all the past ages of life in the world with its manifold changes its dangers its tragedies its sufferings and its deaths
fear the fears of childhood are remembered at every step and so are the fears through which the race has passed
says chamberlain every ugly thing told to the child every shock every fright given him will remain like splinters in the flesh to torture him all his life long
the bravest old soldier the most daring young reprobate is incapable of forgetting them all the masks the bogies ogres hobgoblins witches and wizards the things that bite and scratch that nip and tear that pinch and crunch the thousand and one imaginary monsters of the mother the nurse or the servant have had their effect and hundreds of generations have worked to denaturalize the brains of children
perhaps no animal not even those most susceptible to fright has behind it the fear heredity of the child
president hall calls attention to the fact that night is now the safest time of the hours serpents are no longer our most deadly enemies strangers are not to be feared neither are big eyes or teeth there is no adequate reason why the wind or thunder or lightning should make children frantic as they do
but the past of man forever seems to linger in his present and the child in being afraid of these things is only summing up the fear experiences of the race and suffering all too many of them in his short childhood
fear of the most children are afraid in the dark
who does not remember the terror of a dark room through which he had to pass or worse still in which he had to go to bed alone and there lie in cold perspiration induced by a mortal agony of fright
the unused doors which would not lock and through which he expected to see the goblin come forth to get him
the dark shadows back under the bed where he was afraid to look for the hidden monster which he was sure was hiding there and yet dare not face
the lonely lane through which the cows were to be driven late at night while every fence corner bristled with shapeless monsters lying in wait for boys
and that hated dark closet where he was shut up until he could learn to be good
and the useless trapdoor in the ceiling
how often have we lain in the dim light at night and seen the lid lift just a peep for ogre eyes to peer out and when the terror was growing beyond endurance close down only to lift once and again until from sheer weariness and exhaustion we fell into a troubled sleep and dreamed of the hideous monster which inhabited the unused garret
tell me that the old trapdoor never bent its hinges in response to either man or monster for twenty years
i know it is true and yet i am not convinced
my childish fears have left a stronger impression than proof of mere facts can ever overrule
fear of being left and the fear of being left alone
how big and dreadful the house seemed with the folks all gone
how we suddenly made close friends with the dog or the cat even in order that this bit of life might be near us
or failing in this we have gone out to the barn among the chickens and the pigs and the cows and deserted the empty house with its torture of loneliness
what was there so terrible in being alone
i know only that to many children it is a torture more exquisite than the adult organism is fitted to experience
but why multiply the recollections
they bring a tremor to the strongest of us today
who of us would choose to live through those childish fears again
dream fears fears of animals fears of furry things fears of ghosts and of death dread of fatal diseases fears of fire and of water of strange persons of storms fears of things unknown and even unimagined but all the more fearful
would you all like to relive your childhood for its pleasures if you had to take along with them its sufferings
would the race choose to live its evolution over again
but for my own part i should very much hesitate to turn the hands of time backward in either case
would that the adults at life noonday in remembering the childish fears of life morning might feel a sympathy for the children of today who are not yet escaped from the bonds of the fear instinct
would that all might seek to quiet every foolish childish fear instead of laughing at it or enhancing it
other undesirable instincts we are all provided by nature with some instincts which while they may serve a good purpose in our development need to be suppressed or at least modified when they have done their work
all children and perhaps all adults are selfish
the little child will appropriate all the candy and give none to his playmate
he will grow angry and fight rather than allow brother or sister to use a favorite plaything
he will demand the mother attention and care even when told that she is tired or ill and not able to minister to him
but all of this is true to nature and though it needs to be changed to generosity and unselfishness is after all a vital factor in our natures
for it is better in the long run that each one look out for himself rather than to be so careless of his own interests and needs as to require help from others
the problem in education is so to balance selfishness and greed with unselfishness and generosity that each serves as a check and a balance to the other
not elimination but equilibrium is to be our watchword
pugnacity or the fighting almost every normal child is a natural fighter just as every adult should possess the spirit of conquest
the long history of conflict through which our race has come has left its mark in our love of combat
the pugnacity of children especially of boys is not so much to be deprecated and suppressed as guided into right lines and rendered subject to right ideals
the boy who picks a quarrel has been done a kindness when given a drubbing that will check this tendency
on the other hand one who risks battle in defense of a weaker comrade does no ignoble thing
children need very early to be taught the baseness of fighting for the sake of conflict and the glory of going down to defeat fighting in a righteous cause
the world could well stand more of this spirit among adults
let us then hear the conclusion of the whole matter
the undesirable instincts do not need encouragement
it is better to let them fade away from disuse or in some cases even by attaching punishment to their expression
they are echoes from a distant past and not serviceable in this better present
the desirable instincts we are to seize upon and utilize as starting points for the development of useful interests good habits and the higher emotional life
we should take them as they come for their appearance is a sure sign that the organism is ready for and needs the activity they foreshadow and furthermore if they are not used when they present themselves they disappear never to return
what instincts have you noticed developing in children
what ones have you observed to fade away
can you fix the age in both cases
apply these questions to your own development as you remember it or can get it by tradition from your elders
what use of imitation may be made in teaching  literature  composition  music  good manners  morals
make a list of the games you think all children should know and be able to play
it has been said that it is as important for a people to be able to use their leisure time wisely as to use their work time profitably
observe the instruction of children to discover the extent to which use is made of the instinct
describe a plan by which each of these instincts can be successfully used in some branch of study
what examples can you recount from your own experience of conscious imitation
of the influence of environment
what is the application of the preceding question to the esthetic quality of our school buildings
have you ever observed that children under a dozen years of age usually can not be depended upon for team work in their games
in the psychical world as well as the physical we must meet and overcome inertia
our lives must be compelled by motive forces strong enough to overcome this natural inertia and enable us besides to make headway against many obstacles
the motive power that drives us consists chiefly of our feelings and emotions
knowledge cognition supplies the rudder that guides our ship but feeling and emotion supply the power
to convince one head is therefore not enough his feelings must be stirred if you would be sure of moving him to action
often have we that a certain line of action was right but failed to follow it because feeling led in a different direction
when decision has been hanging in the balance we have piled on one side obligation duty sense of right and a dozen other reasons for action only to have them all outweighed by the one single
judgment reason and experience may unite to tell us that a contemplated course is unwise and imagination may reveal to us its disastrous consequences and yet its pleasures so appeal to us that we yield
our feelings often prove a stronger motive than knowledge and will combined they are a factor constantly to be reckoned with among our motives
the nature of feeling it will be our purpose in the next few chapters to study the content of consciousness the feelings and emotions
the present chapter will be devoted to the feelings and the one that follows to the emotions
the different feeling at least six some writers say even more distinct and qualitatively different feeling states are easily distinguished
pleasure and pain and desire and repugnance are directly opposite or antagonistic feelings
interest and apathy are not opposites in a similar way since apathy is but the absence of interest and not its antagonist
in place of the terms pleasure and pain the and the or the
is frequently employed as a synonym for repugnance
it is somewhat hard to believe on first thought that feeling comprises but the classes given
for have we not often felt the pain from a toothache from not being able to take a trip from the loss of a dear friend
surely these are very different classes of feelings
likewise we have been happy from the very joy of living from being praised for some or from the presence of friend or lover
and here again we seem to have widely different classes of feelings
we must remember however that feeling is always based on something
it never appears alone in consciousness as pleasures or pains
the mind must have something about which to feel
what we commonly call a feeling a complex state of consciousness in which feeling but which has nevertheless basis of sensation or memory or some other cognitive
and what so greatly varies in the different cases of the illustrations just given is precisely this knowledge element and not the feeling element
a feeling of unpleasantness is a feeling of unpleasantness whether it comes from an aching tooth or from the loss of a friend
it may differ in degree and the entire mental states of which the feeling is a part may differ vastly but the simple feeling itself is of the same quality
feeling always present in mental no phase of our mental life is without the feeling element
we look at the rainbow with its beautiful and harmonious blending of colors and a feeling of pleasure accompanies the sensation then we turn and gaze at the glaring sun and a disagreeable feeling is the result
a strong feeling of pleasantness accompanies the experience of the voluptuous warmth of a cozy bed on a cold morning but the plunge between the icy sheets on the preceding evening was accompanied by the opposite feeling
the touch of a hand may occasion a thrill of ecstatic pleasure or it may be accompanied by a feeling equally disagreeable
and so on through the whole range of sensation we not only
the various objects about us through sensation and perception but we also while we know
cognition or the knowing processes gives us our whats and feeling or the affective processes gives us our hows what is yonder object
if instead of the simpler sensory processes which we have just considered we take the more complex processes such as memory imagination and thinking the case is no different
who has not reveled in the pleasure accompanying the memories of past joys
on the other hand who is free from all unpleasant memories from regrets from pangs of remorse
who has not dreamed away an hour in pleasant anticipation of some desired object or spent a miserable hour in dreading some calamity which imagination pictured to him
feeling also accompanies our thought processes
everyone has experienced the feeling of the pleasure of intellectual victory over some difficult problem which had baffled the reason or over some doubtful case in which our judgment proved correct
and likewise none has escaped the feeling of unpleasantness which accompanies intellectual defeat
whatever the contents of our mental stream we find in them everywhere present a certain color of passing estimate an immediate sense that they are worth something to us at any given moment or that they then have an interest to us
the seeming neutral feeling it is probable that there is so little feeling connected with many of the humdrum and habitual experiences of our everyday lives that we are but slightly if at all aware of a feeling state in connection with them
yet a state of consciousness with absolutely no feeling side to it is as unthinkable as the obverse side of a coin without the reverse
some sort of feeling tone or mood is always present
the width of the affective neutral zone that is of a feeling state so little marked as not to be discriminated as either pleasure or pain desire or aversion varies with different persons and with the same person at different times
it is conditioned largely by the amount of attention given in the direction of feeling and also on the fineness of the power of feeling discrimination
it is safe to say that the zero range is usually so small as to be negligible
the sum total of all the feeling accompanying the various sensory and thought processes at any given time results in what we may call our mood
how mood is during most of our waking hours and indeed during our sleeping hours as well a multitude of sensory currents are pouring into the cortical centers
at the present moment we can hear the rumble of a wagon the chirp of a cricket the chatter of distant voices and a hundred other sounds besides
at the same time the eye is appealed to by an infinite variety of stimuli in light color and objects the skin responds to many contacts and temperatures and every other type of of the body is acting as a sender to telegraph a message in to the brain
add to these the powerful currents which are constantly being sent to the cortex from the visceral organs those of respiration of circulation of digestion and assimilation
and then finally add the central processes which accompany the flight of images through our minds our meditations memories and imaginations our cogitations and volitions
thus we see what a complex our feelings must be and how impossible to have any moment in which some feeling is not present as a part of our mental stream
it is this complex now made up chiefly on the basis of the sensory currents coming in from the or the visceral organs and now on the basis of those in the cortex connected with our thought life which constitutes the entire feeling tone or
mood colors all our mood depends on the character of the aggregate of nerve currents entering the cortex and changes as the character of the current varies
if the currents run on much the same from hour to hour then our mood is correspondingly constant if the currents are variable our mood also will be variable
not only is mood dependent on our sensations and thoughts for its quality but it in turn colors our entire mental life
it serves as a background or setting whose hue is reflected over all our thinking
let the mood be somber and dark and all the world looks gloomy on the other hand let the mood be bright and cheerful and the world puts on a smile
it is told of one of the early circuit riders among the new england ministry that he made the following entries in his diary thus well illustrating the point eve
brown late this evening hungry and tired after a long day in the saddle
had a bountiful supper of cold pork and beans warm bread bacon and eggs coffee and rich pastry
i go to rest feeling that my witness is clear the future is bright i feel called to a great and glorious work in this place
the next entry was as follows thur morn
awakened late this morning after a troubled night
i am very much depressed in soul the way looks dark far from feeling called to work among this people i am beginning to doubt the safety of my own soul
brown and his family are set too much on carnal things
a dyspeptic is usually a pessimist and an optimist always keeps a bright mood
mood influences our judgments and the prattle of children may be grateful music to our ears when we are in one mood and excruciatingly discordant noise when we are in another
what appeals to us as a good practical joke one day may seem a piece of unwarranted impertinence on another
a proposition which looks entirely plausible under the sanguine mood induced by a persuasive orator may appear wholly untenable a few hours later
decisions which seemed warranted when we were in an angry mood often appear unwise or unjust when we have become more calm
motives which easily impel us to action when the world looks bright fail to move us when the mood is somber
the feelings of impending peril and calamity which are an inevitable accompaniment of the blues are speedily dissipated when the sun breaks through the clouds and we are ourselves again
mood influences a bright and hopeful mood quickens every power and enhances every effort while a hopeless mood limits power and cripples effort
the football team which goes into the game discouraged never plays to the limit
the student who attacks his lesson under the conviction of defeat can hardly hope to succeed while the one who enters upon his work confident of his power to master it has the battle already half won
the world best work is done not by those who live in the shadow of discouragement and doubt but by those in whose breast hope springs eternal
the optimist is a benefactor of the race if for no other reason than the sheer contagion of his hopeful spirit the pessimist contributes neither to the world welfare nor its happiness
youth proverbial enthusiasm and dauntless energy rest upon the supreme hopefulness which characterizes the mood of the young
for these reasons if for no other the mood of the schoolroom should be one of happiness and good cheer
disposition a resultant of the sum total of our moods gives us our
whether these are pleasant or unpleasant cheerful or gloomy will depend on the predominating character of the moods which enter into them
as well expect to gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles as to secure a desirable disposition out of undesirable moods
a sunny disposition never comes from gloomy moods nor a hopeful one out of the blues
and it is our disposition more than the power of our reason which after all determines our desirability as friends and companions
the person of surly disposition can hardly make a desirable companion no matter what his intellectual qualities may be
we may live very happily with one who can not follow the reasoning of a newton but it is hard to live with a person chronically subject to black moods
nor can we put the responsibility for our disposition off on our ancestors
it is not an inheritance but a growth
slowly day by day and mood by mood we build up our disposition until finally it comes to characterize us
some are however more predisposed to certain types of mood than are others
the organization of our nervous system which we get through heredity undoubtedly has much to do with the feeling tone into which we most easily fall
on the effects of temperament our ancestors must divide the responsibility with us
the responsibility for even if we find ourselves predisposed toward a certain undesirable type of moods there is no reason why we should give up to them
even in spite of hereditary predispositions we can still largely determine for ourselves what our moods are to be
if we have a tendency toward cheerful quiet and optimistic moods the psychologist names our temperament the if we are tense easily excited and irritable with a tendency toward sullen or angry moods the if we are given to frequent fits of the blues if we usually look on the dark side of things and have a tendency toward moods of discouragement and the dumps the if hard to rouse and given to indolent and indifferent moods the
whatever be our temperament it is one of the most important factors in our character
permanent feeling attitudes or sentiments besides the more or less transitory feeling states which we have called moods there exists also a class of feeling attitudes which contain more of the complex intellectual element are withal of rather a higher nature and much more permanent than our moods
our sentiments comprise the somewhat constant level of feeling combined with cognition which we name
like our dispositions our sentiments are a growth of months and years
unlike our dispositions however our sentiments are relatively independent of the physiological undertone and depend more largely upon experience and intellectual elements as a basis
a sluggish liver might throw us into an irritable mood and if the condition were long continued might result in a surly disposition but it would hardly permanently destroy one patriotism and make him turn traitor to his country
one feeling attitude on such matters is too deep seated to be modified by changing whims
how sentiments sentiments have their beginning in concrete experiences in which feeling is a predominant element and grow through the multiplication of these experiences much as the concept is developed through many percepts
there is a residual element left behind each separate experience in both cases
in the case of the concept the residual element is intellectual and in the case of the sentiment it is a complex in which the feeling element is predominant
how this comes about is easily seen by means of an illustration or two
the mother feeds her child when he is hungry and an agreeable feeling is produced she puts him into the bath and snuggles him in her arms and the experiences are pleasant
the child comes to look upon the mother as one whose especial function is to make things pleasant for him so he comes to be happy in her presence and long for her in her absence
he finally grows to love his mother not alone for the countless times she has given him pleasure but for what she herself is
the feelings connected at first wholly with pleasant experiences coming through the ministrations of the mother strengthened no doubt by instinctive tendencies toward affection and later enhanced by a fuller realization of what a mother care and sacrifice mean grow at last into a deep forceful abiding sentiment of love for the mother
the effect of likewise with the sentiment of patriotism
in so far as our patriotism is a true patriotism and not a noisy clamor it had its rise in feelings of gratitude and love when we contemplated the deeds of heroism and sacrifice for the flag and the blessings which come to us from our relations as citizens to our country
if we have had concrete cases brought to our experience as for example our property saved from destruction at the hands of a mob or our lives saved from a hostile foreign foe the patriotic sentiment will be all the stronger
so we may carry the illustration into all the sentiments
our religious sentiments of adoration love and faith have their origin in our belief in the care love and support from a higher being typified to us as children by the care love and support of our parents
pride arises from the appreciation or of oneself his attainments or his belongings
selfishness has its genesis in the many instances in which pleasure results from ministering to self
in all these cases it is seen that our sentiments develop out of our experiences they are the permanent but results which we have to show for experiences which are somewhat long continued and in which a certain feeling quality is a strong accompaniment of the cognitive part of the experience
the influence of our sentiments like our dispositions are not only a natural growth from the experiences upon which they are fed but they in turn have large influence in determining the direction of our further development
our sentiments furnish the soil which is either favorable or hostile to the growth of new experiences
one in whom the sentiment of true patriotism is will find it much harder to respond to a suggestion to betray his country honor on battlefield in legislative hall or in private life than one lacking in this sentiment
the boy who has a strong sentiment of love for his mother will find this a restraining influence in the face of temptation to commit deeds which would wound her feelings
a deep and abiding faith in god is fatal to the growth of pessimism distrust and a life
one sentiments are a safe gauge of his character
let us know a man attitude or sentiments on religion morality friendship honesty and the other great questions of life and little remains to be known
if he is right on these he may well be trusted in other things if he is wrong on these there is little to build upon
literature has drawn its best inspiration and choicest themes from the field of our sentiments
the sentiment of friendship has given us our david and jonathan our damon and pythias and our tennyson and hallam
the sentiment of love has inspired countless masterpieces without its aid most of our fiction would lose its plot and most of our poetry its charm
religious sentiment inspired milton to write the world greatest epic paradise lost
the sentiment of patriotism has furnished an inexhaustible theme for the writer and the orator
likewise if we go into the field of music and art we find that the best efforts of the masters are clustered around some human sentiment which has appealed to them and which they have immortalized by expressing it on canvas or in marble that it may appeal to others and cause the sentiment to grow in us
sentiments as the sentiments furnish the deepest the most constant and the most powerful motives which control our lives
such sentiments as patriotism liberty and religion have called a thousand armies to struggle and die on ten thousand battlefields and have given martyrs courage to suffer in the fires of persecution
sentiments of friendship and love have prompted countless deeds of and loving devotion
sentiments of envy pride and jealousy have changed the boundary lines of nations and have prompted the committing of ten thousand unnamable crimes
slowly day by day from the cradle to the grave we are weaving into our lives the threads of sentiment which at last become so many cables to bind us to good or evil

chapter xv the emotions feeling and emotion are not to be looked upon as two different
in fact emotion is but feeling state of a high degree of intensity and
emotion transcends the simpler feeling states whenever the exciting cause is sufficient to throw us out of our regular routine of affective experience
the distinction between emotion and feeling is a purely arbitrary one since the difference is only one of complexity and degree and many feelings may rise to the intensity of emotions
a feeling of sadness on hearing of a number of fatalities in a railway accident may suddenly become an emotion of grief if we learn that a member of our family is among those killed
a feeling of gladness may develop into an emotion of joy or a feeling of resentment be kindled into an emotion of rage
the producing and expressing of emotion nowhere more than in connection with our emotions are the close of mind and body seen
all are familiar with the fact that the emotion of anger tends to find expression in the blow love in the caress fear in flight and so on
but just how our organism acts in an emotion is less generally understood
professor james and professor lange have shown us that emotion not only tends to produce some characteristic form of response but that
the emotion is itself caused by certain physiological
let us seek to understand this statement a little more fully
physiological explanation of we must remember first of all that changes in mental states are accompanied by corresponding physiological changes
hard concentrated thinking quickens the heart beat keen attention is accompanied by muscular tension certain sights or sounds increase the rate of breathing offensive odors produce nausea and so on
so complete and perfect is the response of our physical organism to mental changes that one psychologist declares it possible had we sufficiently delicate apparatus to measure the reactions caused throughout the body of a sleeping child by the shadow from a passing cloud falling upon the closed eyelids
the order of the entire event resulting in an emotion is as follows  something is some object enters consciousness coming either from immediate perception or through memory or imagination
this fact or thing known must be of such nature that it will  set up and characteristic  the feeling and caused by these physiological reactions constitutes the
for example we may be passing along the street in a perfectly calm and equable state of mind when we come upon a teamster who is brutally beating an exhausted horse because it is unable to draw an overloaded wagon up a slippery incline
the facts grasped as we take in the situation constitute the element in an emotional response developing in our consciousness
but instantly our muscles begin to grow tense the heart beat and breath quicken the face takes on a different expression the hands clench the entire organism is reacting to the disturbing situation the factor in the rising emotion the physiological response thus appears
along with our apprehension of the cruelty and the organic disturbances which result we feel waves of indignation and anger surging through us
this is the factor in the emotional event or the emotion itself
in some such way as this are all of our emotions aroused
origin of characteristic emotional why do certain facts or objects of consciousness always cause certain characteristic organic responses
in order to solve this problem we shall have first to go beyond the individual and appeal to the history of the race
what the race has found serviceable the individual repeats
but even then it is hard to see why the particular type of physical response such as shrinking pallor and trembling which naturally follow stimuli threatening harm should be the best
it is easy to see however that the feeling which prompts to flight or serves to deter from harm way might be useful
it is plain that there is an advantage in the tense muscle the set teeth the held breath and the quickened pulse which accompany the emotion of anger and also in the feeling of anger itself which prompts to the conflict
but even if we are not able in every case to determine at this day why all the instinctive responses and their correlate of feeling were the best for the life of the race we may be sure that such was the case for nature is inexorable in her dictates that only that shall persist which has proved serviceable in the largest number of cases
an interesting question arises at this point as to why we feel emotion accompanying some of our motor responses and not others
perceptions are crowding in upon us hour after hour memory thought and imagination are in constant play and a continuous motor discharge results each moment in physical expressions great or small
yet in spite of these facts feeling which is strong enough to rise to an emotion is only an occasional thing
if emotion accompanies any form of physical expression why not all
let us see whether we can discover any reason
one day i saw a boy leading a dog along the street
all at once the dog slipped the string over its head and ran away
the boy stood looking after the dog for a moment and then burst into a fit of rage
the moment before the dog broke away everything was running smoothly in the experience of the boy
there was no obstruction to his thought or his plans
then in an instant the situation changes
the smooth flow of experience is checked and baffled
the discharge of nerve currents which meant thought plans action is blocked
a crisis has arisen which requires readjustment
the nerve currents must flow in new directions giving new thought new plans new activities the dog must be recaptured
it is in connection with this damming up of nerve currents from following their wonted channels that the emotion emerges
or putting it into mental terms the emotion occurs when the ordinary current of our thought is violently disturbed when we meet with some crisis which necessitates a readjustment of our thought relations and plans either temporarily or permanently
the duration of an if the required readjustment is but temporary then the emotion is while if the readjustment is necessarily of longer duration the emotion also will live longer
the fear which follows the thunder is relatively brief for the shock is gone in a moment and our thought is but temporarily disturbed
if the impending danger is one that persists however as of some secret assassin threatening our life the fear also will persist
the grief of a child over the loss of someone dear to him is comparatively short because the current of the child life has not been so closely bound up in a complexity of experiences with the lost object as in the case of an older person and hence the readjustment is easier
the grief of an adult over the loss of a very dear friend lasts long for the object grieved over has so become a part of the bereaved one experience that the loss requires a very complete readjustment of the whole life
in either case however as this readjustment is accomplished the emotion gradually fades away
emotions accompanying crises in if our description of the feelings has been correct it will be seen that the simpler and milder feelings are for the common run of our everyday experience they are the common valuers of our thought and acts from hour to hour
the emotions or more intense feeling states are however the occasional high tide of feeling which occurs in crises or emergencies
we are angry on some particular provocation we fear some extraordinary factor in our environment we are joyful over some unusual good fortune
the control of emotions dependence on since all emotions rest upon some form of physical or physiological expression primarily and upon some thought back of this secondarily it follows that the first step in controlling an emotion is to secure
the removal of the state of which serves as its basis
this may be done for instance with a child either by banishing the terrifying dog from his presence or by convincing him that the dog is harmless
the motor response will then cease and the emotion pass away
if the thought is persistent however through the continuance of its stimulus then what remains is to seek to control the physical expression and in that way suppress the emotion
if instead of the knit brow the tense muscles the quickened heart beat and all the deeper organic changes which go along with these we can keep a smile on the face the muscles relaxed the heart beat steady and a normal condition in all the other organs we shall have no cause to fear an explosion of anger
if we are afraid of mice and feel an almost irresistible tendency to mount a chair every time we see a mouse we can do wonders in suppressing the fear by resolutely refusing to give expression to these tendencies
inhibition of the expression inevitably means the death of the emotion
this fact has its bad side as well as its good in the feeling life for it means that good emotions as well as bad will fade out if we fail to allow them expression
we are all perfectly familiar with the fact in our own experience that an interest which does not find means of expression soon passes away
sympathy unexpressed ere long passes over into indifference
even love can not live without expression
religious emotion which does not go out in deeds of service can not persist
the natural end and aim of our emotions is to serve as motives to activity and missing this opportunity they have not only failed in their office but will themselves die of inaction
relief through emotional states not only have their rise in organic reactions but they also tend to result in acts
when we are angry or in love or in fear we have the impulse do something about
and while it is true that emotion may be inhibited by suppressing the physical expressions on which it is founded so may a state of emotional tension be relieved by some forms of expression
none have failed to experience the relief which comes to the overcharged nervous system from a good cry
there is no sorrow so bitter as a dry sorrow when one can not weep
a state of anger or annoyance is relieved by an explosion of some kind whether in a blow or its equivalent in speech
we often feel better when we have told a man what we think of him
at first glance this all seems opposed to what we have been laying down as the explanation of emotion
yet it is not so if we look well into the case
we have already seen that emotion occurs when there is a blocking of the usual pathways of discharge for the nerve currents which must then seek new outlets and thus result in the setting up of new motor responses
in the case of grief for example there is a disturbance in the whole organism the heart beat is deranged the blood pressure diminished and the nerve tone lowered
what is needed is for the currents which are finding an outlet in directions resulting in these particular responses to find a pathway of discharge which will not produce such results
the energy thus expended is diverted from producing internal disturbances
likewise the explosion in anger may serve to restore the equilibrium of disturbed nerve currents
relief does not follow if image is held before the all this is true however only when the expression does not serve to keep the idea before the mind which was originally responsible for the emotion
a person may work himself into a passion of anger by beginning to talk about an insult and as he grows increasingly violent bringing the situation more and more sharply into his consciousness
the effect of terrifying images is easily to be observed in the case of one starting to run when he is afraid after night
there is probably no doubt that the running would relieve his fear providing he could do it and not picture the threatening something as pursuing him
but with his imagination conjuring up dire images of frightful catastrophes at every step all control is lost and fresh waves of terror surge over the shrinking soul
growing tendency toward emotional among civilized peoples there is a constantly growing tendency toward emotional control
primitive races express grief joy fear or anger much more freely than do civilized races
this does not mean that primitive man feels more deeply than civilized man for as we have already seen the crying laughing or blustering is but a small part of the whole physical expression and one entire organism may be stirred to its depths without any of these outward manifestations
man has found it advisable as he has advanced in civilization not to reveal all he feels to those around him
the face which is the most expressive part of the body has come to be under such perfect control that it is hard to read through it the emotional state although the face of civilized man is capable of expressing far more than is that of the savage
the same difference is observable between the child and the adult
the child reveals each passing shade of emotion through his expression while the adult may feel much that he does not show
there is no other mental factor which has more to do with the enjoyment we get out of life than our feelings and emotions
the emotions and few of us would care to live at all if all feeling were eliminated from human experience
true feeling often makes us suffer but in so far as life joys triumph over its woes do our feelings minister to our enjoyment
without sympathy love and appreciation life would be barren indeed
moreover it is only through our own emotional experience that we are able to interpret the feeling side of the lives about us
failing in this we miss one of the most significant phases of social experience and are left with our own sympathies undeveloped and our life by so much impoverished
the interpretation of the subtler emotions of those about us is in no small degree an art
the human face and form present a constantly changing panorama of the soul feeling states to those who can read their signs
the ability to read the finer feelings which reveal themselves in expression too delicate to be read by the eye of the gross or unsympathetic observer lies at the basis of all fine interpretation of personality
feelings are often too deep for outward expression and we are slow to reveal our deepest selves to those who can not appreciate and understand them
how emotions emotions are to be cultivated as the intellect or the muscles are to be cultivated namely through proper exercise
our thought is to dwell on those things to which proper emotions attach and to shun lines which would suggest emotions of an undesirable type
emotions which are to be developed must as has already been said find expression we must act in response to their leadings else they become but idle vaporings
if love prompts us to say a kind word to a suffering fellow mortal the word must be spoken or the feeling itself fades away
on the other hand the emotions which we wish to suppress are to be refused expression
the unkind and cutting word is to be left unsaid when we are angry and the fear of things which are harmless left unexpressed and thereby doomed to die
the emotional factor in our much material for the cultivation of our emotions lies in the everyday life all about us if we can but interpret it
few indeed of those whom we meet daily but are hungering for appreciation and sympathy
lovable traits exist in every character and will reveal themselves to the one who looks for them
miscarriages of justice abound on all sides and demand our indignation and wrath and the effort to right the wrong
evil always exists to be hated and suppressed and dangers to be feared and avoided
human life and the movement of human affairs constantly appeal to the feeling side of our nature if we understand at all what life and action mean
a certain blindness exists in many people however which makes our own little joys or sorrows or fears the most remarkable ones in the world and keeps us from realizing that others may feel as deeply as we
of course this attitude of mind is fatal to any true cultivation of the emotions
it leads to an emotional life which lacks not only breadth and depth but also perspective
literature and the cultivation of the in order to increase our facility in the interpretation of the emotions through teaching us what to look for in life and experience we may go to literature
here we find life interpreted for us in the ideal by masters of interpretation and looking through their eyes we see new depths and breadths of feeling which we had never before discovered
indeed literature deals far more in the aggregate with the feeling side than with any other aspect of human life
and it is just this which makes literature a universal language for the language of our emotions is more easily interpreted than that of our reason
the smile the cry the laugh the frown the caress are understood all around the world among all peoples
there is always this danger to be avoided however
we may become so taken up with the overwrought descriptions of the emotions as found in literature or on the stage that the common humdrum of everyday life around us seems flat and stale
the interpretation of the writer or the actor is far beyond what we are able to make for ourselves so we take their interpretation rather than trouble ourselves to look in our own environment for the material which might appeal to our emotions
it is not rare to find those who easily weep over the woes of an imaginary person in a book or on the stage unable to feel sympathy for the real suffering which exists all around them
the story is told of a lady at the theater who wept over the suffering of the hero in the play and at the moment she was shedding the unnecessary tears her own coachman whom she had compelled to wait for her in the street was frozen to death
our seemingly prosaic environment is full of suggestions to the emotional life and books and plays should only help to develop in us the power rightly to respond to these suggestions
harm in emotional danger may exist also in still another line namely that of emotional overexcitement
there is a great nervous strain in high emotional tension
nothing is more exhausting than a severe fit of anger it leaves its victim weak and limp
a severe case of fright often incapacitates one for mental or physical labor for hours or it may even result in permanent injury
the whole nervous tone is distinctly lowered by sorrow and even excessive joy may be harmful
in our actual everyday life there is little danger from emotional overexcitement unless it be in the case of fear in children as was shown in the discussion on instincts and in that of grief over the loss of objects that are dear to us
most of our childish fears we could just as well avoid if our elders were wiser in the matter of guarding us against those that are unnecessary
the griefs we can not hope to escape although we can do much to control them
emotional excitement unless it is followed by corresponding activity gives us those who weep over the wrongs of humanity but never do anything to right them who are sorry to the point of death over human suffering but can not be induced to lend their aid to its alleviation
we could very well spare a thousand of those in the world who merely feel for one who acts james tells us
we should watch then that our good feelings do not simply evaporate as feelings but that they find some place to apply themselves to accomplish good that we do not like hamlet rave over wrongs which need to be righted but never bring ourselves to the point where we take a hand in their righting
if our emotional life is to be rich and deep in its feeling and effective in its results on our acts and character it must find its outlet in deeds
emotions as motives emotion is always dynamic and our feelings constitute our strongest motives to action and achievement
how our emotions compel love has often done in the reformation of a fallen life what strength of will was not able to accomplish it has caused dynasties to fall and has changed the map of nations
hatred is a motive hardly less strong
fear will make savage beasts out of men who fall under its sway causing them to trample helpless women and children under feet whom in their saner moments they would protect with their lives
anger puts out all the light of reason and prompts peaceful and men to commit murderous acts
thus feeling from the faintest and simplest feeling of interest the various ranges of pleasures and pain the sentiments which underlie all our lives and so on to the mighty emotions which grip our lives with an overpowering strength constitutes a large part of the motive power which is constantly urging us on to do and dare
hence it is important from this standpoint also that we should have the right type of feelings and emotions well developed and the undesirable ones eliminated
emotional emotion and feeling are partly matters of habit
that is we can form emotional as well as other habits and they are as hard to break
anger allowed to run uncontrolled leads into habits of angry outbursts while the one who habitually controls his temper finds it submitting to the habit of remaining within bounds
one may cultivate the habit of showing his fear on all occasions or of discouraging its expression
he may form the habit of jealousy or of confidence
it is possible even to form the habit of falling in love or of so suppressing the tender emotions that love finds little opportunity for expression
and here as elsewhere habits are formed through performing the acts upon which the habit rests
if there are emotional habits we are desirous of forming what we have to do is to indulge the emotional expression of the type we desire and the habit will follow
if we wish to form the habit of living in a chronic state of the blues then all we have to do is to be blue and act blue sufficiently and this form of emotional expression will become a part of us
if we desire to form the habit of living in a happy cheerful state we can accomplish this by encouraging the corresponding expression
what are the characteristic bodily expressions by which you can recognize a state of anger
do you know persons who are inclined to be too expressive emotionally
who show too little emotional expression
how would you classify yourself in this respect
are you naturally responsive to the emotional tone of others that is are you sympathetic
are you easily affected by reading emotional books
by emotional plays or other appeals
what is the danger from overexciting the emotions without giving them a proper outlet in some practical activity
have you observed a tendency among adults not to take seriously the emotions of a child for example to look upon childish grief as trivial or fear as something to be laughed at
is the child emotional life as real as that of the adult
see ch ix betts fathers and mothers
have you known children to repress their emotions for fear of being laughed at
have you known parents or others to remark about childish love affairs to the children themselves in a light or joking way
note certain children who give way to fits of anger what is the remedy
note other children who cry readily what would you suggest as a cure
why should ridicule not be used
have you observed any teacher using the lesson in literature or history to cultivate the finer emotions
what emotions have you seen appealed to by a lesson in nature study
what emotions have you observed on the playground that needed restraint
do you think that on the whole the emotional life of the child receives enough consideration in the school
the feeling that we call interest is so important a motive in our lives and so colors our acts and gives direction to our endeavors that we will do well to devote a chapter to its discussion
the nature of interest we saw in an earlier chapter that personal habits have their rise in race habits or instincts
let us now see how interest helps the individual to select from his instinctive acts those which are useful to build into personal habits
instinct impartially starts the child in the performance of many different activities but does not dictate what particular acts shall be retained to serve as the basis for habits
interest comes in at this point and says this act is of more value than that act continue this act and drop that
instinct prompts the babe to countless movements of body and limb
interest picks out those that are most vitally connected with the welfare of the organism and the child comes to prefer these rather than the others
thus it is that out of the random movements of arms and legs and head and body we finally develop the co√∂rdinated activities which are infinitely more useful than the random ones were
and these activities originating in instincts and selected by interest are soon crystallized into habits
the same truth holds for mental activities as for physical
a thousand channels lie open for your stream of thought at this moment but your interest has beckoned it into the one particular channel which for the time at least appears to be of the greatest subjective value and it is now following that channel unless your will has compelled it to leave that for another
your thinking as naturally follows your interest as the needle does the magnet hence your thought activities are conditioned largely by your interests
this is equivalent to saying that your mental habits rest back finally upon your interests
everyone knows what it is to be interested but interest like other elementary states of consciousness can not be rigidly defined
subjectively considered interest may be looked upon as feeling attitude which assigns our activities their place in a subjective scale of and hence selects among them
objectively considered an interest is object which calls forth the
functionally considered interest is dynamic phase of
interest supplies a subjective scale of if you are interested in driving a horse rather than in riding a bicycle it is because the former has a greater subjective value to you than the latter
if you are interested in reading these words instead of thinking about the next social function or the last picnic party it is because at this moment the thought suggested appeals to you as of more value than the other lines of thought
from this it follows that your standards of values are revealed in the character of your interests
the young man who is interested in the race track in gaming and in low resorts confesses by the fact that these things occupy a high place among the things which appeal to him as subjectively valuable
the mother whose interests are chiefly in clubs and other social organizations places these higher in her scale of values than her home
the reader who can become interested only in light trashy literature must admit that matter of this type ranks higher in his subjective scale of values than the works of the masters
teachers and students whose strongest interest is in grade marks value these more highly than true attainment
for whatever may be our claims or assertions interest is finally an infallible barometer of the values we assign to our activities
in the case of some of our feelings it is not always possible to ascribe an objective side to them
a feeling of ennui of impending evil or of bounding vivacity may be produced by an unanalyzable complex of causes
but interest while it is related primarily to the activities of the self is carried over from the activity to the object which occasions the activity
that is interest has both an objective and a subjective side
on the subjective side a certain activity connected with is worth so much on the objective side a certain object is worth so much as related to this
thus we say i have an interest in books or in business my daily activities my are governed with reference to these objects
interest many of our milder feelings terminate within ourselves never attaining sufficient force as motives to impel us to action
whatever it seizes upon becomes an object for some activity for some form of expression of the self
are we interested in a new book we must read it in a new invention we must see it handle it test it in some vocation or avocation we must pursue it
it gives its possessor no opportunity for lethargic rest and quiet but constantly urges him to action
grown ardent interest becomes enthusiasm without which says emerson nothing great was ever accomplished
are we an edison with a strong interest centered in mechanical invention it will drive us day and night in a ceaseless activity which scarcely gives us time for food and sleep
are we a lincoln with an undying interest in the union this motive will make possible superhuman efforts for the accomplishment of our end
are we man or woman anywhere in any walk of life so we are dominated by mighty interests grown into enthusiasm for some object we shall find great purposes growing within us and our life will be one of activity and achievement
on the contrary a life which has developed no great interest lacks motive power
of necessity such a life must be devoid of purpose and hence barren of results counting little while it is being lived and little missed by the world when it is gone
habit antagonistic to while as we have seen interest is necessary to the formation of habits yet habits once formed are antagonistic to interest
that is acts which are so habitually performed that they do themselves are accompanied by a minimum of interest
they come to be done without attentive consciousness hence interest can not attach to their performance
many of the activities which make up the daily round of our lives are of this kind
as long as habit is being modified in some degree as long as we are improving in our ways of doing things interest will still cling to the process but let us once settle into an unmodified rut and interest quickly fades away
we then have the conditions present which make of us either a machine or a drudge
direct and indirect interest we may have an interest either  in the doing of an act or  in the end sought through the doing
in the first instance we call the interest or in the second instance or
interest in the end versus interest in the if we do not find an interest in the doing of our work or if it has become positively disagreeable so that we loathe its performance then there must be some ultimate end for which the task is being performed and in which there is a strong interest else the whole process will be the veriest drudgery
if the end is sufficiently interesting it may serve to throw a halo of interest over the whole process connected with it
the following instance illustrates this fact a boy was told by his father that if he would make the body of an automobile at his bench in the manual training school the father would purchase the running gear for it and give the machine to the boy
in order to secure the coveted prize the boy had to master the arithmetic necessary for making the calculations and the drawing necessary for making the plans to scale before the teacher in manual training would allow him to take up the work of construction
the boy had always lacked interest in both arithmetic and drawing and consequently was dull in them
under the new incentive however he took hold of them with such avidity that he soon surpassed all the remainder of the class and was able to make his calculations and drawings within a term
he secured his automobile a few months later and still retained his interest in arithmetic and drawing
indirect interest as a interest of the indirect type which does not attach to the process but comes from some more or less distant end most of us find much less potent than interest which is immediate
this is especially true unless the end be one of intense desire and not too distant
the assurance to a boy that he must get his lessons well because he will need to be an educated man ten years hence when he goes into business for himself does not compensate for the lack of interest in the lessons of today
yet it is necessary in the economy of life that both children and adults should learn to work under the incitement of indirect interests
much of the work we do is for an end which is more desirable than the work itself
it will always be necessary to sacrifice present pleasure for future good
ability to work cheerfully for a somewhat distant end saves much of our work from becoming drudgery
if interest is removed from both the process and the end no inducement is left to work except compulsion and this if continued results in the lowest type of effort
it puts a man on a level with the beast of burden which constantly shirks its work
indirect interest alone interest coming from an end instead of inhering in the process may finally lead to an interest in the work itself but if it does not the worker is in danger of being left a drudge at last
to be more than a slave to his work one must ultimately find the work worth doing for its own sake
the man who performs his work solely because he has a wife and babies at home will never be an artist in his trade or profession the student who masters a subject only because he must know it for an examination is not developing the traits of a scholar
the question of interest in the process makes the difference between the one who works because he loves to work and the one who toils because he must it makes the difference between the artist and the drudge
the drudge does only what he must when he works the artist all he can
the drudge longs for the end of labor the artist for it to begin
the drudge studies how he may escape his labor the artist how he may better his and ennoble it
to labor when there is joy in the work is elevating to labor under the lash of compulsion is degrading
it matters not so much what a man occupation as how it is performed
a coachman driving his team down the crowded street better than anyone else could do it and glorying in that fact may be a true artist in his occupation and be ennobled through his work
a statesman molding the affairs of a nation as no one else could do it or a scholar leading the thought of his generation is subject to the same law in order to give the best grade of service of which he is capable man must find a joy in the performance of the work as well as in the end sought through its performance
no matter how high the position or how refined the work the worker becomes a slave to his labor unless interest in its performance saves him
transitoriness of certain interests since our interests are always connected with our activities it follows that many interests will have their birth grow to full strength and then fade away as the corresponding instincts which are responsible for the activities pass through these same stages
this only means that interest in play develops at the time when the play activities are seeking expression that interest in the opposite sex becomes strong when instinctive tendencies are directing the attention to the choice of a mate and that interest in abstract studies comes when the development of the brain enables us to carry on logical trains of thought
all of us can recall many interests which were once strong and are now weak or else have altogether passed away
excursions to the little fishing pond securing the colored chromo at school the care of pets reading stories or sentimental ones interest in these things belongs to our past or has left but a faint shadow
other interests have come and these in turn will also disappear and other new ones yet appear as long as we keep on acquiring new experience
interests must be utilized when they this means that we must take advantage of interests when they appear if we wish to utilize and develop them
how many people there are who at one time felt an interest impelling them to cultivate their taste for music art or literature and said they would do this at some convenient season and finally found themselves without a taste for these things
how many of us have felt an interest in some benevolent work but at last discovered that our inclination had died before we found time to help the cause
how many of us young as we are do not at this moment lament the passing of some interest from our lives or are now watching the dying of some interest which we had fondly supposed was as stable as gibraltar
the drawings of every interest which appeals to us is a voice crying now is the appointed time
what impulse urges us today to become or to do we must begin at once to be or perform if we would attain to the coveted end
the value of a strong nor are we to look upon these transitory interests as useless
they come to us not only as a race heritage but they impel us to activities which are immediately useful or else prepare us for the later battles of life
but even aside from this important fact it is worth everything just to be interested
for it is only through the impulsion of interest that we first learn to put forth effort in any true sense of the word and interest furnishes the final foundation upon which volition rests
without interest the greatest powers may slumber in us unawakened and abilities capable of the highest attainment rest satisfied with commonplace mediocrity
no one will ever know how many gladstones and leibnitzes the world has lost simply because their interests were never appealed to in such a way as to start them on the road to achievement
it matters less what the interest be so it be not bad than that there shall be some great interest to compel endeavor test the strength of endurance and lead to habits of achievement
selection among our interests i said early in the discussion that interest is selective among our activities picking out those which appear to be of the most value to us
in the same manner there must be a selection among our interests themselves
the mistake of following too many it is possible for us to become interested in so many lines of activity that we do none of them well
this leads to a life so full of hurry and stress that we forget life in our busy living
says james with respect to the necessity of making a choice among our interests with most objects of desire physical nature restricts our choice to but one of many represented goods and even so it is here
i am often confronted by the necessity of standing by one of my empirical selves and relinquishing the rest
not that i would not if i could be both handsome and fat and well dressed and a great athlete and make a million a year be a wit a bon vivant and a as well as a philosopher a philanthropist statesman warrior and african explorer as well as a poet ' and saint
but the thing is simply impossible
the millionaire work would run counter to the saint the bon vivant and the philosopher and the could not well keep house in the same tenement of clay
such different characters may conceivably at the outset of life be alike possible to man
but to make any one of them actual the rest must more or less be suppressed
the seeker of his truest strongest deepest self must review the list carefully and pick out the one on which to stake his salvation
interests may be too on the other hand it is just as possible for our interests to be too narrow as too broad
the one who has cultivated no interests outside of his daily round of humdrum activities does not get enough out of life
it is possible to become so engrossed with making a living that we forget to live to become so habituated to some narrow treadmill of labor with the limited field of thought suggested by its environment that we miss the richest experiences of life
many there are who live a barren trivial and life because they fail to see the significant and the beautiful which lie just beyond where their interests reach
many there are so taken up with their own petty troubles that they have no heart or sympathy for fellow humanity
many there are so absorbed with their own little achievements that they fail to catch step with the progress of the age
specialization should not come too it is not well to specialize too early in our interests
we miss too many rich fields which lie ready for the harvesting and whose gleaning would enrich our lives
the student who is so buried in books that he has no time for athletic recreations or social diversions is making a mistake equally with the one who is so enthusiastic an athlete and social devotee that he neglects his studies
likewise the youth who is so taken up with the study of one particular line that he applies himself to this at the expense of all other lines is inviting a distorted growth
youth is the time for pushing the sky line back on all sides it is the time for cultivating diverse and varied lines of interests if we would grow into a rich experience in our later lives
the physical must be developed but not at the expense of the mental and vice versa
the social must not be neglected but it must not be indulged to such an extent that other interests suffer
interest in amusements and recreations should be cultivated but these should never run counter to the moral and religious
specialization is necessary but specialization in our interests should rest upon a broad field of fundamental interests in order that the selection of the special line may be an intelligent one and that our specialty shall not prove a rut in which we become so deeply buried that we are lost to the best in life
a proper balance to be it behooves us then to find a proper balance in cultivating our interests making them neither too broad nor too narrow
we should deliberately seek to discover those which are strong enough to point the way to a life vocation but this should not be done until we have had an opportunity to become acquainted with various lines of interests
otherwise our decision in this important matter may be based merely on a whim
we should also decide what interests we should cultivate for our own personal development and happiness and for the service we are to render in a sphere outside our immediate vocation
we should consider avocations as well as vocations
whatever interests are selected should be carried to efficiency
better a reasonable number of carefully selected interests well developed and resulting in efficiency than a multitude of interests which lead us into so many fields that we can at best get but a smattering of each and that by neglecting the things which should mean the most to us
our interests should lead us to live what wagner calls a simple life but not a narrow one
some educators have feared that in finding our occupations interesting we shall lose all power of effort and that the will not being called sufficiently into requisition must suffer from that we shall come to do the interesting and agreeable things well enough but fail before the disagreeable
interest not antagonistic to the best development of the will does not come through our being forced to do acts in which there is absolutely no interest
work done under compulsion never secures the full self in its performance
it is done mechanically and usually under such a spirit of rebellion on the part of the doer that the advantage of such training may well be doubted
nor are we safe in assuming that tasks done without interest as the motive are always performed under the direction of the will
it is far more likely that they are done under some external compulsion and that the will has after all but very little to do with it
a boy may get an uninteresting lesson at school without much pressure from his will providing he is sufficiently afraid of the master
in order that the will may receive training through compelling the performance of certain acts it must have a reasonably free field with external pressure removed
the compelling force must come from within and not from without
on the other hand there is not the least danger that we shall ever find a place in life where all the disagreeable is removed and all phases of our work made smooth and interesting
the necessity will always be rising to call upon effort to take up the fight and hold us to duty where interest has failed
and it is just here that there must be no failure else we shall be mere creatures of circumstance drifting with every eddy in the tide of our life and never able to breast the current
interest is not to supplant the necessity for stern and strenuous endeavor but rather to call forth the largest measure of endeavor of which the self is capable
it is to put at work a larger amount of power than can be secured in any other way in place of supplanting the will it is to give it its point of departure and render its service all the more effective
interest and finally we are not to forget that bad interests have the same propulsive power as good ones and will lead to acts just as surely
and these acts will just as readily be formed into habits
it is worth noticing that back of the act lies an interest in the act lies the seed of a habit ahead of the act lies behavior which grows into conduct this into character and character into destiny
bad interests should be shunned and discouraged
good interests must be installed in the place of the bad ones from which we wish to escape for it is through substitution rather than suppression that we are able to break from the bad and adhere to the good
out of the simple interests of the child grow the more complex interests of the man
lacking the opportunity to develop the interests of childhood the man will come somewhat short of the full interests of manhood
the great thing then in educating a child is to discover the fundamental interests which come to him from the race and using these as a starting point direct them into constantly broadening and more serviceable ones
out of the early interest in play is to come the later interest in work out of the early interest in collecting treasure boxes full of worthless trinkets and old scraps comes the later interest in earning and retaining ownership of property out of the interest in chums and playmates come the larger social interests out of interest in nature comes the interest of the naturalist
and so one by one we may examine the interests which bear the largest fruit in our adult life and we find that they all have their roots in some early interest of childhood which was encouraged and given a chance to grow
order of development of our interests
the order in which our interests develop thus becomes an important question in our education
nor is the order an arbitrary one as might appear on first thought for interest follows the invariable law of attaching to the activity for which the organism is at that time ready and which it then needs in its further growth
that we are sometimes interested in harmful things does not disprove this assertion
the interest in its fundamental aspect is good and but needs more healthful environment or more wise direction
while space forbids a full discussion of the genetic phase of interest here yet we may profit by a brief statement of the fundamental interests of certain periods in our development
the interests of early the interests of early childhood are chiefly connected with ministering to the wants of the organism as expressed in the appetites and in securing control of the larger muscles
activity is the pre√´minent thing racing and romping are worth doing for their own sake alone
imitation is strong curiosity is rising and imagination is building a new world
speech is a joy language is learned with ease and rhyme and rhythm become second nature
the interests of this stage are still very direct and immediate
the thing must be worth doing for the sake of the doing
since the young child life is so full of action and since it is out of acts that habits grow it is doubly desirous during this period that environment models and teaching should all direct his interests and activities into lines that will lead to permanent values
the interests of later in the period from second dentition to puberty there is a great widening in the scope of interests as well as a noticeable change in their character
activity is still the keynote but the child is no longer interested merely in the doing but is now able to look forward to the end sought
interests which are somewhat indirect now appeal to him and the how of things attracts his attention
he is beginning to reach outside of his own little circle and is ready for handicraft reading history and science
spelling writing and arithmetic interest him partly from the activities involved but more as a means to an end
interest in complex games and plays increases but the child is not yet ready for games which require team work
he has not come to the point where he is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of all
interest in moral questions is beginning and right and wrong are no longer things which may or may not be done without rebuke or punishment
the great problem at this stage is to direct the interest into ways of adapting the means to ends and into willingness to work under voluntary attention for the accomplishment of the desired end
the interests of finally with the advent of puberty comes the last stage in the development of interests before adult life
this period is not marked by the birth of new interests so much as by a deepening and broadening of those already begun
the end sought becomes an increasingly larger factor whether in play or in work
mere activity itself no longer satisfies
the youth can now play team games for his social interests are taking shape and he can subordinate himself for the good of the group
interest in the opposite sex takes on a new phase and social form and mode of dress receive attention
a new consciousness of self emerges and the youth becomes introspective
questions of the ultimate meaning of things press for solution and what and who am i demands an answer
at this age we pass from a r√©gime of obedience to one of from an ethics of authority to one of individualism
all the interests are now taking on a more definite and stable form and are looking seriously toward life vocations
this is a time of big plans and strenuous activity
it is a crucial period in our life fraught with pitfalls and dangers with privileges and opportunities
at this strategic point in our life voyage we may anchor ourselves with right interests to a safe manhood and a successful career or we may with wrong interests bind ourselves to a broken life of discouragement and defeat
try making a list of your most important interests in order of their strength
suppose you had made such a list five years ago where would it have differed from the present list
are you ever obliged to perform any activities in which you have little or no interest either directly or indirectly
can you name any activities in which you once had a strong interest but which you now perform chiefly from force of habit and without much interest
have you any interests of which you are not proud
on the other hand do you lack certain interests which you feel that you should possess
what interests are you now trying especially to cultivate
have you as broad a field of interests as you can well take care of
have you so many interests that you are slighting the development of some of the more important ones
observe several recitations for differences in the amount of interest shown
have you ever observed an enthusiastic teacher with an uninterested class
a dull listless teacher with an interested class
a father offers his son a dollar for every grade on his term report which is above ninety what type of interest relative to studies does this appeal to
what do you think of the advisability of giving prizes in connection with school work
most children in the elementary school are not interested in technical grammar why not
histories made up chiefly of dates and lists of kings or presidents are not interesting what is the remedy
would you call any teaching of literature history geography or science successful which fails to develop an interest in the subject
after careful observation make a statement of the differences in the typical play interests of boys and girls of children of the third grade and the eighth grade
the will the fundamental fact in all ranges of life from the lowest to the highest is
every individual either animal or man is constantly meeting situations which demand response
in the lower forms of life this response is very simple while in the higher forms and especially in man it is very complex
the bird sees a nook favorable for a nest and at once appropriates it a man sees a house that strikes his fancy and works and plans and saves for months to secure money with which to buy it
it is evident that the larger the possible number of responses and the greater their diversity and complexity the more difficult it will be to select and compel the right response to any given situation
man therefore needs some special power of control over his acts he requires a
the nature of the will there has been much discussion and not a little controversy as to the true nature of the will
just what the will and what is the content of our mental stream when we are in the act of willing
is there at such times a new and distinctly different content which we do not find in our processes of knowledge or emotion such as perception memory judgment interest desire
or do we find when we are engaged in an act of the will that the mental stream contains only the familiar old elements of attention perception judgment desire purpose organized or set for the purpose of accomplishing or preventing some
the content of the we shall not attempt here to settle the controversy suggested by the foregoing questions nor for immediately practical purposes do we need to settle it
it is perhaps safe to say however that whenever we are willing the mental content consists of elements of cognition and feeling a distinct sense of with which everyone is familiar
whether this sense of effort is a new and different element or only a complex of old and familiar mental processes we need not now decide
the function of the concerning the function of the will there can be no haziness or doubt
volition concerns itself wholly with acts
the will always has to do with causing or inhibiting some action either physical or mental
we need to go to the dentist tell some friend we were in the wrong hold our mind to a difficult or uninteresting task or do some other disagreeable thing from which we shirk
it is at such points that we must call upon the will
again we must restrain our tongue from speaking the unkind word keep from crying out when the dentist drills the tooth check some unworthy line of thought
we must here also appeal to the will
we may conclude then that the will is needed whenever the physical or mental activity must be controlled
some writers have called the work of the will in compelling action its function and in inhibiting action its function
how the will exerts its how does the will bring its compulsion to bear
it is not a kind of mental policeman who can take us by the collar so to speak and say or not do
the secret of the will power of control lies in
it is the line of action that we hold the mind upon with an attitude of intending to perform it that we finally follow
it is the thing we keep thinking about that we finally do
on the other hand let us resolutely hold the mind away from some attractive but unsuitable line of action directing our thoughts to an opposite course or to some wholly different subject and we have effectually blocked the wrong response
to control our acts is therefore to control our thoughts and strength of will can be measured by our ability to direct our attention
the extent of voluntary control over our acts
a relatively small proportion of our acts or responses are controlled by volition
nature in her wise economy has provided a simpler and easier method than to have all our actions performed or checked with conscious effort classes of acts or movements or acts like other phenomena do not just happen
they never occur without a cause back of them
whether they are performed with a conscious end in view or without it the fact remains the same something must lie back of the act to account for its performance
during the last hour each of us has performed many simple movements and more or less complex acts
these acts have varied greatly in character
of many we were wholly unconscious
others were consciously performed but without feeling of effort on our part
still others were accomplished only with effort and after a struggle to decide which of two lines of action we should take
some of our acts were reflex some were chiefly instinctive and some were volitional
simple reflex first there are going on within every living organism countless movements of which he is in large part unconscious which he does nothing to initiate and which he is largely powerless to prevent
some of them are wholly and others almost out of the reach and power of his will
such are the movements of the heart and vascular system the action of the lungs in breathing the movements of the digestive tract the work of the various glands in their process of secretion
the entire organism is a mass of living matter and just because it is living no part of it is at rest
movements of this type require no external stimulus and no direction they are they take care of themselves as long as the body is in health without let or hindrance continuing whether we sleep or wake even if we are in hypnotic or an√¶sthetic coma
with movements of reflex type we shall have no more concern since they are almost wholly physiological and come scarcely at all within the range of the consciousness
instinctive next there are a large number of such acts as closing the eyes when they are threatened starting back from danger crying out from pain or alarm frowning and striking when angry
these may roughly be classed as instinctive and have already been discussed under that head
they differ from the former class in that they require some stimulus to set the act off
we are fully conscious of their performance although they are performed without a conscious end in view
winking the eyes serves an important purpose but that is not why we wink starting back from danger is a wise thing to do but we do not stop to consider this before performing the act
and so it is with a multitude of reflex and instinctive acts
they are performed immediately upon receiving an appropriate stimulus because we possess an organism calculated to act in a definite way in response to certain stimuli
there is no need for and indeed no place for anything to come in between the stimulus and the act
the stimulus pulls the trigger of the nervous system and the act follows at once
acts of these reflex and instinctive types do not come properly within the range of volition hence we will not consider them further
automatic or spontaneous growing out of these reflex and instinctive acts is a broad field of action which may be called or
the distinguishing feature of this type of action is that all such acts though performed now largely without conscious purpose or intent were at one time purposed acts performed with effort this is to say that they were volitional
such acts as writing or fingering the keyboard of a piano were once consciously purposed volitional acts selected from many random or reflex movements
the effects of experience and habit are such however that soon the mere presence of pencil and paper or the sight of the keyboard is enough to set one scribbling or playing
stated differently certain objects and situations come to suggest certain characteristic acts or responses so strongly that the action follows immediately on the heels of the percept of the object or the idea of the act
many illustrations of this type of acts will occur to each of us a door starts to blow shut and we spring up and avert the slam
the memory of a neglected engagement comes to us and we have started to our feet on the instant
a dish of nuts stands before us and we find ourselves nibbling without intending to do so
the cycle from volitional to it is of course evident that no such acts though they were at one time in our experience volitional now require effort or definite intention for their performance
the law covering this point may be stated as follows
all volitional acts when repeated tend through the effects of habit to become automatic and thus relieve the will from the necessity of directing them
the mirror breaks up the automatic control previously developed and requires one to start out much as the child does at the beginning
to illustrate this law try the following experiment draw on a piece of cardboard a star like figure  making each line segment two inches
seat yourself at a table with the star before you placing a mirror back of the star so that it can be seen in the mirror
have someone hold a screen a few inches above the table so as to hide the star from your direct view but so that you can see it in the mirror
now reach your hand under the screen and trace with a pencil around the star from left to right not taking your pencil off the paper until you get clear around
keep track of how long it takes to go around and also note the irregular wanderings of your pencil
try this experiment five times over noting the decrease in time and effort required and the increase in efficiency as the movements tend to become automatic
volitional while it is obvious that the various types of action already described include a very large proportion of all our acts yet they do not include all
for there are some acts that are neither reflex nor instinctive nor automatic but that have to be performed under the stress of compulsion and effort
we constantly meet situations where the necessity for action or restraint runs counter to our inclinations
we daily are confronted by the necessity of making decisions in which the mind must be compelled by effort to take this direction or that direction
conflicting motives or tendencies create frequent necessity for coercion
it is often necessary to drive our bark counter to the current of our desires or our habits or to enter into conflict with a temptation
volition acts in the making of everyone knows for himself the state of inward unrest which we call indecision
a thought enters the mind which would of itself prompt an act but before the act can occur a contrary idea appears and the act is checked another thought comes favoring the act and is in turn counterbalanced by an opposing one
the impelling and inhibiting ideas we call or for and against the proposed act
while we are balancing the motives against each other we are said to
this process of deliberation must go on if we continue to think about the matter at all until one set of ideas has triumphed over the other and secured the attention
when this has occurred we have and the deliberation is at an end
we have exercised the highest function of the will and made a
sometimes the battle of motives is short the decision being reached as soon as there is time to summon all the reasons on both sides of the question
at other times the conflict may go on at intervals for days or weeks neither set of motives being strong enough to vanquish the other and dictate the decision
when the motives are somewhat evenly balanced we wisely pause in making a decision because when one line of action is taken the other can not be and we hesitate to lose either opportunity
a state of indecision is usually highly unpleasant and no doubt more than one decision has been hastened in our lives simply that we might be done with the unpleasantness attendant on the consideration of two contrary and insistent sets of motives
it is of the highest importance when making a decision of any consequence that we should be fair in considering all the reasons on both sides of the question allowing each its just weight
nor is this as easy as it might appear for as we saw in our study of the emotions our feeling attitude toward any object that occupies the mind is largely responsible for the subjective value we place upon it
it is easy to be so prejudiced toward or against a line of action that the motives bearing upon it can not get fair consideration
to be able to eliminate this personal factor to such an extent that the evidence before us on a question may be considered on its merits is a rare accomplishment
types of a decision may be reached in a variety of ways the most important ones of which may now briefly be described after the general plan suggested by professor james the reasonable one of the simplest types of decision is that in which the preponderance of motives is clearly seen to be on one side or the other and the only rational thing to do is to decide in accordance with the weight of evidence
decisions of this type are called
if we discover ten reasons why we should pursue a certain course of action and only one or two reasons of equal weight why we should not then the decision ought not to be hard to make
the points to watch in this case are a that we have really discovered all the important reasons on both sides of the case and b that our feelings of personal interest or prejudice have not given some of the motives an undue weight in our scale of values
external it is to be doubted whether as many of our decisions are made under immediate stress of volition as we think
we may be hesitating between two sets of motives unable to decide between them when a third factor enters which is not really related to the question at all but which finally dictates the decision nevertheless
for example we are considering the question whether we shall go on an excursion or stay at home and complete a piece of work
the benefits coming from the recreation and the pleasures of the trip are pitted against the expense which must be incurred and the desirability of having the work done on time
at this point while as yet we have been unable to decide a friend comes along and we seek to evade the responsibility of making our own decision by appealing to him you tell me what to do
how few of us have never said in effect if not in words i will do this or that if you will
how few have never taken advantage of a rainy day to stay from church or shirk an undesirable engagement
how few have not allowed important questions to be decided by some trivial or accidental factor not really related to the choice in the least
it does not rest on motives which are vitally related to the case but rather on the accident of external circumstances
the person who habitually makes his decisions in this way lacks power of will
he does not hold himself to the question until he has gathered the evidence before him and then himself direct his attention to the best line of action and so secure its performance
he drifts with the tide he goes with the crowd he shirks responsibility
accidental type subjective a second type of
decision may occur when we are hesitating between two lines of action which are seemingly about equally desirable and no preponderating motive enters the field when no external factor appears and no advising friend comes to the rescue
then with the necessity for deciding thrust upon us we tire of the worry and strain of deliberation and say to ourselves this thing must be settled one way or the other pretty soon i am tired of the whole matter
when we have reached this point we are likely to shut our eyes to the evidence in the case and decide largely upon the whim or mood of the moment
very likely we regret our decision the next instant but without any more cause for the regret than we had for the decision
it is evident that such a decision as this does not rest on valid motives but rather on the accident of subjective conditions
habitual decisions of this type are an evidence of a mental laziness or a mental incompetence which renders the individual incapable of marshaling the facts bearing on a case
he can not hold them before his mind and weigh them against each other until one side outweighs the other and dictates the decision
of course the remedy for this weakness of decision lies in not allowing oneself to be pushed into a decision simply to escape the unpleasantness of a state of indecision or the necessity of searching for further evidence which will make the decision easier
on the other hand it is possible to form a habit of of undue hesitancy in coming to conclusions when the evidence is all before us
this gives us the mental dawdler the person who will spend several minutes in an agony of indecision over whether to carry an umbrella on this particular trip whether to wear black shoes or tan shoes today whether to go calling or to stay at home and write letters this afternoon
such a person is usually in a stew over some inconsequential matter and consumes so much time and energy in fussing over trivial things that he is incapable of handling larger ones
if we are certain that we have all the facts in a given case before us and have given each its due weight so far as our judgment will enable us to do then there is nothing to be gained by delaying the decision
nor is there any occasion to change the decision after it has once been made unless new evidence is discovered bearing on the case
decision under the highest type of decision is that in which effort is the determining factor
the pressure of external circumstances and inward impulse is not enough to overcome a calm and determined
two possible lines of action may lie open before us
every current of our being leads toward the one in addition inclination friends honors all beckon in the same direction
from the other course our very nature shrinks duty alone bids us take this line and promises no rewards except the approval of conscience
here is the crucial point in human experience the supreme test of the individual the last measure of man independence and power
winning at this point man has exercised his highest prerogative that of independent choice failing here he reverts toward the lower forms and is a creature of circumstance no longer the master of his own destiny but blown about by the winds of chance
and it behooves us to win in this battle
we may lose in a contest or a game and yet not fail because we have done our best if we fail in the conflict of motives we have planted a seed of weakness from which we shall at last harvest defeat
jean valjean the galley slave of almost a score of years escapes and lives an honest life
he wins the respect and admiration of friends he is elected mayor of his town and honors are heaped on him
at the height of his prosperity he reads one day that a man has been arrested in another town for the escaped convict jean valjean and is about to be sent to the galleys
now comes the supreme test in jean valjean life
shall he remain the honored respected citizen and let an innocent man suffer in his stead or shall he proclaim himself the criminal and again have the collar riveted on his neck and take his place at the oars
he spends one awful night of conflict in which contending motives make a battle ground of his soul
his conscience yet lives and he goes and gives himself up to the officers
nor could he do otherwise and still remain a
strong and weak wills many persons will admit that their memory or imagination or power of perception is not good but few will confess to a weak will
strength of will is everywhere lauded as a mark of worth and character
how can we tell whether our will is strong or weak
not a will but first of all we need to remember that just as we do not have a memory but a system of memories so we do not possess a will but many different wills
by this i mean that the will must be called upon and tested at every point of contact in experience before we have fully measured its strength
our will may have served us reasonably well so far but we may not yet have met any great number of hard tests because our experience and temptations have been limited
nor must we forget to take into account both the negative and the positive functions of the will
many there are who think of the will chiefly in its negative use as a kind of a check or barrier to save us doing certain things
that this is an important function can not be denied
but the positive is the higher function
there are many men and women who are able to resist evil but able to do little good
they are good enough but not good for much
they lack the power of effort and to hold them up to the high standards and stern endeavor necessary to save them from inferiority or mediocrity
it is almost certain that for most who read these words the greatest test of their will power will be in the positive instead of the negative direction
a false measure of will the actual amount of volition exercised in making a decision can not be measured by objective results
the fact that you follow the pathway of duty while i falter and finally drift into the byways of pleasure is not certain evidence that you have put forth the greater power of will
in the first place the allurements which led me astray may have had no charms for you
furthermore you may have so formed the habit of pursuing the pathway of duty when the two paths opened before you that your feet unerringly led you into the narrow way without a struggle
of course you are on safer ground than i and on ground that we should all seek to attain
but nevertheless i although i fell when i should have stood may have been fighting a battle and manifesting a power of resistance of which you under similar temptation would have been incapable
the only point from which a conflict of motives can be safely judged is that of the soul which is engaged in the struggle
several fairly volitional types may be discovered
it is of course to be understood that these types all grade by insensible degrees into each other and that extreme types are the exception rather than the rule
the impulsive the type of will goes along with a nervous organism of the kind
the brain is in a state of highly unstable equilibrium and a relatively slight current serves to set off the motor centers
action follows before there is time for a counteracting current to intervene
putting it in mental terms we act on an idea which presents itself before an opposing one has opportunity to enter the mind
hence action is largely or wholly and but slightly or not at all
it is this type of will which results in the hasty word or deed or the rash act committed on the impulse of the moment and repented of at leisure which compels the frequent i did think or i would not have done it
the impulsive person may undoubtedly have credited up to him many kind words and noble deeds
in addition he usually carries with him an air of spontaneity and which goes far to atone for his faults
the fact remains however that he is too little the master of his acts that he is guided too largely by external circumstances or inward caprice
impulsive action is not to be confused with quick decision and rapid action
many of the world greatest and safest leaders have been noted for quickness of decision and for rapidity of action in carrying out their decisions
it must be remembered however that these men were making decisions in fields well known to them
they were specialists in this line of deliberation
the motives for and against certain lines of action had often been dwelt upon
all possible contingencies had been imaged many times over and a valuation placed upon the different decisions
the various concepts had long been associated with certain definite lines of action
deliberation under such conditions can be carried on with lightning rapidity each motive being checked off as worth so much the instant it presents itself and action can follow immediately when attention settles on the proper motive to govern the decision
this is not impulse but abbreviated deliberation
these facts suggest to us that we should think much and carefully over matters in which we are required to make quick decisions
of course the remedy for the type is to cultivate deliberative action
when the impulse comes to act without consideration pause to give the other side of the question an opportunity to be heard
check the motor response to ideas that suggest action until you have reviewed the field to see whether there are contrary reasons to be taken into account
form the habit of waiting for all evidence before deciding
the obstructed the opposite of the impulsive type of will is the or will
in this type there is too much inhibition or else not enough impulsion
images which should result in action are checkmated by opposing images or do not possess vitality enough as motives to overcome the dead weight of inertia which clogs mental action
the person knows well enough what he should do but he can not get started
he can not get the consent of his will
it may be the student whose mind is tormented by thoughts of coming failure in recitation or examination but who yet can not force himself to the exertion necessary safely to meet the ordeal
it may be the dissolute man who tortures himself in his sober moments with remorse and the thought that he was intended for better things but who waking from his meditations goes on in the same old way
it may be the child undergoing punishment who is to be released from bondage as soon as he will promise to be good but who can not bring himself to say the necessary words
it not only may be but is man or woman anywhere who has ideals which are known to be worthy and noble but which fail to take hold
it is anyone who is following a course of action which he knows is beneath him
no one can doubt that the moral tragedies the failures and the shipwrecks in life come far more from the breaking of the bonds which should bind right ideals to action than from a failure to perceive the truth
men differ far more in their deeds than in their standards of action
the remedy for this diseased type of will is much easier to prescribe than to apply
it is simply to refuse to attend to the contrary thoughts which are blocking action and to cultivate and encourage those which lead to action of the right kind
it is seeking to vitalize our good impulses and render them effective by acting on them whenever opportunity offers
nothing can be accomplished by moodily dwelling on the disgrace of harboring the obstructing ideas
thus brooding over them only encourages them
what we need is to get entirely away from the line of thought in which we have met our obstruction and approach the matter from a different direction
the child who is in a fit of sulks does not so much need a lecture on the disagreeable habit he is forming as to have his thoughts led into lines not connected with the grievance which is causing him the trouble
the stubborn child does not need to have his will broken but rather to have it strengthened
he may be compelled to do what he does not want to do but if this is accomplished through physical force instead of by leading to thoughts connected with the performance of the act it may be doubted whether the will has in any degree been strengthened
indeed it may rather be depended upon that the will has been weakened for an opportunity for through which alone the will develops has been lost
the ultimate remedy for rebellion often lies in greater freedom at the proper time
this does not mean that the child should not obey rightful authority promptly and explicitly but that just as little external authority as possible should intervene to take from the child the opportunity for
the normal the golden mean between these two abnormal types of will may be called the or will
here there is a proper ratio between impulsion and inhibition
ideas are not acted upon the instant they enter the mind without giving time for a survey of the field of motives neither is action sicklied with the pale cast of thought to such an extent that it becomes impossible
the evidence is all considered and each motive fully weighed
but this once done decision follows
no dilatory and obstructive tactics are allowed
the fleeting impulse is not enough to persuade to action neither is action unduly delayed after the decision is made
the will is to be trained as we train the other powers of the mind through the exercise of its normal function
the function of the will is to direct or control in the actual affairs of life
many persons speak of training the will as if we could separate it from the interests and purposes of our daily living and in some way put it through its paces merely for the sake of adding to its general strength
there is as we have seen no such thing as power of will
will is always required in specific acts and emergencies and it is precisely upon such matters that it must be exercised if it is to be cultivated
will to be trained in common round of what is needed in developing the will is a deep moral interest in whatever we set out to do and a high purpose to do it up to the limit of our powers
without this any artificial exercises no matter how carefully they are devised or how heroically they are carried out can not but fail to fit us for the real tests of life with it artificial exercises are superfluous
it matters not so much what our vocation as how it is performed
the most commonplace human experience is rich in opportunities for the highest form of expression possible to the will that of directing us into right lines of action and of holding us to our best in the accomplishment of some dominant purpose
there is no one set form of exercise which alone will serve to train the will
the student pushing steadily toward his goal in spite of poverty and grinding labor the teacher who though unappreciated and poorly paid yet performs every duty with conscientious thoroughness the man who stands firm in the face of temptation the person whom heredity or circumstance has handicapped but who nevertheless courageously fights his battle the countless men and women everywhere whose names are not known to fame but who stand in the hard places bearing the heat and the toil with brave unflinching hearts these are the ones who are developing a moral fiber and strength of will which will stand in the day of stress
better a thousand times such training as this in the thick of life real conflicts than any volitional calisthenics or priggish entered into solely for the training of the will
the work of the school offers as good an opportunity for training powers of will as of memory or reasoning
on the side of inhibition there is always the necessity for and control so that the rights of others may not be infringed upon
temptations to unfairness or insincerity in lessons and examinations are always to be met
the social relations of the school necessitate the development of personal poise and independence
on the positive side the opportunities for the exercise of will power are always at hand in the school
every lesson gives the pupil a chance to measure his strength and determination against the resistance of the task
high standards are to be built up ideals maintained habits rendered secure
the great problem for the teacher in this connection is so to organize both control and instruction that the largest possible opportunity is given to pupils for the exercise of their own powers of will in all school relations
freedom of the will or the extent of its control we have seen in this discussion that will is a mode of control control of our thoughts and through our thoughts of our actions
will may be looked upon then as the culmination of the mental life the highest form of directive agent within us
beginning with the direction of the simplest movements it goes on until it governs the current of our life in the pursuit of some distant ideal
limitations of the just how far the will can go in its control just how far man is a free moral agent has long been one of the mooted questions among the philosophers
if the will can exercise full control over all our acts it by this very fact determines our character and character spells destiny
there is not the least doubt however that the will in thus directing us in the achievement of a destiny works under two limitations
every individual enters upon life with a large stock of which go far to shape his interests and aspirations
and these are important factors in the work of volition
we all have our setting in the midst of a great and social which is largely beyond our power to modify and whose influences are constantly playing upon us and molding us according to their type
these limitations the conditions of yet there is nothing in this thought to discourage us
for these very limitations have in them our hope of a larger freedom
man heredity coming to him through ages of conflict with the forces of nature with his brother man and with himself has deeply instilled in him the spirit of independence and
it has trained him to deliberate to choose to achieve
it has developed in him the power
likewise man environment in which he must live and work furnishes the problems which his life work is to solve and of whose solution will receives its only true
it is through the action and interaction of these two factors then that man is to work out his destiny
what he coupled with what he may leads him to what he may
every man possesses in some degree a spark of divinity a sovereign individuality a power of independent initiative
this is all he needs to make him free free to do his best in whatever walk of life he finds himself
if he will but do this the doing of it will lead him into a constantly growing freedom and he can voice the cry of every earnest heart build thee more stately mansions o my soul
as the swift seasons roll leave thy past
let each new temple nobler than the last shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast
till thou at length art free leaving thine outgrown shell by life unresting sea
give illustrations from your own experience of the various types of action mentioned in this discussion
from your own experience of the last hour what examples of impulsive action can you give
would it have been better in some cases had you stopped to deliberate
are you easily influenced by prejudice or personal preference in making decisions
what recent decisions have been thus affected
can you classify the various ones of your decisions which you can recall under the four types mentioned in the text
under which class does the largest number fall
have you a tendency to drift with the crowd
are you independent in deciding upon and following out a line of action
ought advice to do more than to assist in getting all the evidence on a case before the one who is to decide
can you judge yourself well enough to tell to which volitional type you belong
what is the difference between stubbornness and firmness
suppose you ask your instructor or a friend to assist you in classifying yourself as to volitional type
are you troubled with indecision that is do you have hard work to decide in trivial matters even after you know all the facts in the case
what is the cause of these states of indecision
have you a strong power of will
do you submit easily to temptation
can you hold yourself up to a high degree of effort
have you ever failed in the attainment of some cherished ideal because you could not bring yourself to pay the price in the sacrifice or effort necessary
consider the class work and examinations of schools that you know
does the system of management and control throw responsibility on the pupils in a way to develop their powers of will
what motives or incentives can be used to encourage pupils to use to maintain high standards of excellence in their studies and conduct
does it pay to be heroic in one
we have already seen that the mind and the body are associated in a copartnership in which each is an indispensable and active member
we have seen that the body gets its dignity and worth from its relation with the mind and that the mind is dependent on the body for the crude material of its thought and also for the carrying out of its mandates in securing adaptation to our environment
we have seen as a corollary of these facts that the efficiency of both mind and body is conditioned by the manner in which each carries out its share of the mutual activities
let us see something more of this interrelation
no impression without corresponding has become a maxim in both physiology and psychology
inner life implies in external activities
the stream of impressions pouring in upon us hourly from our environment must have means of expression if development is to follow
we can not be passive recipients but must be active participants in the educational process
we must not only be able to and but to
the many sources of the nature of the impressions which come to us and how they all lead on toward ultimate expression is shown in the accompanying diagram fig
our material environment is thrusting impressions upon us every moment of our life also the material objects with which we deal have become so saturated with social values that each comes to us with a double significance and what an object often stands for more than what it
from the lives of people with whom we daily mingle from the wider circle whose lives do not immediately touch ours but who are interpreted to us by the press by history and literature from the social institutions into which have gone the lives of millions and of which our lives form a part there come to us constantly a flood of impressions whose influence can not be measured
so likewise with religious impressions
god is all about us and within us
he speaks to us from every nook and corner of nature and communes with us through the still small voice from within if we will but listen
the bible religious instruction and the lives of good people are other sources of religious impressions constantly tending to mold our lives
the beautiful in nature art and human conduct constantly appeals to us in √¶ssthetic impressions
all impressions lead toward each of these groups of impressions may be subdivided and extended into an almost indefinite number and variety the different groups meeting and overlapping it is true yet each preserving reasonably distinct characteristics
a common characteristic of them all as shown in the diagram is that they all point toward expression
the varieties of light color form and distance which we get through vision are not merely that we may know these phenomena of nature but that knowing them we may use the knowledge in making proper responses to our environment
our power to know human sympathy and love through our social impressions are not merely that we may feel these emotions but that feeling them we may act in response to them
it is impossible to classify logically in any simple scheme all the possible forms of expression
the diagram will serve however to call attention to some of the chief modes of bodily expression and also to the results of the bodily expressions in the arts and vocations
here again the process of subdivision and extension can be carried out indefinitely
the laugh can be made to tell many different stories
crying may express bitter sorrow or uncontrollable joy
vocal speech may be carried on in a thousand tongues
dramatic action may be made to portray the whole range of human feelings
plays and games are wide enough in their scope to satisfy the demands of all ages and every people
the handicrafts cover so wide a range that the material progress of civilization can be classed under them and indeed without their development the arts and vocations would be impossible
architecture sculpture painting music and literature have a thousand possibilities both in technique and content
likewise the modes of society conduct and religion are unlimited in their forms of expression
limitations of while it is more blessed to give than to receive it is somewhat harder in the doing for more of the self is after all involved in expression than in impression
expression needs to be cultivated as an art for who can express all he thinks or feels or conceives
who can do his innermost self justice when he attempts to express it in language in music or in marble
the painter answers when praised for his work if you could but see the picture i intended to paint
the pupil says i know but i can not tell
the friend says i wish i could tell you how sorry i am
the actor complains if i could only portray the passion as i feel it i could bring all the world to my feet
the body being of grosser structure than the mind must always lag somewhat behind in expressing the mind states yet so perfect is the harmony between the two that with a body well trained to respond to the mind needs comparatively little of the spiritual need be lost in its expression through the material
the place of expression in development
nor are we to think that cultivation of expression results in better power of expression alone or that lack of cultivation results only in decreased power of expression
intellectual value of there is a distinct mental value in expression
an idea always assumes new clearness and wider relations when it is expressed
michael angelo making his plans for the great cathedral found his first concept of the structure expanding and growing more beautiful as he developed his plans
the sculptor beginning to model the statue after the image which he has in his mind finds the image growing and becoming more expressive and beautiful as the clay is molded and formed
the writer finds the scope and worth of his book growing as he proceeds with the writing
the student beginning doubtfully on his construction in geometry finds the truth growing clearer as he proceeds
the child with a dim and hazy notion of the meaning of the story in history or literature discovers that the meaning grows clear as he himself works out its expression in speech in the handicrafts or in dramatic representation
so we may apply the test to any realm of thought whatever and the law holds good
it is not in its apprehension but in its expression that a truth finally becomes assimilated to our body of usable
and this means that in all training of the body through its motor expression we are to remember that the mind must be behind the act that the intellect must guide the hand that the object is not to make skillful fingers alone but to develop clear and intelligent thought as well
moral value of expression also has a distinct moral value
there are many more people of good intentions than of moral character in the world
the rugged proverb tells us that the road to hell is paved with good intentions
and how easy it is to form good resolutions
who of us has not after some moral struggle said i will break the bonds of this habit i will enter upon that heroic line of action
and then satisfied for the time with having made the resolution continued in the old path until we were surprised later to find that we had never got beyond the resolution
it is not in the moment of the resolve but in the moment when the resolve is carried out in action that the moral value inheres
to take a stand on a question of right and wrong means more than to show one allegiance to the right it clears one own moral vision and gives him command of himself
expression is finally the only true test for our morality
lacking moral expression we may stand in the class of those who are merely good but we can never enter the class of those who are good for something
one can not but wonder what would happen if all the people in the world who are morally right should give expression to their moral sentiments not in words alone but in deeds
surely the millennium would speedily come not only among the nations but in the lives of men
religious value of true religious experience demands expression
the older conception of a religious life was to escape from the world and live a life of communion and contemplation in some secluded spot ignoring the world thirsting without
later religious teaching however recognized the fact that religion can not consist in drinking in blessings alone no matter how ecstatic the feeling which may accompany the process that it is not the receiving but this along with the giving that enriches the life
to give the cup of cold water to visit the widow and the fatherless to comfort and help the needy and forlorn this is not only scriptural but it is psychological
only as religious feeling goes out into religious expression can we have a normal religious experience
social value of the criterion of an education once was how much does he know
the world did not expect an educated man to anything he was to be put on a pedestal and admired from a distance
but this criterion is now obsolete
society cares little how much we know if it does not enable us to do
people no longer admire mere knowledge but insist that the man of education shall put his shoulder to the wheel and lend a hand wherever help is needed
education is no longer to set men apart from their fellows but to make them more efficient comrades and helpers in the world work
not the man who chemistry and botany but he who can use this knowledge to make two blades of grass grow where but one grew before is the true benefactor of his race
in short the world demands services returned for opportunities afforded it expects social expression to result from education
and this is also best for the individual for only through social service can we attain to a full realization of the social values in our environment
only thus can we enter fully into the social heritage of the ages which we receive from books and institutions only thus can we come into the truest and best relations with humanity in a common brotherhood only thus can we live the broader and more significant life and come to realize the largest possible social self
educational use of expression
the educational significance of the truths illustrated in the diagram and the discussion has been somewhat slow in taking hold in our schools
this has been due not alone to the slowness of the educational world to grasp a new idea but also to the practical difficulties connected with adapting the school exercises as well to the expression side of education as to the impression
from the fall of athens on down to the time of froebel the schools were constituted on the theory that pupils were to education that they were to knowledge that their minds were to be with facts
children were to be seen and not heard
education was largely a process of gorging the memory with information
easier to provide for the impression side
it is evident that it is far easier to provide for the passive side of education than for the active side
all that is needed in the former case is to have teachers and books reasonably full of information and pupils sufficiently docile to receive it
but in the latter case the equipment must be more extensive
if the child is to be allowed to carry out his impressions into action if he is actually to something himself then he must be supplied with adequate equipment
so far as the home life was concerned the child of several generations ago was at a decided advantage over the child of today on the expression side of his education
the homes of that day were beehives of industry in which a dozen handicrafts were taught and practiced
the buildings the farm implements and most of the furniture of the home were made from the native timber
the material for the clothing of the family was produced on the farm made into cloth and finally into garments in the home
nearly all the supplies for the table came likewise from the farm
these industries demanded the combined efforts of the family and each child did his or her part
of our people live in cities and towns and even in the village and on the farm the handicrafts of the home have been relegated to the factory and everything comes into the home ready for use
the telephone the mail carrier and the deliveryman do all the errands even and the child in the home is deprived of responsibility and of nearly all opportunity for manual expression
this is no one fault for it is just one phase of a great industrial readjustment in society
yet the fact remains that the home has lost an important element in education which the school must supply if we are not to be the losers educationally by the change
the school to take up the and modern educational method is insisting precisely on this point
a few years ago the boy caught whittling in school was a fit subject for a flogging the boy is today given bench and tools and is instructed in their use
then the child was punished for drawing pictures now we are using drawing as one of the best modes of expression
then instruction in singing was intrusted to an occasional evening class which only the older children could attend and which was taught by some itinerant singing master today we make music one of our most valuable school exercises
then all play time was so much time wasted now we recognize play as a necessary and valuable mode of expression and development
then dramatic representation was confined to the occasional exhibition or evening entertainment now it has become a recognized part of our school work
then it was a crime for pupils to communicate with each other in school now a part of the school work is planned so that pupils work in groups and thus receive social training
then our schoolrooms were destitute of every vestige of beauty today many of them are artistic and beautiful
this statement of the case is rather if applied to our whole school system however
for there are still many schools in which all forms of handicraft are unknown and in which the only training in artistic expression is that which comes from caricaturing the teacher
singing is still an unknown art to many teachers
the play instinct is yet looked upon with suspicion and distrust in some quarters
a large number of our schoolrooms are as barren and ugly today as ever and contain an atmosphere as stifling to all forms of natural expression
we can only comfort ourselves with holmes maxim that it matters not so much where we stand as in what direction we are moving
and we certainly are moving toward a larger development and greater efficiency in expression on the part of those who pass through our schools
expression and finally all that has been said in this discussion has direct reference to what we call character that mysterious something which we so often hear eulogized and so seldom analyzed
character has two distinct phases which may be called the phase and the phase or stating it differently character is both what we
the first of these has to do with the nature of the real innermost self and the last with the modes in which this self finds expression
and it is fair to say that those about us are concerned with what we are chiefly from its relation to what we do
character is not a thing but a process it is the succession of our thoughts and acts from hour to hour
it is not something which we can hoard and protect and polish unto a more perfect day but it is the everyday self in the process of living
and the only way in which it can be made or marred is through the nature of this stream of thoughts and acts which constitute the day life is through or
two lines of the cultivation of character must then ignore neither of these two lines
to neglect the first is to forget that it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks that a corrupt tree can not bring forth good fruit that the act is the true index of the soul
to omit the second is to leave the character half formed the will weak and the life inefficient and barren of results
the mind must be supplied with noble ideas and high ideals with right emotions and worthy ambitions
on the other hand the proper connection must be established between these mental states and appropriate acts
and the acts must finally grow into habits so that we naturally and inevitably translate our ideas and ideals our emotions and ambitions into deeds
our character must be strong not in thought and feeling alone but also in the power to return to the world its finished product in the form of service
do you find that you understand better some difficult point or problem after you have succeeded in stating it
do you remember better what you have expressed
in which particular ones of your studies do you think you could have done better if you had been given more opportunity for expression
explain the psychology of the maxim we learn to do by doing
observe various schools at work for the purpose of determining whether opportunities for expression in the recitations are adequate
have you ever seen a class when listless from listening liven up when they were given something to themselves
make a study of the types of laughter you hear
why is some laughter much more pleasant than other laughter
what did a noted sculptor mean when he said that a smile at the eyes can not be depended upon as can one at the mouth
what examples have you observed in children plays showing their love for dramatic representation
what handicrafts are the most suitable for children of primary grades
do you number those among your acquaintance who seem bright enough so far as learning is concerned but who can not get anything accomplished
is the trouble on the expression side of their character
what are you doing about your own powers of expression
are you seeking to cultivate expression in new lines
is there danger in attempting too many lines

a few words about dostoevsky himself may help the english reader to understand his work
dostoevsky was the son of a doctor
his parents were very and deeply religious people but so poor that they lived with their five children in only two rooms
the father and mother spent their evenings in reading aloud to their children generally from books of a serious character
though always sickly and delicate dostoevsky came out third in the final examination of the petersburg school of engineering
there he had already begun his first work poor folk
this story was published by the poet nekrassov in his review and was received with acclamations
the shy unknown youth found himself instantly something of a celebrity
a brilliant and successful career seemed to open before him but those hopes were soon dashed
though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist dostoevsky was one of a little group of young men who met together to read fourier and proudhon
he was accused of taking part in conversations against the censorship of reading a letter from byelinsky to gogol and of knowing of the intention to set up a printing press
under nicholas i that stern and just man as maurice baring calls him this was enough and he was condemned to death
after eight months imprisonment he was with others taken out to the semyonovsky square to be shot
writing to his brother mihail dostoevsky says they snapped words over our heads and they made us put on the white shirts worn by persons condemned to death
thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes to suffer execution
being the third in the row i concluded i had only a few minutes of life before me
i thought of you and your dear ones and i contrived to kiss plestcheiev and dourov who were next to me and to bid them farewell
suddenly the troops beat a tattoo we were unbound brought back upon the scaffold and informed that his majesty had spared us our lives
the sentence was commuted to hard labour
one of the prisoners grigoryev went mad as soon as he was untied and never regained his sanity
the intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on dostoevsky s mind
though his religious temper led him in the end to accept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing in his own case he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings
he describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the cruelty of inflicting such torture
then followed four years of penal servitude spent in the company of common criminals in siberia where he began the dead house and some years of service in a disciplinary battalion
he had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest and this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy from which he suffered for the rest of his life
the fits occurred three or four times a year and were more frequent in periods of great strain
in  he was allowed to return to russia
he started a journal vremya which was forbidden by the censorship through a misunderstanding
in  he lost his first wife and his brother mihail
he was in terrible poverty yet he took upon himself the payment of his brother s debts
he started another journal the epoch which within a few months was also prohibited
he was weighed down by debt his brother s family was dependent on him he was forced to write at speed and is said never to have corrected his work
the later years of his life were much softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife
in june  he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the monument to pushkin in moscow and he was received with extraordinary demonstrations of love and honour
a few months later dostoevsky died
he was followed to the grave by a vast multitude of mourners who gave the hapless man the funeral of a king
he is still probably the most widely read writer in russia
in the words of a russian critic who seeks to explain the feeling inspired by dostoevsky he was one of ourselves a man of our blood and our bone but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than we have his insight impresses us as wisdom that wisdom of the heart which we seek that we may learn from it how to live
all his other gifts came to him from nature this he won for himself and through it he became great
on an exceptionally hot evening early in july a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in place and walked slowly as though in hesitation towards bridge
he had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase
his garret was under the roof of a high house and was more like a cupboard than a room
the landlady who provided him with garret dinners and attendance lived on the floor below and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen the door of which invariably stood open
and each time he passed the young man had a sick frightened feeling which made him scowl and feel ashamed
he was hopelessly in debt to his landlady and was afraid of meeting her
this was not because he was cowardly and abject quite the contrary but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition verging on hypochondria
he had become so completely absorbed in himself and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting not only his landlady but anyone at all
he was crushed by poverty but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him
he had given up attending to matters of practical importance he had lost all desire to do so
nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him
but to be stopped on the stairs to be forced to listen to her trivial irrelevant gossip to pestering demands for payment threats and complaints and to rack his brains for excuses to prevaricate to lie no rather than that he would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen
this evening however on coming out into the street he became acutely aware of his fears
i want to attempt a thing and am frightened by these trifles he thought with an odd smile
hm yes all is in a man s hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice that s an axiom
it would be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of
taking a new step uttering a new word is what they fear most
it s because i chatter that i do nothing
or perhaps it is that i chatter because i do nothing
i ve learned to chatter this last month lying for days together in my den thinking of jack the
it s simply a fantasy to amuse myself a plaything
the heat in the street was terrible and the airlessness the bustle and the plaster scaffolding bricks and dust all about him and that special petersburg stench so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summer all worked painfully upon the young man s already overwrought nerves
the insufferable stench from the which are particularly numerous in that part of the town and the drunken men whom he met continually although it was a working day completed the revolting misery of the picture
an expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man s refined face
he was by the way exceptionally handsome above the average in height slim with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair
soon he sank into deep thought or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring to observe it
from time to time he would mutter something from the habit of talking to himself to which he had just confessed
at these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak for two days he had scarcely tasted food
he was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags
in that quarter of the town however scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise
owing to the proximity of the hay market the number of establishments of bad character the preponderance of the trading and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the heart of petersburg types so various were to be seen in the streets that no figure however queer would have caused surprise
but there was such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man s heart that in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth he minded his rags least of all in the street
it was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students whom indeed he disliked meeting at any time
and yet when a drunken man who for some unknown reason was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy dray horse suddenly shouted at him as he drove past hey there german hatter bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him the young man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat
it was a tall round hat from zimmerman s but completely worn out rusty with age all torn and bespattered brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly fashion
not shame however but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him
i knew it he muttered in confusion i thought so
why a stupid thing like this the most trivial detail might spoil the whole plan
it looks absurd and that makes it noticeable
with my rags i ought to wear a cap any sort of old pancake but not this grotesque thing
nobody wears such a hat it would be noticed a mile off it would be remembered
what matters is that people would remember it and that would give them a clue
for this business one should be as little conspicuous as possible
trifles trifles are what matter
why it s just such trifles that always ruin everything
he had not far to go he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate of his lodging house exactly seven hundred and thirty
he had counted them once when he had been lost in dreams
at the time he had put no faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous but daring recklessness
now a month later he had begun to look upon them differently and in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at his own impotence and indecision he had involuntarily come to regard this hideous dream as an exploit to be attempted although he still did not realise this himself
he was positively going now for a rehearsal of his project and at every step his excitement grew more and more violent
with a sinking heart and a nervous tremor he went up to a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal and on the other into the street
this house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by working people of all kinds tailors locksmiths cooks germans of sorts girls picking up a living as best they could petty clerks etc
there was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the two courtyards of the house
three or four were employed on the building
the young man was very glad to meet none of them and at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right and up the staircase
it was a back staircase dark and narrow but he was familiar with it already and knew his way and he liked all these surroundings in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded
if i am so scared now what would it be if it somehow came to pass that i were really going to do it
he could not help asking himself as he reached the fourth storey
there his progress was barred by some porters who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat
he knew that the flat had been occupied by a german clerk in the civil service and his family
this german was moving out then and so the fourth floor on this staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman
that s a good thing anyway he thought to himself as he rang the bell of the old woman s flat
the bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of copper
the little flats in such houses always have bells that ring like that
he had forgotten the note of that bell and now its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it clearly before him
he started his nerves were terribly overstrained by now
in a little while the door was opened a tiny crack the old woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack and nothing could be seen but her little eyes glittering in the darkness
but seeing a number of people on the landing she grew bolder and opened the door wide
the young man stepped into the dark entry which was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen
the old woman stood facing him in silence and looking inquiringly at him
she was a diminutive withered up old woman of sixty with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp little nose
her colourless somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared with oil and she wore no kerchief over it
round her thin long neck which looked like a hen s leg was knotted some sort of flannel rag and in spite of the heat there hung flapping on her shoulders a mangy fur cape yellow with age
the old woman coughed and groaned at every instant
the young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar expression for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again
raskolnikov a student i came here a month ago the young man made haste to mutter with a half bow remembering that he ought to be more polite
i remember my good sir i remember quite well your coming here the old woman said distinctly still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face
i am again on the same errand raskolnikov continued a little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman s mistrust
perhaps she is always like that though only i did not notice it the other time he thought with an uneasy feeling
the old woman paused as though hesitating then stepped on one side and pointing to the door of the room she said letting her visitor pass in front of her step in my good sir
the little room into which the young man walked with yellow paper on the walls geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows was brightly lighted up at that moment by the setting sun
so the sun will shine like this too
flashed as it were by chance through raskolnikov s mind and with a rapid glance he scanned everything in the room trying as far as possible to notice and remember its arrangement
but there was nothing special in the room
the furniture all very old and of yellow wood consisted of a sofa with a huge bent wooden back an oval table in front of the sofa a with a fixed on it between the windows chairs along the walls and two or three prints in yellow frames representing german damsels with birds in their hands that was all
in the corner a light was burning before a small ikon
everything was very clean the floor and the furniture were brightly polished everything shone
lizaveta s work thought the young man
there was not a speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat
it s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such cleanliness raskolnikov thought again and he stole a curious glance at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room in which stood the old woman s bed and chest of drawers and into which he had never looked before
these two rooms made up the whole flat
the old woman said severely coming into the room and as before standing in front of him so as to look him straight in the face
i ve brought something to pawn here and he drew out of his pocket an flat silver watch on the back of which was engraved a globe the chain was of steel
but the time is up for your last pledge
the month was up the day before yesterday
i will bring you the interest for another month wait a little
but that s for me to do as i please my good sir to wait or to sell your pledge at once
how much will you give me for the watch alyona ivanovna
you come with such trifles my good sir it s scarcely worth anything
i gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler s for a rouble and a half
give me four roubles for it i shall redeem it it was my father s
i shall be getting some money soon
a rouble and a half and interest in advance if you like
a rouble and a half cried the young man
please yourself and the old woman handed him back the watch
the young man took it and was so angry that he was on the point of going away but checked himself at once remembering that there was nowhere else he could go and that he had had another object also in coming
the old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys and disappeared behind the curtain into the other room
the young man left standing alone in the middle of the room listened inquisitively thinking
he could hear her unlocking the chest of drawers
it must be the top drawer he reflected
so she carries the keys in a pocket on the right
all in one bunch on a steel ring
and there s one key there three times as big as all the others with deep notches that can t be the key of the chest of drawers then there must be some other chest or that s worth knowing
here sir as we say ten copecks the rouble a month so i must take fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance
but for the two roubles i lent you before you owe me now twenty copecks on the same reckoning in advance
so i must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch
only a rouble and fifteen copecks now
the young man did not dispute it and took the money
he looked at the old woman and was in no hurry to get away as though there was still something he wanted to say or to do but he did not himself quite know what
i may be bringing you something else in a day or two alyona ivanovna a valuable thing silver a as soon as i get it back from a friend he broke off in confusion
well we will talk about it then sir
are you always at home alone your sister is not here with you
he asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the passage
what business is she of yours my good sir
oh nothing particular i simply asked
raskolnikov went out in complete confusion
this confusion became more and more intense
as he went down the stairs he even stopped short two or three times as though suddenly struck by some thought
when he was in the street he cried out oh god how loathsome it all is
and how could such an atrocious thing come into my head
what filthy things my heart is capable of
yes filthy above all disgusting loathsome loathsome and for a whole month i ve been
but no words no exclamations could express his agitation
the feeling of intense repulsion which had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he was on his way to the old woman had by now reached such a pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to do with himself to escape from his wretchedness
he walked along the pavement like a drunken man regardless of the and jostling against them and only came to his senses when he was in the next street
looking round he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement
at that instant two drunken men came out at the door and abusing and supporting one another they mounted the steps
without stopping to think raskolnikov went down the steps at once
till that moment he had never been into a tavern but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a burning thirst
he longed for a drink of cold beer and attributed his sudden weakness to the want of food
he sat down at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner ordered some beer and eagerly drank off the first glassful
at once he felt easier and his thoughts became clear
all that s nonsense he said hopefully and there is nothing in it all to worry about
it s simply physical derangement
just a glass of beer a piece of dry bread and in one moment the brain is stronger the mind is clearer and the will is firm
phew how utterly petty it all is
but in spite of this scornful reflection he was by now looking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden and he gazed round in a friendly way at the people in the room
but even at that moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also not normal
there were few people at the time in the tavern
besides the two drunken men he had met on the steps a group consisting of about five men and a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time
their departure left the room quiet and rather empty
the persons still in the tavern were a man who appeared to be an artisan drunk but not extremely so sitting before a pot of beer and his companion a huge stout man with a grey beard in a short coat
he was very drunk and had dropped asleep on the bench every now and then he began as though in his sleep cracking his fingers with his arms wide apart and the upper part of his body bounding about on the bench while he hummed some meaningless refrain trying to recall some such lines as these
his wife a year he fondly loved his wife a a year he fondly loved
or suddenly waking up again walking along the crowded row he met the one he used to know
but no one shared his enjoyment his silent companion looked with positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations
there was another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government clerk
he was sitting apart now and then sipping from his pot and looking round at the company
he too appeared to be in some agitation
chapter ii raskolnikov was not used to crowds and as we said before he avoided society of every sort more especially of late
but now all at once he felt a desire to be with other people
something new seemed to be taking place within him and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company
he was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy excitement that he longed to rest if only for a moment in some other world whatever it might be and in spite of the filthiness of the surroundings he was glad now to stay in the tavern
the master of the establishment was in another room but he frequently came down some steps into the main room his jaunty tarred boots with red tops coming into view each time before the rest of his person
he wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat with no cravat and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an iron lock
at the counter stood a boy of about fourteen and there was another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted
on the counter lay some sliced cucumber some pieces of dried black bread and some fish chopped up small all smelling very bad
it was insufferably close and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such an atmosphere might well make a man drunk
there are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the first moment before a word is spoken
such was the impression made on raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him who looked like a retired clerk
the young man often recalled this impression afterwards and even ascribed it to presentiment
he looked repeatedly at the clerk partly no doubt because the latter was staring persistently at him obviously anxious to enter into conversation
at the other persons in the room including the the clerk looked as though he were used to their company and weary of it showing a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and culture inferior to his own with whom it would be useless for him to converse
he was a man over fifty bald and grizzled of medium height and stoutly built
his face bloated from continual drinking was of a yellow even greenish tinge with swollen eyelids out of which keen reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks
but there was something very strange in him there was a light in his eyes as though of intense feeling perhaps there were even thought and intelligence but at the same time there was a gleam of something like madness
he was wearing an old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat with all its buttons missing except one and that one he had buttoned evidently clinging to this last trace of respectability
a crumpled shirt front covered with spots and stains protruded from his canvas waistcoat
like a clerk he wore no beard nor moustache but had been so long unshaven that his chin looked like a stiff greyish brush
and there was something respectable and like an official about his manner too
but he was restless he ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his hands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky table
at last he looked straight at raskolnikov and said loudly and resolutely may i venture honoured sir to engage you in polite conversation
forasmuch as though your exterior would not command respect my experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not accustomed to drinking
i have always respected education when in conjunction with genuine sentiments and i am besides a titular counsellor in rank
marmeladov such is my name titular counsellor
i make bold to inquire have you been in the service
no i am studying answered the young man somewhat surprised at the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly addressed
in spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for company of any sort on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached or attempted to approach him
a student then or formerly a student cried the clerk
i m a man of experience immense experience sir and he tapped his forehead with his fingers in
you ve been a student or have attended some learned institution
he got up staggered took up his jug and glass and sat down beside the young man facing him a little sideways
he was drunk but spoke fluently and boldly only occasionally losing the thread of his sentences and drawling his words
he pounced upon raskolnikov as greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month
honoured sir he began almost with solemnity poverty is not a vice that s a true saying
yet i know too that drunkenness is not a virtue and that that s even truer
but beggary honoured sir beggary is a vice
in poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul but in beggary never no one
for beggary a man is not chased out of human society with a stick he is swept out with a broom so as to make it as humiliating as possible and quite right too forasmuch as in beggary i am ready to be the first to humiliate myself
honoured sir a month ago lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating and my wife is a very different matter from me
allow me to ask you another question out of simple curiosity have you ever spent a night on a hay barge on the neva
no i have not happened to answered raskolnikov
well i ve just come from one and it s the fifth night i ve slept so
he filled his glass emptied it and paused
bits of hay were in fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair
it seemed quite probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days
his hands particularly were filthy
they were fat and red with black nails
his conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest
the boys at the counter fell to sniggering
the innkeeper came down from the upper room apparently on purpose to listen to the funny fellow and sat down at a little distance yawning lazily but with dignity
evidently marmeladov was a familiar figure here and he had most likely acquired his weakness for speeches from the habit of frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in the tavern
this habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards and especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order at home
hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify themselves and even if possible obtain consideration
funny fellow pronounced the innkeeper
and why don t you work why aren t you at your duty if you are in the service
why am i not at my duty honoured sir marmeladov went on addressing himself exclusively to raskolnikov as though it had been he who put that question to him
does not my heart ache to think what a useless worm i am
a month ago when lebeziatnikov beat my wife with his own hands and i lay drunk didn t i suffer
excuse me young man has it ever happened to you
well to petition hopelessly for a loan
but what do you mean by hopelessly
hopelessly in the fullest sense when you know beforehand that you will get nothing by it
you know for instance beforehand with positive certainty that this man this most reputable and exemplary citizen will on no consideration give you money and indeed i ask you why should he
for he knows of course that i shan t pay it back
but lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself and that that s what is done now in england where there is political economy
why i ask you should he give it to me
and yet though i know beforehand that he won t i set off to him and
why do you go put in raskolnikov
well when one has no one nowhere else one can go
for every man must have somewhere to go
since there are times when one absolutely must go somewhere
when my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket then i had to go for my daughter has a yellow passport he added in parenthesis looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man
he went on hurriedly and with apparent composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the innkeeper smiled no matter i am not confounded by the wagging of their heads for everyone knows everything about it already and all that is secret is made open
and i accept it all not with contempt but with humility
no to put it more strongly and more distinctly not
you looking upon me assert that i am not a pig
the young man did not answer a word
well the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside
well so be it i am a pig but she is a lady
i have the semblance of a beast but katerina ivanovna my spouse is a person of education and an officer s daughter
granted granted i am a scoundrel but she is a woman of a noble heart full of sentiments refined by education
honoured sir honoured sir you know every man ought to have at least one place where people feel for him
but katerina ivanovna though she is magnanimous she is unjust
and yet although i realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity for i repeat without being ashamed she pulls my hair young man he declared with redoubled dignity hearing the sniggering again but my god if she would but once
it s all in vain and it s no use talking
for more than once my wish did come true and more than once she has felt for me but such is my fate and i am a beast by nature
rather assented the innkeeper yawning
marmeladov struck his fist resolutely on the table
do you know sir do you know i have sold her very stockings for drink
not her shoes that would be more or less in the order of things but her stockings her stockings i have sold for drink
her mohair shawl i sold for drink a present to her long ago her own property not mine and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too
we have three little children and katerina ivanovna is at work from morning till night she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children for she s been used to cleanliness from a child
but her chest is weak and she has a tendency to consumption and i feel it
and the more i drink the more i feel it
i try to find sympathy and feeling in drink
i drink so that i may suffer twice as much
and as though in despair he laid his head down on the table
young man he went on raising his head again in your face i seem to read some trouble of mind
when you came in i read it and that was why i addressed you at once
for in unfolding to you the story of my life i do not wish to make myself a before these idle listeners who indeed know all about it already but i am looking for a man of feeling and education
know then that my wife was educated in a school for the daughters of noblemen and on leaving she danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit
well the medal of course was sold long ago hm but the certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed it to our landlady
and although she is most continually on bad terms with the landlady yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past honours and of the happy days that are gone
i don t condemn her for it i don t blame her for the one thing left her is recollection of the past and all the rest is dust and ashes
yes yes she is a lady of spirit proud and determined
she scrubs the floors herself and has nothing but black bread to eat but won t allow herself to be treated with disrespect
that s why she would not overlook lebeziatnikov s rudeness to her and so when he gave her a beating for it she took to her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows
she was a widow when i married her with three children one smaller than the other
she married her first husband an infantry officer for love and ran away with him from her father s house
she was exceedingly fond of her husband but he gave way to cards got into trouble and with that he died
he used to beat her at the end and although she paid him back of which i have authentic documentary evidence to this day she speaks of him with tears and she throws him up to me and i am glad i am glad that though only in imagination she should think of herself as having once been happy
and she was left at his death with three children in a wild and remote district where i happened to be at the time and she was left in such hopeless poverty that although i have seen many ups and downs of all sort i don t feel equal to describing it even
her relations had all thrown her off
and she was proud too excessively proud
and then honoured sir and then i being at the time a widower with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife offered her my hand for i could not bear the sight of such suffering
you can judge the extremity of her calamities that she a woman of education and culture and distinguished family should have consented to be my wife
weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands she married me
do you understand sir do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn
no that you don t understand yet
and for a whole year i performed my duties conscientiously and faithfully and did not touch this he tapped the jug with his finger for i have feelings
but even so i could not please her and then i lost my place too and that through no fault of mine but through changes in the office and then i did touch it
it will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent capital adorned with innumerable monuments
i obtained it and i lost it again
this time it was through my own fault i lost it for my weakness had come out
we have now part of a room at amalia fyodorovna lippevechsel s and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with i could not say
there are a lot of people living there besides ourselves
dirt and disorder a perfect bedlam
and meanwhile my daughter by my first wife has grown up and what my daughter has had to put up with from her whilst she was growing up i won t speak of
for though katerina ivanovna is full of generous feelings she is a spirited lady irritable and
but it s no use going over that
sonia as you may well fancy has had no education
i did make an effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal history but as i was not very well up in those subjects myself
and we had no suitable books and what books we had
hm anyway we have not even those now so all our instruction came to an end
since she has attained years of maturity she has read other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great interest a book she got through lebeziatnikov lewes physiology do you know it and even recounted extracts from it to us and that s the whole of her education
and now may i venture to address you honoured sir on my own account with a private question
do you suppose that a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work
not fifteen farthings a day can she earn if she is respectable and has no special talent and that without putting her work down for an instant
and what s more ivan ivanitch klopstock the civil counsellor have you heard of him has not to this day paid her for the linen shirts she made him and drove her roughly away stamping and reviling her on the pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were put in askew
and there are the little ones hungry
and katerina ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands her cheeks flushed red as they always are in that disease here you live with us says she you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help
and much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little ones for three days
i was lying drunk and i heard my sonia speaking she is a gentle creature with a soft little voice
fair hair and such a pale thin little face
she said katerina ivanovna am i really to do a thing like that
and darya frantsovna a woman of evil character and very well known to the police had two or three times tried to get at her through the landlady
and why not said katerina ivanovna with a jeer you are something mighty precious to be so careful of
but don t blame her don t blame her honoured sir don t blame her
she was not herself when she spoke but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying of the hungry children and it was said more to wound her than anything else
for that s katerina ivanovna s character and when children cry even from hunger she falls to beating them at once
at six o clock i saw sonia get up put on her kerchief and her cape and go out of the room and about nine o clock she came back
she walked straight up to katerina ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her in silence
she did not utter a word she did not even look at her she simply picked up our big green
drap de shawl we have a shawl made of de put it over her head and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the wall only her little shoulders and her body kept shuddering
and i went on lying there just as before
and then i saw young man i saw katerina ivanovna in the same silence go up to sonia s little bed she was on her knees all the evening kissing sonia s feet and would not get up and then they both fell asleep in each other s arms together together
marmeladov stopped short as though his voice had failed him
then he hurriedly filled his glass drank and cleared his throat
since then sir he went on after a brief pause since then owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by persons in all which darya frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of respect since then my daughter sofya semyonovna has been forced to take a yellow ticket and owing to that she is unable to go on living with us
for our landlady amalia fyodorovna would not hear of it though she had backed up darya frantsovna before and lebeziatnikov too
all the trouble between him and katerina ivanovna was on sonia s account
at first he was for making up to sonia himself and then all of a sudden he stood on his dignity how said he can a highly educated man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that
and katerina ivanovna would not let it pass she stood up for her and so that s how it happened
and sonia comes to us now mostly after dark she comforts katerina ivanovna and gives her all she can
she has a room at the kapernaumovs the tailors she lodges with them kapernaumov is a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft palates too
and his wife too has a cleft palate
they all live in one room but sonia has her own partitioned off
yes very poor people and all with cleft palates
then i got up in the morning and put on my rags lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his excellency ivan afanasyvitch
his excellency ivan afanasyvitch do you know him
well then it s a man of god you don t know
he is wax wax before the face of the lord even as wax melteth
his eyes were dim when he heard my story
marmeladov once already you have deceived my expectations
i ll take you once more on my own responsibility that s what he said remember he said and now you can go
i kissed the dust at his feet in thought only for in reality he would not have allowed me to do it being a statesman and a man of modern political and enlightened ideas
i returned home and when i announced that i d been taken back into the service and should receive a salary heavens what a there was
marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement
at that moment a whole party of revellers already drunk came in from the street and the sounds of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven singing the hamlet were heard in the entry
the and the boys were busy with the
marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story
he appeared by now to be extremely weak but as he became more and more drunk he became more and more talkative
the recollection of his recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him and was positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face
raskolnikov listened attentively
as soon as katerina ivanovna and sonia heard of it mercy on us it was as though i stepped into the kingdom of heaven
it used to be you can lie like a beast nothing but abuse
now they were walking on tiptoe hushing the children
semyon zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office he is resting shh
they made me coffee before i went to work and boiled cream for me
they began to get real cream for me do you hear that
and how they managed to get together the money for a decent outfit eleven roubles fifty copecks i can t guess
boots cotton most magnificent a uniform they got up all in splendid style for eleven roubles and a half
the first morning i came back from the office i found katerina ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner soup and salt meat with horse radish which we had never dreamed of till then
she had not any dresses none at all but she got herself up as though she were going on a visit and not that she d anything to do it with she smartened herself up with nothing at all she d done her hair nicely put on a clean collar of some sort cuffs and there she was quite a different person she was younger and better looking
sonia my little darling had only helped with money for the time she said it won t do for me to come and see you too often
after dark maybe when no one can see
i lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you think though katerina ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with our landlady amalia fyodorovna only a week before she could not resist then asking her in to coffee
for two hours they were sitting whispering together
semyon zaharovitch is in the service again now and receiving a salary says she and he went himself to his excellency and his excellency himself came out to him made all the others wait and led semyon zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into his study
to be sure says he semyon zaharovitch remembering your past services says he and in spite of your propensity to that foolish weakness since you promise now and since moreover we ve got on badly without you do you hear do you hear and so says he i rely now on your word as a gentleman
and all that let me tell you she has simply made up for herself and not simply out of wantonness for the sake of bragging no she believes it all herself she amuses herself with her own fancies upon my word she does
and i don t blame her for it no i don t blame her
six days ago when i brought her my first earnings in full roubles forty copecks altogether she called me her poppet poppet said she my little poppet
and when we were by ourselves you understand
you would not think me a beauty you would not think much of me as a husband would you
well she pinched my cheek my little poppet said she
marmeladov broke off tried to smile but suddenly his chin began to twitch
the tavern the degraded appearance of the man the five nights in the hay barge and the pot of spirits and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered his listener
raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation
he felt vexed that he had come here
honoured sir honoured sir cried marmeladov recovering himself oh sir perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you as it does to others and perhaps i am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the trivial details of my home life but it is not a laughing matter to me
and the whole of that heavenly day of my life and the whole of that evening i passed in fleeting dreams of how i would arrange it all and how i would dress all the children and how i should give her rest and how i should rescue my own daughter from dishonour and restore her to the bosom of her family
well then sir marmeladov suddenly gave a sort of start raised his head and gazed intently at his listener
well on the very next day after all those dreams that is to say exactly five days ago in the evening by a cunning trick like a thief in the night i stole from katerina ivanovna the key of her box took out what was left of my earnings how much it was i have forgotten and now look at me all of you
it s the fifth day since i left home and they are looking for me there and it s the end of my employment and my uniform is lying in a tavern on the egyptian bridge
i exchanged it for the garments i have on and it s the end of everything
marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist clenched his teeth closed his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table
but a minute later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and affectation of bravado he glanced at raskolnikov laughed and said
this morning i went to see sonia i went to ask her for a
you don t say she gave it to you cried one of the he shouted the words and went off into a guffaw
this very quart was bought with her money marmeladov declared addressing himself exclusively to raskolnikov
thirty copecks she gave me with her own hands her last all she had as i saw
she said nothing she only looked at me without a word
they grieve over men they weep but they don t blame them they don t blame them
but it hurts more it hurts more when they don t blame
and maybe she needs them now eh
for now she s got to keep up her appearance
it costs money that smartness that special smartness you know
and there s pomatum too you see she must have things petticoats starched ones shoes too real jaunty ones to show off her foot when she has to step over a puddle
do you understand sir do you understand what all that smartness means
and here i her own father here i took thirty copecks of that money for a drink
come who will have pity on a man like me eh
are you sorry for me sir or not
tell me sir are you sorry or not
he would have filled his glass but there was no drink left
what are you to be pitied for shouted the who was again near them
shouts of laughter and even oaths followed
the laughter and the oaths came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged government clerk
marmeladov suddenly declaimed standing up with his arm outstretched as though he had been only waiting for that question
i ought to be crucified crucified on a cross not pitied
crucify me oh judge crucify me but pity me
and then i will go of myself to be crucified for it s not i seek but tears and tribulation
do you suppose you that sell that this pint of yours has been sweet to me
it was tribulation i sought at the bottom of it tears and tribulation and have found it and i have tasted it but he will pity us who has had pity on all men who has understood all men and all things he is the one he too is the judge
he will come in that day and he will ask where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross consumptive and for the little children of another
where is the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard her earthly father undismayed by his beastliness
i have already forgiven thee once
thy sins which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much
and he will forgive my sonia he will forgive i know it
i felt it in my heart when i was with her just now
and he will judge and will forgive all the good and the evil the wise and the meek
and when he has done with all of them then he will summon us
you too come forth he will say come forth ye drunkards come forth ye weak ones come forth ye children of shame
and we shall all come forth without shame and shall stand before him
and he will say unto us ye are swine made in the image of the beast and with his mark but come ye also
and the wise ones and those of understanding will say oh lord why dost thou receive these men
and he will say this is why i receive them oh ye wise this is why i receive them
oh ye of understanding that not one of them believed himself to be worthy of this
and he will hold out his hands to us and we shall fall down before him and we shall weep and we shall understand all things
and all will understand katerina ivanovna even
and he sank down on the bench exhausted and helpless looking at no one apparently oblivious of his surroundings and plunged in deep thought
his words had created a certain impression there was a moment of silence but soon laughter and oaths were heard again
let us go sir said marmeladov all at once raising his head and addressing raskolnikov come along with me
kozel s house looking into the yard
i m going to katerina ivanovna time i did
raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to help him
marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech and leaned heavily on the young man
they had two or three hundred paces to go
the drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and confusion as they drew nearer the house
it s not katerina ivanovna i am afraid of now he muttered in agitation and that she will begin pulling my hair
indeed it will be better if she does begin pulling it that s not what i am afraid of
it s her eyes i am afraid of yes her eyes the red on her cheeks too frightens me and her breathing too
have you noticed how people in that disease breathe when they are excited
i am frightened of the children s crying too
for if sonia has not taken them food
know sir that such blows are not a pain to me but even an enjoyment
in fact i can t get on without it
let her strike me it relieves her heart
the house of kozel the a german
they went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey
the staircase got darker and darker as they went up
it was nearly eleven o clock and although in summer in petersburg there is no real night yet it was quite dark at the top of the stairs
a grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar
a very room about ten paces long was lighted up by a the whole of it was visible from the entrance
it was all in disorder littered up with rags of all sorts especially children s garments
across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet
there was nothing in the room except two chairs and a sofa covered with american leather full of holes before which stood an old deal unpainted and uncovered
at the edge of the table stood a smoldering in an iron candlestick
it appeared that the family had a room to themselves not part of a room but their room was practically a passage
the door leading to the other rooms or rather cupboards into which amalia lippevechsel s flat was divided stood half open and there was shouting uproar and laughter within
people seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there
words of the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time
raskolnikov recognised katerina ivanovna at once
she was a rather tall slim and graceful woman terribly emaciated with magnificent dark brown hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks
she was pacing up and down in her little room pressing her hands against her chest her lips were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps
her eyes glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare
and that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the playing upon it made a sickening impression
she seemed to raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for marmeladov
she had not heard them and did not notice them coming in
she seemed to be lost in thought hearing and seeing nothing
the room was close but she had not opened the window a stench rose from the staircase but the door on to the stairs was not closed
from the inner rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in she kept coughing but did not close the door
the youngest child a girl of six was asleep sitting curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa
a boy a year older stood crying and shaking in the corner probably he had just had a beating
beside him stood a girl of nine years old tall and thin wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung over her bare shoulders long outgrown and barely reaching her knees
her arm as thin as a stick was round her brother s neck
she was trying to comfort him whispering something to him and doing all she could to keep him from whimpering again
at the same time her large dark eyes which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened face were watching her mother with alarm
marmeladov did not enter the door but dropped on his knees in the very doorway pushing raskolnikov in front of him
the woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently facing him coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what he had come for
but evidently she decided that he was going into the next room as he had to pass through hers to get there
taking no further notice of him she walked towards the outer door to close it and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the doorway
ah she cried out in a frenzy he has come back
and your clothes are all different
marmeladov submissively and obediently held up both arms to facilitate the search
she cried mercy on us can he have drunk it all
there were twelve silver roubles left in the chest
and in a fury she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room
marmeladov seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees
and this is a consolation to me
this does not hurt me but is a positive sir he called out shaken to and fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead
the child asleep on the floor woke up and began to cry
the boy in the corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed to his sister in violent terror almost in a fit
the eldest girl was shaking like a leaf
he s drunk it all the poor woman screamed in despair and his clothes are gone
and they are hungry hungry and wringing her hands she pointed to the children
and you are you not ashamed she pounced all at once upon raskolnikov from the tavern
have you been drinking with him
you have been drinking with him too
the young man was hastening away without uttering a word
the inner door was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it
coarse laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust themselves in at the doorway
further in could be seen figures in dressing gowns flung open in costumes of unseemly scantiness some of them with cards in their hands
they were particularly diverted when marmeladov dragged about by his hair shouted that it was a consolation to him
they even began to come into the room at last a sinister shrill outcry was heard this came from amalia lippevechsel herself pushing her way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day
as he went out raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket to snatch up the coppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to lay them unnoticed on the window
afterwards on the stairs he changed his mind and would have gone back
what a stupid thing i ve done he thought to himself they have sonia and i want it myself
but reflecting that it would be impossible to take it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it he dismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging
sonia wants pomatum too he said as he walked along the street and he laughed malignantly such smartness costs money
and maybe sonia herself will be bankrupt for there is always a risk hunting big game digging for gold
then they would all be without a crust except for my money
and they re making the most of it
yes they are making the most of it
they ve wept over it and grown used to it
man grows used to everything the scoundrel
and what if i am wrong he cried suddenly after a moment s thought
what if man is not really a scoundrel man in general i mean the whole race of mankind then all the rest is prejudice simply artificial terrors and there are no barriers and it s all as it should be
he waked up late next day after a broken sleep
but his sleep had not refreshed him he waked up bilious irritable and looked with hatred at his room
it was a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length
it had a appearance with its dusty yellow paper peeling off the walls and it was so that a man of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment that he would knock his head against the ceiling
the furniture was in keeping with the room there were three old chairs rather rickety a painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long untouched
a big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and half the floor space of the room it was once covered with chintz but was now in rags and served raskolnikov as a bed
often he went to sleep on it as he was without undressing without sheets wrapped in his old student s overcoat with his head on one little pillow under which he heaped up all the linen he had clean and dirty by way of a bolster
a little table stood in front of the sofa
it would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder but to raskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable
he had got completely away from everyone like a tortoise in its shell and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation
he was in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated upon one thing
his landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending him in meals and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her though he went without his dinner
nastasya the cook and only servant was rather pleased at the lodger s mood and had entirely given up sweeping and doing his room only once a week or so she would stray into his room with a broom
it s past nine i have brought you some tea will you have a cup
i should think you re fairly starving
raskolnikov opened his eyes started and recognised nastasya
from the landlady eh he asked slowly and with a sickly face sitting up on the sofa
she set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it
here nastasya take it please he said fumbling in his pocket for he had slept in his clothes and taking out a handful of coppers run and buy me a loaf
and get me a little sausage the cheapest at the s
the loaf i ll fetch you this very minute but wouldn t you rather have some cabbage soup instead of sausage
i saved it for you yesterday but you came in late
when the soup had been brought and he had begun upon it nastasya sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting
she was a country and a very talkative one
praskovya pavlovna means to complain to the police about you she said
you don t pay her money and you won t turn out of the room
that s what she wants to be sure
the devil that s the last straw he muttered grinding his teeth no that would not suit me just now
fool she is and no mistake just as i am
but why if you are so clever do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it
one time you used to go out you say to teach children
but why is it you do nothing now
raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly
i am thinking he answered seriously after a pause
nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter
she was given to laughter and when anything amused her she laughed inaudibly quivering and shaking all over till she felt ill
and have you made much money by your thinking
she managed to articulate at last
one can t go out to give lessons without boots
don t quarrel with your bread and butter
what s the use of a few coppers
he answered reluctantly as though replying to his own thought
and you want to get a fortune all at once
yes i want a fortune he answered firmly after a brief pause
don t be in such a hurry you quite frighten me
shall i get you the loaf or not
a letter came for you yesterday when you were out
i gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it
then bring it to me for god s sake bring it cried raskolnikov greatly excited good god
a minute later the letter was brought him
that was it from his mother from the province of r
it was a long while since he had received a letter but another feeling also suddenly stabbed his heart
nastasya leave me alone for goodness sake here are your three copecks but for goodness sake make haste and go
the letter was quivering in his hand he did not want to open it in her presence he wanted to be left
when nastasya had gone out he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it then he gazed intently at the address the small sloping handwriting so dear and familiar of the mother who had once taught him to read and write
he delayed he seemed almost afraid of something
at last he opened it it was a thick heavy letter weighing over two ounces two large sheets of note paper were covered with very small handwriting
my dear rodya wrote his mother it s two months since i last had a talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me awake at night thinking
but i am sure you will not blame me for my inevitable silence
you know how i love you you are all we have to look to dounia and i you are our all our one hope our one stay
what a grief it was to me when i heard that you had given up the university some months ago for want of means to keep yourself and that you had lost your lessons and your other work
how could i help you out of my hundred and twenty roubles a year pension
the fifteen roubles i sent you four months ago i borrowed as you know on security of my pension from vassily ivanovitch vahrushin a merchant of this town
he is a man and was a friend of your father s too
but having given him the right to receive the pension i had to wait till the debt was paid off and that is only just done so that i ve been unable to send you anything all this time
but now thank god i believe i shall be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate ourselves on our good fortune now of which i hasten to inform you
in the first place would you have guessed dear rodya that your sister has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be separated in the future
thank god her sufferings are over but i will tell you everything in order so that you may know just how everything has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you
when you wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that dounia had a great deal to put up with in the svidriga√Ølovs house when you wrote that and asked me to tell you all about it what could i write in answer to you
if i had written the whole truth to you i dare say you would have thrown up everything and have come to us even if you had to walk all the way for i know your character and your feelings and you would not let your sister be insulted
i was in despair myself but what could i do
and besides i did not know the whole truth myself then
what made it all so difficult was that dounia received a hundred roubles in advance when she took the place as governess in their family on condition of part of her salary being deducted every month and so it was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt
this sum now i can explain it all to you my precious rodya she took chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles which you needed so terribly then and which you received from us last year
we deceived you then writing that this money came from dounia s savings but that was not so and now i tell you all about it because thank god things have suddenly changed for the better and that you may know how dounia loves you and what a heart she has
at first indeed svidriga√Ølov treated her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at table
but i don t want to go into all those painful details so as not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over
in short in spite of the kind and generous behaviour of marfa petrovna svidriga√Ølov s wife and all the rest of the household dounia had a very hard time especially when svidriga√Ølov relapsing into his old regimental habits was under the influence of bacchus
and how do you think it was all explained later on
would you believe that the crazy fellow had conceived a passion for dounia from the beginning but had concealed it under a show of rudeness and contempt
possibly he was ashamed and horrified himself at his own flighty hopes considering his years and his being the father of a family and that made him angry with dounia
and possibly too he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide the truth from others
but at last he lost all control and had the face to make dounia an open and shameful proposal promising her all sorts of inducements and offering besides to throw up everything and take her to another estate of his or even abroad
you can imagine all she went through
to leave her situation at once was impossible not only on account of the money debt but also to spare the feelings of marfa petrovna whose suspicions would have been aroused and then dounia would have been the cause of a rupture in the family
and it would have meant a terrible scandal for dounia too that would have been inevitable
there were various other reasons owing to which dounia could not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks
you know dounia of course you know how clever she is and what a strong will she has
dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness
she did not even write to me about everything for fear of upsetting me although we were constantly in communication
marfa petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring dounia in the garden and putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position threw the blame upon her believing her to be the cause of it all
an awful scene took place between them on the spot in the garden marfa petrovna went so far as to strike dounia refused to hear anything and was shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that dounia should be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant s cart into which they flung all her things her linen and her clothes all without folding it up and packing it
and a heavy shower of rain came on too and dounia insulted and put to shame had to drive with a peasant in an open cart all the seventeen versts into town
only think now what answer could i have sent to the letter i received from you two months ago and what could i have written
i was in despair i dared not write to you the truth because you would have been very unhappy mortified and indignant and yet what could you do
you could only perhaps ruin yourself and besides dounia would not allow it and fill up my letter with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow i could not
for a whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal and it came to such a pass that dounia
and i dared not even go to church on account of the contemptuous looks whispers and even remarks made aloud about us
all our acquaintances avoided us nobody even bowed to us in the street and i learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to insult us in a shameful way smearing the gates of our house with pitch so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave
all this was set going by marfa petrovna who managed to slander dounia and throw dirt at her in every family
she knows everyone in the neighbourhood and that month she was continually coming into the town and as she is rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband which is not at all right so in a short time she had spread her story not only in the town but over the whole surrounding district
it made me ill but dounia bore it better than i did and if only you could have seen how she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up
but by god s mercy our sufferings were cut short svidriga√Ølov returned to his senses and repented and probably feeling sorry for dounia he laid before marfa petrovna a complete and unmistakable proof of dounia s innocence in the form of a letter dounia had been forced to write and give to him before marfa petrovna came upon them in the garden
this letter which remained in svidriga√Ølov s hands after her departure she had written to refuse personal explanations and secret interviews for which he was entreating her
in that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to marfa petrovna reminding him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl unhappy enough already
indeed dear rodya the letter was so nobly and touchingly written that i sobbed when i read it and to this day i can not read it without tears
moreover the evidence of the servants too cleared dounia s reputation they had seen and known a great deal more than svidriga√Ølov had himself supposed as indeed is always the case with servants
marfa petrovna was completely taken aback and again crushed as she said herself to us but she was completely convinced of dounia s innocence
the very next day being sunday she went straight to the cathedral knelt down and prayed with tears to our lady to give her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty
then she came straight from the cathedral to us told us the whole story wept bitterly and fully penitent she embraced dounia and besought her to forgive her
the same morning without any delay she went round to all the houses in the town and everywhere shedding tears she asserted in the most flattering terms dounia s innocence and the nobility of her feelings and her behavior
what was more she showed and read to everyone the letter in dounia s own handwriting to svidriga√Ølov and even allowed them to take copies of it which i must say i think was superfluous
in this way she was busy for several days in driving about the whole town because some people had taken offence through precedence having been given to others
and therefore they had to take turns so that in every house she was expected before she arrived and everyone knew that on such and such a day marfa petrovna would be reading the letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading of it even many who had heard it several times already both in their own houses and in other people s
in my opinion a great deal a very great deal of all this was unnecessary but that s marfa petrovna s character
anyway she succeeded in completely dounia s reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible disgrace upon her husband as the only person to blame so that i really began to feel sorry for him it was really treating the crazy fellow too harshly
dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families but she refused
all of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which one may say our whole fortunes are now transformed
you must know dear rodya that dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry him
i hasten to tell you all about the matter and though it has been arranged without asking your consent i think you will not be aggrieved with me or with your sister on that account for you will see that we could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you
and you could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot
he is already of the rank of a counsellor pyotr petrovitch luzhin and is distantly related to marfa petrovna who has been very active in bringing the match about
it began with his expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance
he was properly received drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a speedy and decided answer
he is a very busy man and is in a great hurry to get to petersburg so that every moment is precious to him
at first of course we were greatly surprised as it had all happened so quickly and unexpectedly
we thought and talked it over the whole day
he is a man to be depended upon he has two posts in the government and has already made his fortune
it is true that he is years old but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be thought attractive by women and he is altogether a very respectable and presentable man only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited
but possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight
and beware dear rodya when he comes to petersburg as he shortly will do beware of judging him too hastily and severely as your way is if there is anything you do not like in him at first sight
i give you this warning although i feel sure that he will make a favourable impression upon you
moreover in order to understand any man one must be deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards
and pyotr petrovitch judging by many indications is a thoroughly estimable man
at his first visit indeed he told us that he was a practical man but still he shares as he expressed it many of the convictions of our most rising generation and he is an opponent of all prejudices
he said a good deal more for he seems a little conceited and likes to be listened to but this is scarcely a vice
i of course understood very little of it but dounia explained to me that though he is not a man of great education he is clever and seems to be
you know your sister s character rodya
she is a resolute sensible patient and generous girl but she has a passionate heart as i know very well
of course there is no great love either on his side or on hers but dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel and will make it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her happiness his care
of that we have no good reason to doubt though it must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste
besides he is a man of great prudence and he will see to be sure of himself that his own happiness will be the more secure the happier dounia is with him
and as for some defects of character for some habits and even certain differences of opinion which indeed are inevitable even in the happiest marriages dounia has said that as regards all that she relies on herself that there is nothing to be uneasy about and that she is ready to put up with a great deal if only their future relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one
he struck me for instance at first as rather abrupt but that may well come from his being an outspoken man and that is no doubt how it is
for instance at his second visit after he had received dounia s consent in the course of conversation he declared that before making dounia s acquaintance he had made up his mind to marry a girl of good reputation without dowry and above all one who had experienced poverty because as he explained a man ought not to be indebted to his wife but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her benefactor
i must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely than i have done for i have forgotten his actual phrases and only remember the meaning
and besides it was obviously not said of design but slipped out in the heat of conversation so that he tried afterwards to correct himself and smooth it over but all the same it did strike me as somewhat rude and i said so afterwards to dounia
but dounia was vexed and answered that words are not deeds and that of course is perfectly true
dounia did not sleep all night before she made up her mind and thinking that i was asleep she got out of bed and was walking up and down the room all night at last she knelt down before the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me that she had decided
i have mentioned already that pyotr petrovitch is just setting off for petersburg where he has a great deal of business and he wants to open a legal bureau
he has been occupied for many years in conducting civil and commercial litigation and only the other day he won an important case
he has to be in petersburg because he has an important case before the senate
so rodya dear he may be of the greatest use to you in every way indeed and dounia and i have agreed that from this very day you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that your future is marked out and assured for you
this would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a providential blessing
dounia is dreaming of nothing else
we have even ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to pyotr petrovitch
he was cautious in his answer and said that of course as he could not get on without a secretary it would be better to be paying a salary to a relation than to a stranger if only the former were fitted for the duties as though there could be doubt of your being fitted
but then he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave you time for work at his office
the matter dropped for the time but dounia is thinking of nothing else now
she has been in a sort of fever for the last few days and has already made a regular plan for your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in pyotr petrovitch s business which might well be seeing that you are a student of law
i am in complete agreement with her rodya and share all her plans and hopes and think there is every probability of realising them
and in spite of pyotr petrovitch s evasiveness very natural at present since he does not know you dounia is firmly persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her future husband this she is reckoning upon
of course we are careful not to talk of any of these more remote plans to pyotr petrovitch especially of your becoming his partner
he is a practical man and might take this very coldly it might all seem to him simply a
nor has either dounia or i breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have of his helping us to pay for your university studies we have not spoken of it in the first place because it will come to pass of itself later on and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of himself as though he could refuse dounia that the more readily since you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office and receive this assistance not as a charity but as a salary earned by your own work
dounia wants to arrange it all like this and i quite agree with her
and we have not spoken of our plans for another reason that is because i particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when you first meet him
when dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about you he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing him close for oneself and that he looked forward to forming his own opinion when he makes your acquaintance
do you know my precious rodya i think that perhaps for some reasons nothing to do with pyotr petrovitch though simply for my own personal perhaps fancies
i should do better to go on living by myself apart than with them after the wedding
i am convinced that he will be generous and delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter for the future and if he has said nothing about it hitherto it is simply because it has been taken for granted but i shall refuse
i have noticed more than once in my life that husbands don t quite get on with their and i don t want to be the least bit in anyone s way and for my own sake too would rather be quite independent so long as i have a crust of bread of my own and such children as you and dounia
if possible i would settle somewhere near you for the most joyful piece of news dear rodya i have kept for the end of my letter know then my dear boy that we may perhaps be all together in a very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of almost three years
it is settled that dounia and i are to set off for petersburg exactly when i don t know but very very soon possibly in a week
it all depends on pyotr petrovitch who will let us know when he has had time to look round him in petersburg
to suit his own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible even before the fast of our lady if it could be managed or if that is too soon to be ready immediately after
oh with what happiness i shall press you to my heart
dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought of seeing you she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry pyotr petrovitch for that alone
she is not writing anything to you now and has only told me to write that she has so much so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now for a few lines would tell you nothing and it would only mean upsetting herself she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses
but although we shall be meeting so soon perhaps i shall send you as much money as i can in a day or two
now that everyone has heard that dounia is to marry pyotr petrovitch my credit has suddenly improved and i know that afanasy ivanovitch will trust me now even to roubles on the security of my pension so that perhaps i shall be able to send you or even thirty roubles
i would send you more but i am uneasy about our travelling expenses for though pyotr petrovitch has been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey that is to say he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big trunk which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his we must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in petersburg where we can t be left without a halfpenny at least for the first few days
but we have calculated it all dounia and i to the last penny and we see that the journey will not cost very much
it is only ninety versts from us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we know so as to be in readiness and from there dounia
and i can travel quite comfortably third class
so that i may very likely be able to send to you not but thirty roubles
but enough i have covered two sheets already and there is no space left for more our whole history but so many events have happened
and now my precious rodya i embrace you and send you a mother s blessing till we meet
love dounia your sister rodya love her as she loves you and understand that she loves you beyond everything more than herself
she is an angel and you rodya you are everything to us our one hope our one consolation
if only you are happy we shall be happy
do you still say your prayers rodya and believe in the mercy of our creator and our redeemer
i am afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of infidelity that is abroad if it is so i pray for you
remember dear boy how in your childhood when your father was living you used to lisp your prayers at my knee and how happy we all were in those days
till we meet then i embrace you warmly warmly with many kisses
yours till death pulcheria raskolnikov
almost from the first while he read the letter raskolnikov s face was wet with tears but when he finished it his face was pale and distorted and a bitter wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips
he laid his head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered pondered a long time
his heart was beating violently and his brain was in a turmoil
at last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was like a cupboard or a box
his eyes and his mind craved for space
he took up his hat and went out this time without dread of meeting anyone he had forgotten his dread
he turned in the direction of the vassilyevsky ostrov walking along vassilyevsky prospect as though hastening on some business but he walked as his habit was without noticing his way muttering and even speaking aloud to himself to the astonishment of the
many of them took him to be drunk
his mother s letter had been a torture to him but as regards the chief fact in it he had felt not one moment s hesitation even whilst he was reading the letter
the essential question was settled and irrevocably settled in his mind never such a marriage while i am alive and luzhin be damned
the thing is perfectly clear he muttered to himself with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his decision
no mother no dounia you won t deceive me
and then they apologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without me
they imagine it is arranged now and can t be broken off but we will see whether it can or not
a magnificent excuse pyotr petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in almost by express
and i know what you want to say to me and i know too what you were thinking about when you walked up and down all night and what your prayers were like before the holy mother of kazan who stands in mother s bedroom
bitter is the ascent to golgotha
so it is finally settled you have determined to marry a sensible business man avdotya romanovna one who has a fortune has made his fortune that is so much more solid and impressive a man who holds two government posts and who shares the ideas of our most rising generation as mother writes and who to be kind as dounia herself observes
and that very dounia for that very is marrying him
but i should like to know why mother has written to me about our most rising generation
simply as a descriptive touch or with the idea of prepossessing me in favour of luzhin
i should like to know one thing more how far they were open with one another that day and night and all this time since
was it all put into or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their minds so that there was no need to speak of it aloud and better not to speak of it
most likely it was partly like that from mother s letter it s evident he struck her as rude and mother in her simplicity took her observations to dounia
and she was sure to be vexed and answered her angrily
who would not be angered when it was quite clear without any na√Øve questions and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it
and why does she write to me love dounia rodya and she loves you more than herself
has she a secret at sacrificing her daughter to her son
you are our one comfort you are everything to us
his bitterness grew more and more intense and if he had happened to meet luzhin at the moment he might have murdered him
hm yes that s true he continued pursuing the whirling ideas that chased each other in his brain it is true that it needs time and care to get to know a man but there is no mistake about luzhin
the chief thing is he is a man of business and kind that was something wasn t it to send the bags and big box for them
but his and her mother are to drive in a peasant s cart covered with sacking i know i have been driven in it
it is only ninety versts and then they can travel very comfortably third class for a thousand versts
one must cut one s coat according to one s cloth but what about you luzhin
and you must be aware that her mother has to raise money on her pension for the journey
to be sure it s a matter of business a partnership for mutual benefit with equal shares and expenses food and drink provided but pay for your tobacco
the business man has got the better of them too
the luggage will cost less than their fares and very likely go for nothing
how is it that they don t both see all that or is it that they don t want to see
and to think that this is only the first blossoming and that the real fruits are to come
but what really matters is not the stinginess is not the meanness but the of the whole thing
for that will be the tone after marriage it s a foretaste of it
and mother too why should she be so lavish
what will she have by the time she gets to petersburg
three silver roubles or two paper ones as says that old woman
what does she expect to live upon in petersburg afterwards
she has her reasons already for guessing that she live with dounia after the marriage even for the first few months
the good man has no doubt let slip something on that subject also though mother would deny it i shall refuse says she
is she counting on what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when afanasy ivanovitch s debt is paid
she knits woollen shawls and embroiders cuffs ruining her old eyes
and all her shawls don t add more than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty i know that
so she is building all her hopes all the time on luzhin s generosity he will offer it of himself he will press it on me
you may wait a long time for that
that s how it always is with these schilleresque noble hearts till the last moment every goose is a swan with them till the last moment they hope for the best and will see nothing wrong and although they have an inkling of the other side of the picture yet they won t face the truth till they are forced to the very thought of it makes them shiver they thrust the truth away with both hands until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool s cap on them with his own hands
i should like to know whether luzhin has any orders of merit i bet he has the anna in his buttonhole and that he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants
he will be sure to have it for his wedding too
well mother i don t wonder at it s like her god bless her but how could dounia
dounia darling as though i did not know you
you were nearly twenty when i saw you last i understood you then
mother writes that dounia can put up with a great deal
i knew that two years and a half ago and for the last two and a half years i have been thinking about it thinking of just that that dounia can put up with a great deal
if she could put up with svidriga√Ølov and all the rest of it she certainly can put up with a great deal
and now mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up with luzhin who propounds the theory of the superiority of wives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband s bounty who propounds it too almost at the first interview
granted that he let it slip though he is a sensible man yet maybe it was not a slip at all but he meant to make himself clear as soon as possible but dounia dounia
she understands the man of course but she will have to live with the man
she d live on black bread and water she would not sell her soul she would not barter her moral freedom for comfort she would not barter it for all much less luzhin s money
no dounia was not that sort when i knew her
and she is still the same of course
yes there s no denying the svidriga√Ølovs are a bitter pill
it s a bitter thing to spend one s life a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles but i know she would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a lett with a german master than degrade her soul and her moral dignity by binding herself for ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has nothing in common for her own advantage
and if luzhin had been of unalloyed gold or one huge diamond she would never have consented to become his legal concubine
it s clear enough for herself for her comfort to save her life she would not sell herself but for someone else she is doing it
for one she loves for one she adores she will sell herself
that s what it all amounts to for her brother for her mother she will sell herself
in such cases we overcome our moral feeling if necessary freedom peace conscience even all all are brought into the market
let my life go if only my dear ones may be happy
more than that we become casuists we learn to be jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves we can persuade ourselves that it is one s duty for a good object
that s just like us it s as clear as daylight
it s clear that rodion romanovitch raskolnikov is the central figure in the business and no one else
oh yes she can ensure his happiness keep him in the university make him a partner in the office make his whole future secure perhaps he may even be a rich man later on prosperous respected and may even end his life a famous man
it s all rodya precious rodya her first born
for such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter
why for his sake we would not shrink even from sonia s fate
sonia sonia marmeladov the eternal victim so long as the world lasts
have you taken the measure of your sacrifice both of you
and let me tell you dounia sonia s life is no worse than life with luzhin
there can be no question of love mother writes
and what if there can be no respect either if on the contrary there is aversion contempt repulsion what then
so you will have to keep up your appearance too
do you understand what that smartness means
do you understand that the luzhin smartness is just the same thing as sonia s and may be worse viler baser because in your case dounia it s a bargain for luxuries after all but with sonia it s simply a question of starvation
it has to be paid for it has to be paid for dounia this smartness
and what if it s more than you can bear afterwards if you regret it
the bitterness the misery the curses the tears hidden from all the world for you are not a marfa petrovna
and how will your mother feel then
even now she is uneasy she is worried but then when she sees it all clearly
yes indeed what have you taken me for
i won t have your sacrifice dounia i won t have it mother
it shall not be so long as i am alive it shall not it shall not
he suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still
but what are you going to do to prevent it
what can you promise them on your side to give you such a right
your whole life your whole future you will devote to them you have finished your studies and obtained a
yes we have heard all that before and that s all but now
now something must be done now do you understand that
they borrow on their hundred roubles pension
they borrow from the svidriga√Ølovs
how are you going to save them from svidriga√Ølovs from afanasy ivanovitch vahrushin oh future millionaire zeus who would arrange their lives for them
in another ten years mother will be blind with knitting shawls maybe with weeping too
she will be worn to a shadow with fasting and my sister
imagine for a moment what may have become of your sister in ten years
what may happen to her during those ten years
so he tortured himself fretting himself with such questions and finding a kind of enjoyment in it
and yet all these questions were not new ones suddenly confronting him they were old familiar aches
it was long since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart
long long ago his present anguish had its first beginnings it had waxed and gathered strength it had matured and concentrated until it had taken the form of a fearful frenzied and fantastic question which tortured his heart and mind clamouring insistently for an answer
now his mother s letter had burst on him like a thunderclap
it was clear that he must not now suffer passively worrying himself over unsolved questions but that he must do something do it at once and do it quickly
anyway he must decide on something or else or throw up life altogether
he cried suddenly in a frenzy accept one s lot humbly as it is once for all and stifle everything in oneself giving up all claim to activity life and love
marmeladov s question came suddenly into his mind for every man must have somewhere to turn
he gave a sudden start another thought that he had had yesterday slipped back into his mind
but he did not start at the thought recurring to him for he knew he had that it must come back he was expecting it besides it was not only yesterday s thought
the difference was that a month ago yesterday even the thought was a mere dream but now now it appeared not a dream at all it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape and he suddenly became aware of this himself
he felt a hammering in his head and there was a darkness before his eyes
he looked round hurriedly he was searching for something
he wanted to sit down and was looking for a seat he was walking along the k boulevard
there was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him
he walked towards it as fast he could but on the way he met with a little adventure which absorbed all his attention
looking for the seat he had noticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him but at first he took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his path
it had happened to him many times going home not to notice the road by which he was going and he was accustomed to walk like that
but there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front of him that gradually his attention was riveted upon her at first reluctantly and as it were resentfully and then more and more intently
he felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so strange about the woman
in the first place she appeared to be a girl quite young and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with no parasol or gloves waving her arms about in an absurd way
she had on a dress of some light silky material but put on strangely awry not properly hooked up and torn open at the top of the skirt close to the waist a great piece was rent and hanging loose
a little kerchief was flung about her bare throat but lay slanting on one side
the girl was walking unsteadily too stumbling and staggering from side to side
she drew raskolnikov s whole attention at last
he overtook the girl at the seat but on reaching it she dropped down on it in the corner she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes apparently in extreme exhaustion
looking at her closely he saw at once that she was completely drunk
it was a strange and shocking sight
he could hardly believe that he was not mistaken
he saw before him the face of a quite young girl sixteen perhaps not more than fifteen years old pretty little face but flushed and heavy looking and as it were swollen
the girl seemed hardly to know what she was doing she crossed one leg over the other lifting it indecorously and showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street
raskolnikov did not sit down but he felt unwilling to leave her and stood facing her in perplexity
this boulevard was never much frequented and now at two o clock in the stifling heat it was quite deserted
and yet on the further side of the boulevard about fifteen paces away a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement
he too would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object of his own
he too had probably seen her in the distance and had followed her but found raskolnikov in his way
he looked angrily at him though he tried to escape his notice and stood impatiently biding his time till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away
his intentions were unmistakable
the gentleman was a plump man about thirty fashionably dressed with a high colour red lips and moustaches
raskolnikov felt furious he had a sudden longing to insult this fat dandy in some way
he left the girl for a moment and walked towards the gentleman
he shouted clenching his fists and laughing spluttering with rage
the gentleman asked sternly scowling in haughty astonishment
raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists without reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like himself
but at that instant someone seized him from behind and a police constable stood between them
that s enough gentlemen no fighting please in a public place
he asked raskolnikov sternly noticing his rags
raskolnikov looked at him intently
he had a sensible soldierly face with grey moustaches and whiskers
you are just the man i want raskolnikov cried catching at his arm
you may as well know that too he added addressing the gentleman come along i have something to show you
and taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat
look here hopelessly drunk and she has just come down the boulevard
there is no telling who and what she is she does not look like a professional
it s more likely she has been given drink and deceived somewhere for the first time
and they ve put her out into the street like that
look at the way her dress is torn and the way it has been put on she has been dressed by somebody she has not dressed herself and dressed by unpractised hands by a man s hands that s evident
and now look there i don t know that dandy with whom i was going to fight i see him for the first time but he too has seen her on the road just now drunk not knowing what she is doing and now he is very eager to get hold of her to get her away somewhere while she is in this state
that s certain believe me i am not wrong
i saw him myself watching her and following her but i prevented him and he is just waiting for me to go away
now he has walked away a little and is standing still pretending to make a cigarette
think how can we keep her out of his hands and how are we to get her home
the policeman saw it all in a flash
the stout gentleman was easy to understand he turned to consider the girl
the policeman bent over to examine her more closely and his face worked with genuine compassion
he said shaking his head why she is quite a child
she has been deceived you can see that at once
listen lady he began addressing her where do you live
the girl opened her weary and eyes gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her hand
here said raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty copecks here call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address
the only thing is to find out her address
the policeman began again taking the money
i ll fetch you a cab and take you home myself
they won t let me alone the girl muttered and once more waved her hand
it s shameful missy it s a shame
he shook his head again shocked sympathetic and indignant
it s a difficult job the policeman said to raskolnikov and as he did so he looked him up and down in a rapid glance
he too must have seemed a strange figure to him dressed in rags and handing him money
i tell you she was walking in front of me staggering just here in the boulevard
she only just reached the seat and sank down on it
ah the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays god have mercy on us
an innocent creature like that drunk already
she has been deceived that s a sure thing
see how her dress has been torn too
and as likely as not she belongs to gentlefolk too poor ones maybe
there are many like that nowadays
she looks refined too as though she were a lady and he bent over her once more
perhaps he had daughters growing up like that looking like ladies and refined with pretensions to gentility and smartness
the chief thing is raskolnikov persisted to keep her out of this scoundrel s hands
it s as clear as day what he is after ah the brute he is not moving off
raskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him
the gentleman heard him and seemed about to fly into a rage again but thought better of it and confined himself to a contemptuous look
he then walked slowly another ten paces away and again halted
keep her out of his hands we can said the constable thoughtfully if only she d tell us where to take her but as it is
she opened her eyes fully all of a sudden looked at him intently as though realising something got up from the seat and walked away in the direction from which she had come
oh shameful wretches they won t let me alone
she walked quickly though staggering as before
the dandy followed her but along another avenue keeping his eye on her
don t be anxious i won t let him have her the policeman said resolutely and he set off after them
at that moment something seemed to sting raskolnikov in an instant a complete revulsion of feeling came over him
he pointed at the dandy what is it to do with you
the policeman was bewildered and stared at him
well ejaculated the policeman with a gesture of contempt and he walked after the dandy and the girl probably taking raskolnikov for a madman or something even worse
he has carried off my twenty copecks raskolnikov murmured angrily when he was left alone
well let him take as much from the other fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end
and why did i want to interfere
let them devour each other alive what is it to me
how did i dare to give him twenty copecks
in spite of those strange words he felt very wretched
he sat down on the deserted seat
he found it hard to fix his mind on anything at that moment
he longed to forget himself altogether to forget everything and then to wake up and begin life anew
he said looking at the empty corner where she had sat she will come to herself and weep and then her mother will find out
she will give her a beating a horrible shameful beating and then maybe turn her out of doors
and even if she does not the darya frantsovnas will get wind of it and the girl will soon be slipping out on the sly here and there
then there will be the hospital directly that s always the luck of those girls with respectable mothers who go wrong on the sly and then again the hospital drink the taverns and more hospital in two or three years a wreck and her life over at eighteen or nineteen have not i seen cases like that
and how have they been brought to it
why they ve all come to it like that
that s as it should be they tell us
a certain percentage they tell us must every year go that way to the devil i suppose so that the rest may remain chaste and not be interfered with
what splendid words they have they are so scientific so consolatory
once you ve said percentage there s nothing more to worry about
maybe we might feel more uneasy
but what if dounia were one of the percentage
strange i came out for something
as soon as i had read the letter i came out
i was going to vassilyevsky ostrov to razumihin
and what put the idea of going to razumihin into my head just now
razumihin was one of his old comrades at the university
it was remarkable that raskolnikov had hardly any friends at the university he kept aloof from everyone went to see no one and did not welcome anyone who came to see him and indeed everyone soon gave him up
he took no part in the students gatherings amusements or conversations
he worked with great intensity without sparing himself and he was respected for this but no one liked him
he was very poor and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him as though he were keeping something to himself
he seemed to some of his comrades to look down upon them all as children as though he were superior in development knowledge and convictions as though their beliefs and interests were beneath him
with razumihin he had got on or at least he was more unreserved and communicative with him
indeed it was impossible to be on any other terms with razumihin
he was an exceptionally and candid youth to the point of simplicity though both depth and dignity lay concealed under that simplicity
the better of his comrades understood this and all were fond of him
he was extremely intelligent though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times
he was of striking appearance tall thin blackhaired and always badly shaved
he was sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength
one night when out in a festive company he had with one blow laid a gigantic policeman on his back
there was no limit to his drinking powers but he could abstain from drink altogether he sometimes went too far in his pranks but he could do without pranks altogether
another thing striking about razumihin no failure distressed him and it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him
he could lodge anywhere and bear the extremes of cold and hunger
he was very poor and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of one sort or another
he knew of no end of resources by which to earn money
he spent one whole winter without lighting his stove and used to declare that he liked it better because one slept more soundly in the cold
for the present he too had been obliged to give up the university but it was only for a time and he was working with all his might to save enough to return to his studies again
raskolnikov had not been to see him for the last four months and razumihin did not even know his address
about two months before they had met in the street but raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that he might not be observed
and though razumihin noticed him he passed him by as he did not want to annoy him
chapter v of course i ve been meaning lately to go to razumihin s to ask for work to ask him to get me lessons or something
raskolnikov thought but what help can he be to me now
suppose he gets me lessons suppose he shares his last farthing with me if he has any farthings so that i could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons
what shall i do with the few coppers i earn
it s really absurd for me to go to razumihin
the question why he was now going to razumihin agitated him even more than he was himself aware he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister significance in this apparently ordinary action
could i have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by means of razumihin alone
he pondered and rubbed his forehead and strange to say after long musing suddenly as if it were spontaneously and by chance a fantastic thought came into his head
hm to razumihin s he said all at once calmly as though he had reached a final determination
i shall go to razumihin s of course but not now
i shall go to him on the next day after it when it will be over and everything will begin afresh
and suddenly he realised what he was thinking
after it he shouted jumping up from the seat but is it really going to happen
is it possible it really will happen
he left the seat and went off almost at a run he meant to turn back homewards but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing in that hole in that awful little cupboard of his all had for a month past been growing up in him and he walked on at random
his nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel shivering in spite of the heat he felt cold
with a kind of effort he began almost unconsciously from some inner craving to stare at all the objects before him as though looking for something to distract his attention but he did not succeed and kept dropping every moment into brooding
when with a start he lifted his head again and looked round he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he was going
in this way he walked right across vassilyevsky ostrov came out on to the lesser neva crossed the bridge and turned towards the islands
the greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in and weighed upon him
here there were no taverns no stifling closeness no stench
but soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid irritability
sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer villa standing among green foliage he gazed through the fence he saw in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies and children running in the gardens
the flowers especially caught his attention he gazed at them longer than at anything
he was met too by luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback he watched them with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from his sight
once he stood still and counted his money he found he had thirty copecks
twenty to the policeman three to nastasya for the letter so i must have given or fifty to the marmeladovs yesterday he thought reckoning it up for some unknown reason but he soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket
he recalled it on passing an or tavern and felt that he was hungry
going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a pie of some sort
he finished eating it as he walked away
it was a long while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once though he only drank a wineglassful
his legs felt suddenly heavy and a great drowsiness came upon him
he turned homewards but reaching petrovsky ostrov he stopped completely exhausted turned off the road into the bushes sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep
in a morbid condition of the brain dreams often have a singular actuality vividness and extraordinary semblance of reality
at times monstrous images are created but the setting and the whole picture are so and filled with details so delicate so unexpectedly but so artistically consistent that the dreamer were he an artist like pushkin or turgenev even could never have invented them in the waking state
such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system
raskolnikov had a fearful dream
he dreamt he was back in his childhood in the little town of his birth
he was a child about seven years old walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday
it was a grey and heavy day the country was exactly as he remembered it indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in memory
the little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand not even a willow near it only in the far distance a copse lay a dark blur on the very edge of the horizon
a few paces beyond the last market garden stood a tavern a big tavern which had always aroused in him a feeling of aversion even of fear when he walked by it with his father
there was always a crowd there always shouting laughter and abuse hideous hoarse singing and often fighting
drunken and figures were hanging about the tavern
he used to cling close to his father trembling all over when he met them
near the tavern the road became a dusty track the dust of which was always black
it was a winding road and about a hundred paces further on it turned to the right to the graveyard
in the middle of the graveyard stood a stone church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three times a year with his father and mother when a service was held in memory of his grandmother who had long been dead and whom he had never seen
on these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in the shape of a cross
he loved that church the unadorned ikons and the old priest with the shaking head
near his grandmother s grave which was marked by a stone was the little grave of his younger brother who had died at six months old
he did not remember him at all but he had been told about his little brother and whenever he visited the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and to bow down and kiss the little grave
and now he dreamt that he was walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard he was holding his father s hand and looking with dread at the tavern
a peculiar circumstance attracted his attention there seemed to be some kind of festivity going on there were crowds of gaily dressed townspeople peasant women their husbands and of all sorts all singing and all more or less drunk
near the entrance of the tavern stood a cart but a strange cart
it was one of those big carts usually drawn by heavy and laden with casks of wine or other heavy goods
he always liked looking at those great with their long manes thick legs and slow even pace drawing along a perfect mountain with no appearance of effort as though it were easier going with a load than without it
but now strange to say in the shafts of such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast one of those peasants nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load of wood or hay especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in a rut
and the peasants would beat them so cruelly sometimes even about the nose and eyes and he felt so sorry so sorry for them that he almost cried and his mother always used to take him away from the window
all of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting singing and the balala√Øka and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken peasants came out wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over their shoulders
get in get in shouted one of them a young peasant with a fleshy face red as a carrot
but at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the crowd
take us all with a beast like that
why mikolka are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart
and this mare is twenty if she is a day mates
get in i ll take you all mikolka shouted again leaping first into the cart seizing the reins and standing straight up in front
the bay has gone with matvey he shouted from the cart and this brute mates is just breaking my heart i feel as if i could kill her
and he picked up the whip preparing himself with relish to flog the little mare
she has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years
don t you mind her mates bring a whip each of you get ready
they all clambered into mikolka s cart laughing and making jokes
six men got in and there was still room for more
she was dressed in red cotton in a pointed beaded headdress and thick leather shoes she was cracking nuts and laughing
the crowd round them was laughing too and indeed how could they help laughing
that wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a gallop
two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to help mikolka
with the cry of now the mare tugged with all her might but far from galloping could scarcely move forward she struggled with her legs gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which were showered upon her like hail
the laughter in the cart and in the crowd was redoubled but mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed the mare as though he supposed she really could gallop
let me get in too mates shouted a young man in the crowd whose appetite was aroused
get in all get in cried mikolka she will draw you all
and he thrashed and thrashed at the mare beside himself with fury
father father he cried father what are they doing
father they are beating the poor horse
come along come along said his father
they are drunken and foolish they are in fun come away don t look
and he tried to draw him away but he tore himself away from his hand and beside himself with horror ran to the horse
the poor beast was in a bad way
she was gasping standing still then tugging again and almost falling
beat her to death cried mikolka it s come to that
what are you about are you a christian you devil shouted an old man in the crowd
a wretched nag like that pulling such a cartload said another
you ll kill her shouted the third
it s my property i ll do what i choose
all at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything the mare roused by the shower of blows began feebly kicking
even the old man could not help smiling
to think of a wretched little beast like that trying to kick
two lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her about the ribs
hit her in the face in the eyes in the eyes cried mikolka
give us a song mates shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the cart joined in a riotous song jingling a tambourine and whistling
the woman went on cracking nuts and laughing
he ran beside the mare ran in front of her saw her being whipped across the eyes right in the eyes
he was crying he felt choking his tears were streaming
one of the men gave him a cut with the whip across the face he did not feel it
wringing his hands and screaming he rushed up to the old man with the grey beard who was shaking his head in disapproval
one woman seized him by the hand and would have taken him away but he tore himself from her and ran back to the mare
she was almost at the last gasp but began kicking once more
i ll teach you to kick mikolka shouted ferociously
he threw down the whip bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long thick shaft he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort brandished it over the mare
he ll crush her was shouted round him
it s my property shouted mikolka and brought the shaft down with a swinging blow
there was a sound of a heavy thud
why have you stopped shouted voices in the crowd
and mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time on the spine of the luckless mare
she sank back on her haunches but lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force tugged first on one side and then on the other trying to move the cart
but the six whips were attacking her in all directions and the shaft was raised again and fell upon her a third time then a fourth with heavy measured blows
mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow
she s a tough one was shouted in the crowd
she ll fall in a minute mates there will soon be an end of her said an admiring spectator in the crowd
stand off mikolka screamed frantically he threw down the shaft stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar
look out he shouted and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the poor mare
the blow fell the mare staggered sank back tried to pull but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back
and she fell on the ground like a log
and he leapt beside himself out of the cart
several young men also flushed with drink seized anything they could come across whips sticks poles and ran to the dying mare
mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the crowbar
the mare stretched out her head drew a long breath and died
you butchered her someone shouted in the crowd
my property shouted mikolka with bloodshot eyes brandishing the bar in his hands
he stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to beat
no mistake about it you are not a christian many voices were shouting in the crowd
but the poor boy beside himself made his way screaming through the crowd to the sorrel nag put his arms round her bleeding dead head and kissed it kissed the eyes and kissed the lips
then he jumped up and flew in a frenzy with his little fists out at mikolka
at that instant his father who had been running after him snatched him up and carried him out of the crowd
he sobbed but his voice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest
it s not our business said his father
he put his arms round his father but he felt choked choked
he tried to draw a breath to cry out and woke up
he waked up gasping for breath his hair soaked with perspiration and stood up in terror
thank god that was only a dream he said sitting down under a tree and drawing deep breaths
he felt utterly broken darkness and confusion were in his soul
he rested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands
he cried can it be can it be that i shall really take an axe that i shall strike her on the head split her skull open that i shall tread in the sticky warm blood break the lock steal and tremble hide all spattered in the blood with the axe
he was shaking like a leaf as he said this
but why am i going on like this
he continued sitting up again as it were in profound amazement
i knew that i could never bring myself to it so what have i been torturing myself for till now
yesterday yesterday when i went to make that
yesterday i realised completely that i could never bear to do it
why am i going over it again then
as i came down the stairs yesterday i said myself that it was base loathsome vile vile the very thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror
no i couldn t do it i couldn t do it
granted granted that there is no flaw in all that reasoning that all that i have concluded this last month is clear as day true as arithmetic
anyway i couldn t bring myself to it
i couldn t do it i couldn t do it
he rose to his feet looked round in wonder as though surprised at finding himself in this place and went towards the bridge
he was pale his eyes glowed he was exhausted in every limb but he seemed suddenly to breathe more easily
he felt he had cast off that fearful burden that had so long been weighing upon him and all at once there was a sense of relief and peace in his soul
lord he prayed show me my path i renounce that accursed dream of mine
crossing the bridge he gazed quietly and calmly at the neva at the glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky
in spite of his weakness he was not conscious of fatigue
it was as though an abscess that had been forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken
he was free from that spell that sorcery that obsession
later on when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during those days minute by minute point by point he was superstitiously impressed by one circumstance which though in itself not very exceptional always seemed to him afterwards the predestined of his fate
he could never understand and explain to himself why when he was tired and worn out when it would have been more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way he had returned by the hay market where he had no need to go
it was obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way though not much so
it is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without noticing what streets he passed through
but why he was always asking himself why had such an important such a decisive and at the same time such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the hay market where he had moreover no reason to go at the very hour the very minute of his life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive influence on his whole destiny
as though it had been lying in wait for him on purpose
it was about nine o clock when he crossed the hay market
at the tables and the barrows at the booths and the shops all the market people were closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their wares and like their customers were going home
rag pickers and costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty and stinking courtyards of the hay market
raskolnikov particularly liked this place and the neighbouring alleys when he wandered aimlessly in the streets
here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people
at the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out with tapes thread cotton handkerchiefs etc
they too had got up to go home but were lingering in conversation with a friend who had just come up to them
this friend was lizaveta ivanovna or as everyone called her lizaveta the younger sister of the old pawnbroker alyona ivanovna whom raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his watch and make his
he already knew all about lizaveta and she knew him a little too
she was a single woman of about tall clumsy timid submissive and almost idiotic
she was a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister who made her work day and night and even beat her
she was standing with a bundle before the huckster and his wife listening earnestly and doubtfully
they were talking of something with special warmth
the moment raskolnikov caught sight of her he was overcome by a strange sensation as it were of intense astonishment though there was nothing astonishing about this meeting
you could make up your mind for yourself lizaveta ivanovna the huckster was saying aloud
said lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully as though unable to make up her mind
upon my word what a fright you are in of alyona ivanovna gabbled the huckster s wife a lively little woman
i look at you you are like some little babe
and she is not your own sister either nothing but a and what a hand she keeps over you
but this time don t say a word to alyona ivanovna her husband interrupted that s my advice but come round to us without asking
later on your sister herself may have a notion
am i to come about seven o clock
you will be able to decide for yourself
and we ll have a cup of tea added his wife
all right i ll come said lizaveta still pondering and she began slowly moving away
raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more
he passed softly unnoticed trying not to miss a word
his first amazement was followed by a thrill of horror like a shiver running down his spine
he had learnt he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt that the next day at seven o clock lizaveta the old woman s sister and only companion would be away from home and that therefore at seven o clock precisely the old woman be left
he was only a few steps from his lodging
he went in like a man condemned to death
he thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom of thought no will and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably decided
certainly if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity he could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan than that which had just presented itself
in any case it would have been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty with greater exactness and less risk and without dangerous inquiries and investigations that next day at a certain time an old woman on whose life an attempt was contemplated would be at home and entirely alone
chapter vi later on raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his wife had invited lizaveta
it was a very ordinary matter and there was nothing exceptional about it
a family who had come to the town and been reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes all women s things
as the things would have fetched little in the market they were looking for a dealer
she undertook such jobs and was frequently employed as she was very honest and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it
she spoke as a rule little and as we have said already she was very submissive and timid
but raskolnikov had become superstitious of late
the traces of superstition remained in him long after and were almost ineradicable
and in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something strange and mysterious as it were the presence of some peculiar influences and coincidences
in the previous winter a student he knew called pokorev who had left for harkov had chanced in conversation to give him the address of alyona ivanovna the old pawnbroker in case he might want to pawn anything
for a long while he did not go to her for he had lessons and managed to get along somehow
six weeks ago he had remembered the address he had two articles that could be pawned his father s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones a present from his sister at parting
when he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her at the first glance though he knew nothing special about her
he got two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way home
he asked for tea sat down and sank into deep thought
a strange idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg and very very much absorbed him
almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student whom he did not know and had never seen and with him a young officer
they had played a game of billiards and began drinking tea
all at once he heard the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker alyona ivanovna and give him her address
this of itself seemed strange to raskolnikov he had just come from her and here at once he heard her name
of course it was a chance but he could not shake off a very extraordinary impression and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him the student began telling his friend various details about alyona ivanovna
you can always get money from her
she is as rich as a jew she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble
lots of our fellows have had dealings with her
and he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was how if you were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost how she gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven percent a month on it and so on
the student chattered on saying that she had a sister lizaveta whom the wretched little creature was continually beating and kept in complete bondage like a small child though lizaveta was at least six feet high
there s a phenomenon for you cried the student and he laughed
they began talking about lizaveta
the student spoke about her with a peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened with great interest and asked him to send lizaveta to do some mending for him
raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about her
lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her being the child of a different mother
she worked day and night for her sister and besides doing the cooking and the washing she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister all she earned
she did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind without her sister s permission
the old woman had already made her will and lizaveta knew of it and by this will she would not get a farthing nothing but the movables chairs and so on all the money was left to a monastery in the province of n that prayers might be said for her in perpetuity
lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance remarkably tall with long feet that looked as if they were bent outwards
she always wore battered goatskin shoes and was clean in her person
what the student expressed most surprise and amusement about was the fact that lizaveta was continually with child
but you say she is hideous observed the officer
yes she is so and looks like a soldier dressed up but you know she is not at all hideous
and the proof of it is that lots of people are attracted by her
she is such a soft gentle creature ready to put up with anything always willing willing to do anything
and her smile is really very sweet
you seem to find her attractive yourself laughed the officer
i could kill that damned old woman and make off with her money i assure you without the faintest the student added with warmth
the officer laughed again while raskolnikov shuddered
listen i want to ask you a serious question the student said hotly
i was joking of course but look here on one side we have a stupid senseless worthless spiteful ailing horrid old woman not simply useless but doing actual mischief who has not an idea what she is living for herself and who will die in a day or two in any case
yes yes i understand answered the officer watching his excited companion attentively
on the other side fresh young lives thrown away for want of help and by thousands on every side
a hundred thousand good deeds could be done and helped on that old woman s money which will be buried in a monastery
hundreds thousands perhaps might be set on the right path dozens of families saved from destitution from ruin from vice from the lock hospitals and all with her money
kill her take her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of humanity and the good of all
what do you think would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds
for one life thousands would be saved from corruption and decay
one death and a hundred lives in exchange it s simple arithmetic
besides what value has the life of that sickly stupid old woman in the balance of existence
no more than the life of a louse of a less in fact because the old woman is doing harm
she is wearing out the lives of others the other day she bit lizaveta s finger out of spite it almost had to be amputated
of course she does not deserve to live remarked the officer but there it is it s nature
oh well brother but we have to correct and direct nature and but for that we should drown in an ocean of prejudice
but for that there would never have been a single great man
they talk of duty conscience i don t want to say anything against duty and conscience but the point is what do we mean by them
stay i have another question to ask you
no you stay i ll ask you a question
well you are talking and speechifying away but tell me would you kill the old woman
i was only arguing the justice of it
but i think if you would not do it yourself there s no justice about it
raskolnikov was violently agitated
of course it was all ordinary youthful talk and thought such as he had often heard before in different forms and on different themes
but why had he happened to hear such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain was just conceiving
and why just at the moment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her
this coincidence always seemed strange to him
this trivial talk in a tavern had an immense influence on him in his later action as though there had really been in it something preordained some guiding hint
on returning from the hay market he flung himself on the sofa and sat for a whole hour without stirring
meanwhile it got dark he had no candle and indeed it did not occur to him to light up
he could never recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time
at last he was conscious of his former fever and shivering and he realised with relief that he could lie down on the sofa
soon heavy leaden sleep came over him as it were crushing him
he slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming
nastasya coming into his room at ten o clock the next morning had difficulty in rousing him
she brought him in tea and bread
the tea was again the second brew and again in her own
his head ached he stood up took a turn in his garret and sank back on the sofa again
going to sleep again cried nastasya
afterwards he said with an effort closing his eyes again and turning to the wall
perhaps he really is ill she said turned and went out
she came in again at two o clock with soup
nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully rousing him
she shouted looking at him with repulsion
he got up and sat down again but said nothing and stared at the floor
asked nastasya and again received no answer
you d better go out and get a breath of air she said after a pause
she remained a little longer looked at him with compassion and went out
a few minutes afterwards he raised his eyes and looked for a long while at the tea and the soup
then he took the bread took up a spoon and began to eat
he ate a little three or four spoonfuls without appetite as it were mechanically
after his meal he stretched himself on the sofa again but now he could not sleep he lay without stirring with his face in the pillow
he was haunted by and such strange in one that kept recurring he fancied that he was in africa in egypt in some sort of oasis
the caravan was resting the camels were peacefully lying down the palms stood all around in a complete circle all the party were at dinner
but he was drinking water from a spring which flowed gurgling close by
and it was so cool it was wonderful wonderful blue cold water running among the stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like gold
suddenly he heard a clock strike
he started roused himself raised his head looked out of the window and seeing how late it was suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the sofa
he crept on tiptoe to the door stealthily opened it and began listening on the staircase
but all was quiet on the stairs as if everyone was asleep
it seemed to him strange and monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the previous day and had done nothing had prepared nothing yet
and meanwhile perhaps it had struck six
and his drowsiness and stupefaction were followed by an extraordinary feverish as it were distracted haste
but the preparations to be made were few
he concentrated all his energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing and his heart kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe
first he had to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat a work of a moment
he rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away under it a worn out old unwashed shirt
from its rags he tore a long strip a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long
he folded this strip in two took off his wide strong summer overcoat of some stout cotton material his only outer garment and began sewing the two ends of the rag on the inside under the left armhole
his hands shook as he sewed but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside when he put the coat on again
the needle and thread he had got ready long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper
as for the noose it was a very ingenious device of his own the noose was intended for the axe
it was impossible for him to carry the axe through the street in his hands
and if hidden under his coat he would still have had to support it with his hand which would have been noticeable
now he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose and it would hang quietly under his arm on the inside
putting his hand in his coat pocket he could hold the end of the handle all the way so that it did not swing and as the coat was very full a regular sack in fact it could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the hand that was in the pocket
this noose too he had designed a fortnight before
when he had finished with this he thrust his hand into a little opening between his sofa and the floor fumbled in the left corner and drew out the which he had got ready long before and hidden there
this pledge was however only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and thickness of a silver cigarette case
he picked up this piece of wood in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of a workshop
afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece of iron which he had also picked up at the same time in the street
putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood he fastened them very firmly crossing and the thread round them then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it
this was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time while she was trying to undo the knot and so to gain a moment
the iron strip was added to give weight so that the woman might not guess the first minute that the thing was made of wood
all this had been stored by him beforehand under the sofa
he had only just got the pledge out when he heard someone suddenly about in the yard
he rushed to the door listened caught up his hat and began to descend his thirteen steps cautiously noiselessly like a cat
he had still the most important thing to do to steal the axe from the kitchen
that the deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago
he had also a pocket but he could not rely on the knife and still less on his own strength and so resolved finally on the axe
we may note in passing one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by him in the matter they had one strange characteristic the more final they were the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in his eyes
in spite of all his agonising inward struggle he never for a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his plans
and indeed if it had ever happened that everything to the least point could have been considered and finally settled and no uncertainty of any kind had remained he would it seems have renounced it all as something absurd monstrous and impossible
but a whole mass of unsettled points and uncertainties remained
as for getting the axe that trifling business cost him no anxiety for nothing could be easier
nastasya was continually out of the house especially in the evenings she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop and always left the door ajar
it was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her about
and so when the time came he would only have to go quietly into the kitchen and to take the axe and an hour later when everything was over go in and put it back again
supposing he returned an hour later to put it back and nastasya had come back and was on the spot
he would of course have to go by and wait till she went out again
but supposing she were in the meantime to miss the axe look for it make an outcry that would mean suspicion or at least grounds for suspicion
but those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider and indeed he had no time
he was thinking of the chief point and put off trifling details until could believe in it
but that seemed utterly unattainable
so it seemed to himself at least
he could not imagine for instance that he would sometime leave off thinking get up and simply go there
even his late experiment his visit with the object of a final survey of the place was simply an attempt at an experiment far from being the real thing as though one should say come let us go and try it why dream about it and at once he had broken down and had run away cursing in a frenzy with himself
meanwhile it would seem as regards the moral question that his analysis was complete his casuistry had become keen as a razor and he could not find rational objections in himself
but in the last resort he simply ceased to believe in himself and doggedly slavishly sought arguments in all directions fumbling for them as though someone were forcing and drawing him to it
at first long before indeed he had been much occupied with one question why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily detected and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces
he had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions and in his opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime as in the criminal himself
almost every criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a childish and phenomenal heedlessness at the very instant when prudence and caution are most essential
it was his conviction that this eclipse of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the perpetration of the crime continued with equal violence at the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time after according to the individual case and then passed off like any other disease
the question whether the disease gives rise to the crime or whether the crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of the nature of disease he did not yet feel able to decide
when he reached these conclusions he decided that in his own case there could not be such a morbid reaction that his reason and will would remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design for the simple reason that his design was not a crime
we will omit all the process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion we have run too far ahead already
we may add only that the practical purely material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his mind
one has but to keep all one s and reason to deal with them and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business
but this preparation had never been begun
his final decisions were what he came to trust least and when the hour struck it all came to pass quite differently as it were accidentally and unexpectedly
one trifling circumstance upset his calculations before he had even left the staircase
when he reached the landlady s kitchen the door of which was open as usual he glanced cautiously in to see whether in nastasya s absence the landlady herself was there or if not whether the door to her own room was closed so that she might not peep out when he went in for the axe
but what was his amazement when he suddenly saw that nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen but was occupied there taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line
seeing him she left off hanging the clothes turned to him and stared at him all the time he was passing
he turned away his eyes and walked past as though he noticed nothing
but it was the end of everything he had not the axe
what made me think he reflected as he went under the gateway what made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment
why why why did i assume this so certainly
he was crushed and even humiliated
he could have laughed at himself in his anger
a dull animal rage boiled within him
he stood hesitating in the gateway
to go into the street to go a walk for appearance sake was revolting to go back to his room even more revolting
and what a chance i have lost for ever
he muttered standing aimlessly in the gateway just opposite the porter s little dark room which was also open
from the porter s room two paces away from him something shining under the bench to the right caught his eye
he approached the room on tiptoe went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called the porter
somewhere near though in the yard for the door is wide open
he dashed to the axe it was an axe and pulled it out from under the bench where it lay between two chunks of wood at once before going out he made it fast in the noose he thrust both hands into his pockets and went out of the room no one had noticed him
when reason fails the devil helps
this chance raised his spirits extraordinarily
he walked along quietly and sedately without hurry to avoid awakening suspicion
he scarcely looked at the tried to escape looking at their faces at all and to be as little noticeable as possible
i had the money the day before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead
a curse rose from the bottom of his soul
glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop he saw by a clock on the wall that it was ten minutes past seven
he had to make haste and at the same time to go someway round so as to approach the house from the other side
when he had happened to imagine all this beforehand he had sometimes thought that he would be very much afraid
but he was not very much afraid now was not afraid at all indeed
his mind was even occupied by irrelevant matters but by nothing for long
as he passed the yusupov garden he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great fountains and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all the squares
by degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer garden were extended to the field of mars and perhaps joined to the garden of the mihailovsky palace it would be a splendid thing and a great benefit to the town
then he was interested by the question why in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity but in some peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there are no gardens nor fountains where there is most dirt and smell and all sorts of nastiness
then his own walks through the hay market came back to his mind and for a moment he waked up to reality
what nonsense he thought better think of nothing at all
so probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that meets them on the way flashed through his mind but simply flashed like lightning he made haste to dismiss this thought
and by now he was near here was the house here was the gate
suddenly a clock somewhere struck once
luckily for him everything went well again at the gates
at that very moment as though expressly for his benefit a huge waggon of hay had just driven in at the gate completely screening him as he passed under the gateway and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into the yard before he had slipped in a flash to the right
on the other side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling but no one noticed him and no one met him
many windows looking into that huge quadrangular yard were open at that moment but he did not raise his head he had not the strength to
the staircase leading to the old woman s room was close by just on the right of the gateway
drawing a breath pressing his hand against his throbbing heart and once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight he began softly and cautiously ascending the stairs listening every minute
but the stairs too were quite deserted all the doors were shut he met no one
one flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were at work in it but they did not glance at him
he stood still thought a minute and went on
of course it would be better if they had not been here but
and there was the fourth storey here was the door here was the flat opposite the empty one
the flat underneath the old woman s was apparently empty also the visiting card nailed on the door had been torn off they had gone away
for one instant the thought floated through his mind shall i go back
but he made no answer and began listening at the old woman s door a dead silence
then he listened again on the staircase listened long and intently then looked about him for the last time pulled himself together drew himself up and once more tried the axe in the noose
had i better wait a little longer till my heart leaves off thumping
but his heart did not leave off
on the contrary as though to spite him it throbbed more and more violently
he could stand it no longer he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang
half a minute later he rang again more loudly
to go on ringing was useless and out of place
the old woman was of course at home but she was suspicious and alone
he had some knowledge of her habits and once more he put his ear to the door
either his senses were peculiarly keen which it is difficult to suppose or the sound was really very distinct
anyway he suddenly heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the rustle of a skirt at the very door
someone was standing stealthily close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly listening within and seemed to have her ear to the door
he moved a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have the appearance of hiding then rang a third time but quietly soberly and without impatience recalling it afterwards that moment stood out in his mind vividly distinctly for ever he could not make out how he had had such cunning for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and he was almost unconscious of his body
an instant later he heard the latch unfastened
the door was as before opened a tiny crack and again two sharp and suspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness
then raskolnikov lost his head and nearly made a great mistake
fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone and not hoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions he took hold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from attempting to shut it again
seeing this she did not pull the door back but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with it on to the stairs
seeing that she was standing in the doorway not allowing him to pass he advanced straight upon her
she stepped back in alarm tried to say something but seemed unable to speak and stared with open eyes at him
good evening alyona ivanovna he began trying to speak easily but his voice would not obey him it broke and shook
but we d better come in to the light
and leaving her he passed straight into the room uninvited
the old woman ran after him her tongue was unloosed
why alyona ivanovna you know me
raskolnikov here i brought you the pledge i promised the other day
the old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge but at once stared in the eyes of her uninvited visitor
she looked intently maliciously and mistrustfully
a minute passed he even fancied something like a sneer in her eyes as though she had already guessed everything
he felt that he was losing his head that he was almost frightened so frightened that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half minute he thought he would have run away from her
why do you look at me as though you did not know me
he said suddenly also with malice
take it if you like if not i ll go elsewhere i am in a hurry
he had not even thought of saying this but it was suddenly said of itself
the old woman recovered herself and her visitor s resolute tone evidently restored her confidence
but why my good sir all of a minute
she asked looking at the pledge
the silver cigarette case i spoke of it last time you know
but how pale you are to be sure and your hands are trembling too
you can t help getting pale if you ve nothing to eat he added with difficulty articulating the words
his strength was failing him again
but his answer sounded like the truth the old woman took the pledge
she asked once more scanning raskolnikov intently and weighing the pledge in her hand
it does not seem somehow like silver
trying to untie the string and turning to the window to the light all her windows were shut in spite of the stifling heat she left him altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him
he unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose but did not yet take it out altogether simply holding it in his right hand under the coat
his hands were fearfully weak he felt them every moment growing more numb and more wooden
he was afraid he would let the axe slip and fall
a sudden giddiness came over him
but what has he tied it up like this for
the old woman cried with vexation and moved towards him
he had not a minute more to lose
he pulled the axe quite out swung it with both arms scarcely conscious of himself and almost without effort almost mechanically brought the blunt side down on her head
he seemed not to use his own strength in this
but as soon as he had once brought the axe down his strength returned to him
the old woman was as always bareheaded
her thin light hair streaked with grey thickly smeared with grease was plaited in a rat s tail and fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck
as she was so short the blow fell on the very top of her skull
she cried out but very faintly and suddenly sank all of a heap on the floor raising her hands to her head
in one hand she still held the pledge
then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side and on the same spot
the blood gushed as from an overturned glass the body fell back
he stepped back let it fall and at once bent over her face she was dead
her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively
he laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her pocket trying to avoid the streaming body the same pocket from which she had taken the key on his last visit
he was in full possession of his faculties free from confusion or giddiness but his hands were still trembling
he remembered afterwards that he had been particularly collected and careful trying all the time not to get smeared with blood
he pulled out the keys at once they were all as before in one bunch on a steel ring
he ran at once into the bedroom with them
it was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images
against the other wall stood a big bed very clean and covered with a silk patchwork wadded quilt
against a third wall was a chest of drawers
strange to say so soon as he began to fit the keys into the chest so soon as he heard their jingling a convulsive shudder passed over him
he suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go away
but that was only for an instant it was too late to go back
he positively smiled at himself when suddenly another terrifying idea occurred to his mind
he suddenly fancied that the old woman might be still alive and might recover her senses
leaving the keys in the chest he ran back to the body snatched up the axe and lifted it once more over the old woman but did not bring it down
there was no doubt that she was dead
bending down and examining her again more closely he saw clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side
he was about to feel it with his finger but drew back his hand and indeed it was evident without that
meanwhile there was a perfect pool of blood
all at once he noticed a string on her neck he tugged at it but the string was strong and did not snap and besides it was soaked with blood
he tried to pull it out from the front of the dress but something held it and prevented its coming
in his impatience he raised the axe again to cut the string from above on the body but did not dare and with difficulty smearing his hand and the axe in the blood after two minutes hurried effort he cut the string and took it off without touching the body with the axe he was not mistaken it was a purse
on the string were two crosses one of cyprus wood and one of copper and an image in silver filigree and with them a small greasy chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring
the purse was stuffed very full raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it flung the crosses on the old woman s body and rushed back into the bedroom this time taking the axe with him
he was in terrible haste he snatched the keys and began trying them again
they would not fit in the locks
it was not so much that his hands were shaking but that he kept making mistakes though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one and would not fit still he tried to put it in
suddenly he remembered and realised that the big key with the deep notches which was hanging there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of drawers on his last visit this had struck him but to some strong box and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box
he left the chest of drawers and at once felt under the bedstead knowing that old women usually keep boxes under their beds
and so it was there was a box under the bed at least a yard in length with an arched lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails
the notched key fitted at once and unlocked it
at the top under a white sheet was a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin under it was a silk dress then a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but clothes
the first thing he did was to wipe his hands on the red brocade
it s red and on red blood will be less noticeable the thought passed through his mind then he suddenly came to himself
good god am i going out of my senses he thought with terror
but no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from under the fur coat
he made haste to turn them all over
there turned out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes probably all pledges unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed bracelets chains pins and such things
some were in cases others simply wrapped in newspaper carefully and exactly folded and tied round with tape
without any delay he began filling up the pockets of his trousers and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases but he had not time to take many
he suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay
he stopped short and was still as death
but all was quiet so it must have been his fancy
all at once he heard distinctly a faint cry as though someone had uttered a low broken moan
then again dead silence for a minute or two
he sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited holding his breath
suddenly he jumped up seized the axe and ran out of the bedroom
in the middle of the room stood lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms
she was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister white as a sheet and seeming not to have the strength to cry out
seeing him run out of the bedroom she began faintly quivering all over like a leaf a shudder ran down her face she lifted her hand opened her mouth but still did not scream
she began slowly backing away from him into the corner staring intently persistently at him but still uttered no sound as though she could not get breath to scream
he rushed at her with the axe her mouth twitched piteously as one sees babies mouths when they begin to be frightened stare intently at what frightens them and are on the point of screaming
and this hapless lizaveta was so simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not even raise a hand to guard her face though that was the most necessary and natural action at the moment for the axe was raised over her face
she only put up her empty left hand but not to her face slowly holding it out before her as though motioning him away
the axe fell with the sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the head
raskolnikov completely lost his head snatching up her bundle dropped it again and ran into the entry
fear gained more and more mastery over him especially after this second quite unexpected murder
he longed to run away from the place as fast as possible
and if at that moment he had been capable of seeing and reasoning more correctly if he had been able to realise all the difficulties of his position the hopelessness the hideousness and the absurdity of it if he could have understood how many obstacles and perhaps crimes he had still to overcome or to commit to get out of that place and to make his way home it is very possible that he would have flung up everything and would have gone to give himself up and not from fear but from simple horror and loathing of what he had done
the feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew stronger every minute
he would not now have gone to the box or even into the room for anything in the world
but a sort of blankness even dreaminess had begun by degrees to take possession of him at moments he forgot himself or rather forgot what was of importance and caught at trifles
glancing however into the kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench he bethought him of washing his hands and the axe
his hands were sticky with blood
he dropped the axe with the blade in the water snatched a piece of soap that lay in a broken saucer on the window and began washing his hands in the bucket
when they were clean he took out the axe washed the blade and spent a long time about three minutes washing the wood where there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap
then he wiped it all with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and then he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window
there was no trace left on it only the wood was still damp
he carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat
then as far as was possible in the dim light in the kitchen he looked over his overcoat his trousers and his boots
at the first glance there seemed to be nothing but stains on the boots
he wetted the rag and rubbed the boots
but he knew he was not looking thoroughly that there might be something quite noticeable that he was overlooking
he stood in the middle of the room lost in thought
dark agonising ideas rose in his mind the idea that he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning of protecting himself that he ought perhaps to be doing something utterly different from what he was now doing
he muttered i must fly fly and he rushed into the entry
but here a shock of terror awaited him such as he had never known before
he stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes the door the outer door from the stairs at which he had not long before waited and rung was standing unfastened and at least six inches open
no lock no bolt all the time all that time
the old woman had not shut it after him perhaps as a precaution
why he had seen lizaveta afterwards
and how could he how could he have failed to reflect that she must have come in somehow
she could not have come through the wall
he dashed to the door and fastened the latch
he unfastened the latch opened the door and began listening on the staircase
somewhere far away it might be in the gateway two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting quarrelling and scolding
at last all was still as though suddenly cut off they had separated
he was meaning to go out but suddenly on the floor below a door was noisily opened and someone began going downstairs humming a tune
how is it they all make such a noise flashed through his mind
once more he closed the door and waited
at last all was still not a soul stirring
he was just taking a step towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps
the steps sounded very far off at the very bottom of the stairs but he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming to the fourth floor to the old woman
were the sounds somehow peculiar significant
the steps were heavy even and unhurried
now had passed the first floor now he was mounting higher it was growing more and more distinct
he could hear his heavy breathing
and now the third storey had been reached
and it seemed to him all at once that he was turned to stone that it was like a dream in which one is being pursued nearly caught and will be killed and is rooted to the spot and can not even move one s arms
at last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor he suddenly started and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the flat and closing the door behind him
then he took the hook and softly noiselessly fixed it in the catch
when he had done this he crouched holding his breath by the door
the unknown visitor was by now also at the door
they were now standing opposite one another as he had just before been standing with the old woman when the door divided them and he was listening
the visitor panted several times
he must be a big fat man thought raskolnikov squeezing the axe in his hand
the visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly
as soon as the tin bell tinkled raskolnikov seemed to be aware of something moving in the room
for some seconds he listened quite seriously
the unknown rang again waited and suddenly tugged violently and impatiently at the handle of the door
raskolnikov gazed in horror at the hook shaking in its fastening and in blank terror expected every minute that the fastening would be pulled out
it certainly did seem possible so violently was he shaking it
he was tempted to hold the fastening but might be aware of it
a giddiness came over him again
flashed through his mind but the unknown began to speak and he recovered himself at once
he bawled in a thick voice hey alyona ivanovna old witch
lizaveta ivanovna hey my beauty open the door
and again enraged he tugged with all his might a dozen times at the bell
he must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate acquaintance
at this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off on the stairs
raskolnikov had not heard them at first
you don t say there s no one at home the cried in a cheerful ringing voice addressing the first visitor who still went on pulling the bell
from his voice he must be quite young thought raskolnikov
i ve almost broken the lock answered koch
the day before yesterday i beat you three times running at billiards at gambrinus
where could the old woman have gone
yes and i have business with her too
and i was hoping to get some money
we must give it up of course but what did she fix this time for
the old witch fixed the time for me to come herself
and where the devil she can have got to i can t make out
she sits here from year s end to year s end the old hag her legs are bad and
yet here all of a sudden she is out for a walk
hadn t we better ask the porter
what where she s gone and when she ll be back
but you know she never does go anywhere
there s nothing to be done we must go
stay cried the young man suddenly
do you see how the door shakes if you pull it
well that shows it s not locked but fastened with the hook
do you hear how the hook clanks
that proves that one of them is at home
if they were all out they would have locked the door from the outside with the key and not with the hook from inside
there do you hear how the hook is clanking
to fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home don t you see
so there they are sitting inside and don t open the door
and he began furiously shaking the door
here you ve been ringing and pulling at the door and still they don t open
so either they ve both fainted or what
let s go fetch the porter let him wake them up
you stop here while i run down for the porter
it s evident there s something wrong here
the young man cried hotly and he ran downstairs
once more he softly touched the bell which gave one tinkle then gently as though reflecting and looking about him began touching the pulling it and letting it go to make sure once more that it was only fastened by the hook
then puffing and panting he bent down and began looking at the keyhole but the key was in the lock on the inside and so nothing could be seen
raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe
he was even making ready to fight when they should come in
while they were knocking and talking together the idea several times occurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the door
now and then he was tempted to swear at them to jeer at them while they could not open the door
was the thought that flashed through his mind
time was passing one minute and another no one came
he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his sentry duty he too went down hurrying and thumping with his heavy boots on the stairs
raskolnikov unfastened the hook opened the door there was no sound
abruptly without any thought at all he went out closing the door as thoroughly as he could and went downstairs
he had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice below where could he go
he was just going back to the flat
somebody dashed out of a flat below shouting and rather fell than ran down the stairs bawling at the top of his voice
the shout ended in a shriek the last sounds came from the yard all was still
but at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began noisily mounting the stairs
there were three or four of them
he distinguished the ringing voice of the young man
hey filled with despair he went straight to meet them feeling come what must
if they stopped him all was lost if they let him pass all was lost too they would remember him
they were approaching they were only a flight from him and suddenly deliverance
a few steps from him on the right there was an empty flat with the door wide open the flat on the second floor where the painters had been at work and which as though for his benefit they had just left
it was they no doubt who had just run down shouting
the floor had only just been painted in the middle of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes
in one instant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall and only in the nick of time they had already reached the landing
then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor talking loudly
he waited went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs
no one was on the stairs nor in the gateway
he passed quickly through the gateway and turned to the left in the street
he knew he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the flat that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked as the door had just been fastened that by now they were looking at the bodies that before another minute had passed they would guess and completely realise that the murderer had just been there and had succeeded in hiding somewhere slipping by them and escaping
they would guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat while they were going upstairs
and meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much though the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away
should he slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street
he turned down it more dead than alive
here he was half way to safety and he understood it it was less risky because there was a great crowd of people and he was lost in it like a grain of sand
but all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could scarcely move
perspiration ran down him in drops his neck was all wet
someone shouted at him when he came out on the canal bank
he was only dimly conscious of himself now and the farther he went the worse it was
he remembered however that on coming out on to the canal bank he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more conspicuous and he had thought of turning back
though he was almost falling from fatigue he went a long way round so as to get home from quite a different direction
he was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his house
he was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe
and yet he had a very grave problem before him to put it back and to escape observation as far as possible in doing so
he was of course incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to restore the axe at all but to drop it later on in somebody s yard
but it all happened fortunately the door of the porter s room was closed but not locked so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at home
but he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he walked straight to the door and opened it
if the porter had asked him what do you want
he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe
but again the porter was not at home and he succeeded in putting the axe back under the bench and even covering it with the chunk of wood as before
he met no one not a soul afterwards on the way to his room the landlady s door was shut
when he was in his room he flung himself on the sofa just as he was he did not sleep but sank into blank forgetfulness
if anyone had come into his room then he would have jumped up at once and screamed
scraps and shreds of thoughts were simply swarming in his brain but he could not catch at one he could not rest on one in spite of all his efforts
now and then he seemed to wake up and at such moments he noticed that it was far into the night but it did not occur to him to get up
at last he noticed that it was beginning to get light
he was lying on his back still dazed from his recent oblivion
fearful despairing cries rose shrilly from the street sounds which he heard every night indeed under his window after two o clock
ah the drunken men are coming out of the taverns he thought it s past two o clock and at once he leaped up as though someone had pulled him from the sofa
he sat down on the sofa and instantly recollected everything
all at once in one flash he recollected everything
for the first moment he thought he was going mad
a dreadful chill came over him but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in his sleep
now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering so that his teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking
he opened the door and began listening everything in the house was asleep
with amazement he gazed at himself and everything in the room around him wondering how he could have come in the night before without fastening the door and have flung himself on the sofa without undressing without even taking his hat off
it had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow
if anyone had come in what would he have thought
there was light enough and he began hurriedly looking himself all over from head to foot all his clothes were there no traces
but there was no doing it like that shivering with cold he began taking off everything and looking over again
he turned everything over to the last threads and rags and mistrusting himself went through his search three times
but there seemed to be nothing no trace except in one place where some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge of his trousers
he picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed threads
there seemed to be nothing more
suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of the old woman s box were still in his pockets
he had not thought till then of taking them out and hiding them
he had not even thought of them while he was examining his clothes
instantly he rushed to take them out and fling them on the table
when he had pulled out everything and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was nothing left he carried the whole heap to the corner
the paper had come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters
he began stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper they re in
all out of sight and the purse too
he thought gleefully getting up and gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever
suddenly he shuddered all over with horror my god
he whispered in despair what s the matter with me
he had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide
he had only thought of money and so had not prepared a
he thought is that hiding things
my reason s deserting me simply
he sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another unbearable fit of shivering
mechanically he drew from a chair beside him his old student s winter coat which was still warm though almost in rags covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and delirium
not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again
how could i go to sleep again with nothing done
yes yes i have not taken the loop off the armhole
i forgot it forgot a thing like that
he pulled off the noose hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits among his linen under the pillow
pieces of torn linen couldn t rouse suspicion whatever happened i think not i think not any way
he repeated standing in the middle of the room and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about him again at the floor and everywhere trying to make sure he had not forgotten anything
the conviction that all his faculties even memory and the simplest power of reflection were failing him began to be an insufferable torture
surely it isn t beginning already
surely it isn t my punishment coming upon me
the frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the floor in the middle of the room where anyone coming in would see them
he cried again like one distraught
then a strange idea entered his head that perhaps all his clothes were covered with blood that perhaps there were a great many stains but that he did not see them did not notice them because his perceptions were failing were going to pieces
suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the purse too
then there must be blood on the pocket too for i put the wet purse in my pocket
in a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and yes there were traces stains on the lining of the pocket
so my reason has not quite deserted me so i still have some sense and memory since i guessed it of myself he thought triumphantly with a deep sigh of relief it s simply the weakness of fever a moment s delirium and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his trousers
at that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot on the sock which poked out from the boot he fancied there were traces
he flung off his boots traces indeed
the tip of the sock was soaked with blood he must have unwarily stepped into that pool
but what am i to do with this now
where am i to put the sock and rags and pocket
he gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the room
but they would ransack the stove first of all
no better go out and throw it all away somewhere
yes better throw it away he repeated sitting down on the sofa again and at once this minute without lingering
but his head sank on the pillow instead
again the unbearable icy shivering came over him again he drew his coat over him
and for a long while for some hours he was haunted by the impulse to go off somewhere at once this moment and fling it all away so that it may be out of sight and done with at once at once
several times he tried to rise from the sofa but could not
he was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door
shouted nastasya banging with her fist on the door
for whole days together he s snoring here like a dog
maybe he s not at home said a man s voice
he jumped up and sat on the sofa
the beating of his heart was a positive pain
then who can have latched the door
he s taken to bolting himself in
he half rose stooped forward and unlatched the door
his room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the bed
yes the porter and nastasya were standing there
nastasya stared at him in a strange way
he glanced with a defiant and desperate air at the porter who without a word held out a grey folded paper sealed with
a notice from the office he announced as he gave him the paper
from what office a summons to the police office of course
the man looked at him attentively looked round the room and turned to go away
observed nastasya not taking her eyes off him
the porter turned his head for a moment
he s been in a fever since yesterday she added
raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands without opening it
don t you get up then nastasya went on compassionately seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa
you re ill and so don t go there s no such hurry
he looked in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his trousers the sock and the rags of the pocket
so he had been asleep with them in his hand
afterwards reflecting upon it he remembered that half waking up in his fever he had grasped all this tightly in his hand and so fallen asleep again
look at the rags he s collected and sleeps with them as though he has got hold of a treasure
and nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle
instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his eyes intently upon her
far as he was from being capable of rational reflection at that moment he felt that no one would behave like that with a person who was going to be arrested
but the police you d better have some tea
i ll bring it there s some left
no i m going i ll go at once he muttered getting on to his feet
why you ll never get downstairs
at once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags
there are stains but not very noticeable all covered with dirt and rubbed and already discoloured
no one who had no suspicion could distinguish anything
nastasya from a distance could not have noticed thank god
then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began reading he was a long while reading before he understood
it was an ordinary summons from the district to appear that day at nine at the office of the district superintendent
but when has such a thing happened
i never have anything to do with the police
he thought in agonising bewilderment
he was flinging himself on his knees to pray but broke into laughter not at the idea of prayer but at himself
if i m lost i am lost i don t care
he suddenly wondered it will get dustier still and the traces will be gone
but no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing and horror
he pulled it off but reflecting that he had no other socks he picked it up and put it on again and again he laughed
that s all conventional that s all relative merely a way of looking at it he thought in a flash but only on the top surface of his mind while he was shuddering all over there i ve got it on
i have finished by getting it on
but his laughter was quickly followed by despair
no it s too much for me he thought
his head swam and ached with fever
they want to decoy me there and confound me over everything he mused as he went out on to the stairs the worst of it is i m almost
i may blurt out something stupid
on the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as they were in the hole in the wall and very likely it s on purpose to search when i m out he thought and stopped short
but he was possessed by such despair such cynicism of misery if one may so call it that with a wave of his hand he went on
in the street the heat was insufferable again not a drop of rain had fallen all those days
again dust bricks and mortar again the stench from the shops and again the drunken men the finnish pedlars and cabs
the sun shone straight in his eyes so that it hurt him to look out of them and he felt his head going round as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the street on a bright sunny day
when he reached the turning into street in an agony of trepidation he looked down it at house and at once averted his eyes
if they question me perhaps i ll simply tell he thought as he drew near the
the was about a quarter of a mile off
it had lately been moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house
he had been once for a moment in the old office but long ago
turning in at the gateway he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with a book in his hand
a no doubt so then the office is here and he began ascending the stairs on the chance
he did not want to ask questions of anyone
i ll go in fall on my knees and confess everything he thought as he reached the fourth floor
the staircase was steep narrow and all sloppy with dirty water
the kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost the whole day
so there was a fearful smell and heat
the staircase was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their arms policemen and persons of all sorts and both sexes
the door of the office too stood wide open
there too the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms
after waiting a little he decided to move forward into the next room
a fearful impatience drew him on and on
in the second room some clerks sat writing dressed hardly better than he was and rather a set
he showed the notice he had received
the man asked glancing at the notice
the clerk looked at him but without the slightest interest
he was a particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye
there would be no getting anything out of him because he has no interest in anything thought raskolnikov
go in there to the head clerk said the clerk pointing towards the furthest room
he went into that room the fourth in order it was a small room and packed full of people rather better dressed than in the outer rooms
one poorly dressed in mourning sat at the table opposite the chief clerk writing something at his dictation
the other a very stout buxom woman with a blotchy face excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a saucer was standing on one side apparently waiting for something
raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk
the latter glanced at it said wait a minute and went on attending to the lady in mourning
by degrees he began to regain confidence he kept urging himself to have courage and be calm
some foolishness some trifling carelessness and i may betray myself
it s a pity there s no air here he added it s stifling
it makes one s head dizzier than ever and one s mind too
he was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil
he was afraid of losing his he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it something quite irrelevant but he could not succeed in this at all
yet the head clerk greatly interested him he kept hoping to see through him and guess something from his face
he was a very young man about two and twenty with a dark mobile face that looked older than his years
he was fashionably dressed and foppish with his hair parted in the middle well combed and pomaded and wore a number of rings on his fingers and a gold chain on his waistcoat
he said a couple of words in french to a foreigner who was in the room and said them fairly correctly
luise ivanovna you can sit down he said casually to the lady who was still standing as though not venturing to sit down though there was a chair beside her
ich danke said the latter and softly with a rustle of silk she sank into the chair
her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated about the table like an and filled almost half the room
but she was obviously embarrassed at filling half the room and smelling so strongly of scent and though her smile was impudent as well as cringing it betrayed evident uneasiness
the lady in mourning had done at last and got up
all at once with some noise an officer walked in very jauntily with a peculiar swing of his shoulders at each step
he tossed his cockaded cap on the table and sat down in an
the small lady positively skipped from her seat on seeing him and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy but the officer took not the smallest notice of her and she did not venture to sit down again in his presence
he was the assistant superintendent
he had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his face and extremely small features expressive of nothing much except a certain insolence
he looked askance and rather indignantly at raskolnikov he was so very badly dressed and in spite of his humiliating position his bearing was by no means in keeping with his clothes
raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on him so that he felt positively affronted
he shouted apparently astonished that such a ragged fellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance
for the recovery of money due from the head clerk interfered hurriedly tearing himself from his papers
and he flung raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place
what money thought raskolnikov but
he felt sudden intense indescribable relief
a load was lifted from his back
and pray what time were you directed to appear sir shouted the assistant superintendent seeming for some unknown reason more and more aggrieved
you are told to come at nine and now it s twelve
the notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago raskolnikov answered loudly over his shoulder
to his own surprise he too grew suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it
and it s enough that i have come here ill with fever
i m not shouting i m speaking very quietly it s you who are shouting at me
i m a student and allow no one to shout at me
the assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he could only splutter inarticulately
you re in a government office too cried raskolnikov and you re smoking a cigarette as well as shouting so you are showing disrespect to all of us
he felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this
the head clerk looked at him with a smile
the angry assistant superintendent was obviously disconcerted
he shouted at last with unnatural loudness
kindly make the declaration demanded of you
there is a complaint against you
but raskolnikov was not listening now he had eagerly clutched at the paper in haste to find an explanation
he read it once and a second time and still did not understand
it is for the recovery of money on an i o u a writ
you must either pay it with all expenses costs and so on or give a written declaration when you can pay it and at the same time an undertaking not to leave the capital without payment and nor to sell or conceal your property
the creditor is at liberty to sell your property and proceed against you according to the law
here an i o u for a hundred and fifteen roubles legally attested and due for payment has been brought us for recovery given by you to the widow of the assessor zarnitsyn nine months ago and paid over by the widow zarnitsyn to one tchebarov
we therefore summon you hereupon
and what if she is your landlady
the head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion and at the same time with a certain triumph as at a novice under fire for the first time as though he would say well how do you feel now
but what did he care now for an i o u for a writ of recovery
was that worth worrying about now was it worth attention even
he stood he read he listened he answered he even asked questions himself but all mechanically
the triumphant sense of security of deliverance from overwhelming danger that was what filled his whole soul that moment without thought for the future without analysis without suppositions or surmises without doubts and without questioning
it was an instant of full direct purely instinctive joy
but at that very moment something like a thunderstorm took place in the office
the assistant superintendent still shaken by raskolnikov s disrespect still fuming and obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity pounced on the unfortunate smart lady who had been gazing at him ever since he came in with an exceedingly silly smile
he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice
the lady in mourning had left the office
what was going on at your house last night
a disgrace again you re a scandal to the whole street
do you want the house of correction
why i have warned you ten times over that i would not let you off the eleventh
and here you are again again you you
the paper fell out of raskolnikov s hands and he looked wildly at the smart lady who was so unceremoniously treated
but he soon saw what it meant and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal
he listened with pleasure so that he longed to laugh and laugh all his nerves were on edge
the head clerk was beginning anxiously but stopped short for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not be stopped except by force
as for the smart lady at first she positively trembled before the storm
but strange to say the more numerous and violent the terms of abuse became the more amiable she looked and the more seductive the smiles she lavished on the terrible assistant
she moved uneasily and curtsied incessantly waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her word and at last she found it
there was no sort of noise or fighting in my house captain she pattered all at once like peas dropping speaking russian confidently though with a strong german accent and no sort of scandal and his honour came drunk and it s the whole truth i am telling captain and i am not to blame
mine is an honourable house captain and honourable behaviour captain and i always always dislike any scandal myself
but he came quite tipsy and asked for three bottles again and then he lifted up one leg and began playing the pianoforte with one foot and that is not at all right in an honourable house and he
broke the piano and it was very bad manners indeed
and he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it
and then i called the porter and karl came and he took karl and hit him in the eye and he hit henriette in the eye too and gave me five slaps on the cheek
and it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house captain and i screamed
and he opened the window over the canal and stood in the window squealing like a little pig it was a disgrace
the idea of squealing like a little pig at the window into the street
and karl pulled him away from the window by his coat and it is true captain he tore
and then he shouted that pay him fifteen roubles damages
and i did pay him captain five roubles for
and he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused all the scandal
i will show you up he said for i can write to all the papers about you
yes captain and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable house now then
the head clerk repeated significantly
the assistant glanced rapidly at him the head clerk slightly shook his head
so i tell you this most respectable luise ivanovna and i tell it you for the last time the assistant went on
if there is a scandal in your honourable house once again i will put you yourself in the as it is called in polite society
so a literary man an author took five roubles for his in an honourable house
and he cast a contemptuous glance at raskolnikov
there was a scandal the other day in a restaurant too
an author had eaten his dinner and would not pay i ll write a satire on you says he
and there was another of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful language to the respectable family of a civil councillor his wife and daughter
and there was one of them turned out of a confectioner s shop the other day
they are like that authors literary men students
i shall look in upon you myself one day
with hurried deference luise ivanovna fell to curtsying in all directions and so curtsied herself to the door
but at the door she stumbled backwards against a officer with a fresh open face and splendid thick fair whiskers
this was the superintendent of the district himself nikodim fomitch
luise ivanovna made haste to curtsy almost to the ground and with mincing little steps she fluttered out of the office
again thunder and lightning a hurricane said nikodim fomitch to ilya petrovitch in a civil and friendly tone
you are aroused again you are fuming again
ilya petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance and he walked with some papers to another table with a jaunty swing of his shoulders at each step
here if you will kindly look an author or a student has been one at least does not pay his debts has given an i o u won t clear out of his room and complaints are constantly being lodged against him and here he has been pleased to make a protest against my smoking in his presence
he behaves like a cad himself and just look at him please
here s the gentleman and very attractive he is
poverty is not a vice my friend but we know you go off like powder you can t bear a slight i daresay you took offence at something and went too far yourself continued nikodim fomitch turning affably to raskolnikov
but you were wrong there he is a capital fellow i assure you but explosive explosive
he gets hot fires up boils over and no stopping him
and at the bottom he s a heart of gold
his nickname in the regiment was the explosive lieutenant
and what a regiment it was too cried ilya petrovitch much gratified at this agreeable banter though still sulky
raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant to them all
excuse me captain he began easily suddenly addressing nikodim fomitch will you enter into my position
i am ready to ask pardon if i have been
i am a poor student sick and shattered shattered was the word he used by poverty
i am not studying because i can not keep myself now but i shall get money
i have a mother and sister in the province of x
they will send it to me and i will pay
my landlady is a woman but she is so exasperated at my having lost my lessons and not paying her for the last four months that she does not even send up my dinner and i don t understand this
she is asking me to pay her on this
but that is not our business you know the head clerk was observing
but allow me to explain raskolnikov put in again still addressing nikodim fomitch but trying his best to address ilya petrovitch also though the latter persistently appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously oblivious of him
allow me to explain that i have been living with her for nearly three years and at first at first for why should i not confess it at the very beginning i promised to marry her daughter it was a verbal promise freely given she was a girl indeed i liked her though i was not in love with her a youthful affair in fact that is i mean to say that my landlady gave me credit freely in those days and i led a life of
nobody asks you for these personal details sir we ve no time to waste ilya petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph but raskolnikov stopped him hotly though he suddenly found it exceedingly difficult to speak
it is for me to explain how it all happened
in my turn though i agree with you
but a year ago the girl died of typhus
i remained lodging there as before and when my landlady moved into her present quarters she said to me and in a friendly way that she had complete trust in me but still would i not give her an i o u for one hundred and fifteen roubles all the debt i owed her
she said if only i gave her that she would trust me again as much as i liked and that she would never never those were her own words make use of that
i o u till i could pay of myself and now when i have lost my lessons and have nothing to eat she takes action against me
all these affecting details are no business of ours
ilya petrovitch interrupted rudely
you must give a written undertaking but as for your love affairs and all these tragic events we have nothing to do with that
come now you are harsh muttered nikodim fomitch sitting down at the table and also beginning to write
write said the head clerk to raskolnikov
raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and contemptuously after his speech but strange to say he suddenly felt completely indifferent to anyone s opinion and this revulsion took place in a flash in one instant
if he had cared to think a little he would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like that a minute before forcing his feelings upon them
and where had those feelings come from
now if the whole room had been filled not with police officers but with those nearest and dearest to him he would not have found one human word for them so empty was his heart
a gloomy sensation of agonising everlasting solitude and remoteness took conscious form in his soul
it was not the meanness of his sentimental effusions before ilya petrovitch nor the meanness of the latter s triumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart
oh what had he to do now with his own baseness with all these petty vanities officers german women debts
if he had been sentenced to be burnt at that moment he would not have stirred would hardly have heard the sentence to the end
something was happening to him entirely new sudden and unknown
it was not that he understood but he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could never more appeal to these people in the with sentimental effusions like his recent outburst or with anything whatever and that if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any circumstance of life
he had never experienced such a strange and awful sensation
and what was most agonising it was more a sensation than a conception or idea a direct sensation the most agonising of all the sensations he had known in his life
the head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration that he could not pay that he undertook to do so at a future date that he would not leave the town nor sell his property and so on
but you can t write you can hardly hold the pen observed the head clerk looking with curiosity at raskolnikov
the head clerk took the paper and turned to attend to others
raskolnikov gave back the pen but instead of getting up and going away he put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands
he felt as if a nail were being driven into his skull
a strange idea suddenly occurred to him to get up at once to go up to nikodim fomitch and tell him everything that had happened yesterday and then to go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole in the corner
the impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat to carry it out
hadn t i better think a minute flashed through his mind
no better cast off the burden without thinking
but all at once he stood still rooted to the spot
nikodim fomitch was talking eagerly with ilya petrovitch and the words reached him it s impossible they ll both be released
to begin with the whole story contradicts itself
why should they have called the porter if it had been their doing
besides pestryakov the student was seen at the gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in
he was walking with three friends who left him only at the gate and he asked the porters to direct him in the presence of the friends
now would he have asked his way if he had been going with such an object
as for koch he spent half an hour at the silversmith s below before he went up to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight
but excuse me how do you explain this contradiction
they state themselves that they knocked and the door was locked yet three minutes later when they went up with the porter it turned out the door was unfastened
that s just it the murderer must have been there and bolted himself in and they d have caught him for a certainty if koch had not been an ass and gone to look for the porter too
must have seized the interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow
koch keeps crossing himself and saying if i had been there he would have jumped out and killed me with his axe
he is going to have a thanksgiving service ha ha
they might well not see him the house is a regular noah s ark said the head clerk who was listening
it s clear quite clear nikodim fomitch repeated warmly
no it is anything but clear ilya petrovitch maintained
raskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door but he did not reach it
when he recovered consciousness he found himself sitting in a chair supported by someone on the right side while someone else was standing on the left holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water and nikodim fomitch standing before him looking intently at him
nikodim fomitch asked rather sharply
he could hardly hold his pen when he was signing said the head clerk settling back in his place and taking up his work again
have you been ill long cried ilya petrovitch from his place where he too was looking through papers
he had of course come to look at the sick man when he fainted but retired at once when he recovered
since yesterday muttered raskolnikov in reply
short and raskolnikov white as a handkerchief had answered sharply jerkily without dropping his black feverish eyes before ilya petrovitch s stare
no matter ilya petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly
nikodim fomitch would have made some further protest but glancing at the head clerk who was looking very hard at him he did not speak
very well then concluded ilya petrovitch we will not detain you
he caught the sound of eager conversation on his departure and above the rest rose the questioning voice of nikodim fomitch
in the street his faintness passed off completely
a search there will be a search at once he repeated to himself hurrying home
his former terror mastered him completely again
and what if there has been a search already
even nastasya had not touched it
how could he have left all those things in the hole
he rushed to the corner slipped his hand under the paper pulled the things out and lined his pockets with them
there were eight articles in all two little boxes with or something of the sort he hardly looked to see then four small leather cases
there was a chain too merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper that looked like a decoration
he put them all in the different pockets of his overcoat and the remaining pocket of his trousers trying to conceal them as much as possible
then he went out of his room leaving the door open
he walked quickly and resolutely and though he felt shattered he had his senses about him
he was afraid of pursuit he was afraid that in another another quarter of an hour perhaps instructions would be issued for his pursuit and so at all costs he must hide all traces before then
he must clear everything up while he still had some strength some reasoning power left him
that had long been settled fling them into the canal and all traces hidden in the water the thing would be at an end
so he had decided in the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to get up and go away to make haste and get rid of it all
but to get rid of it turned out to be a very difficult task
he wandered along the bank of the ekaterininsky canal for half an hour or more and looked several times at the steps running down to the water but he could not think of carrying out his plan either rafts stood at the steps edge and women were washing clothes on them or boats were moored there and people were swarming everywhere
moreover he could be seen and noticed from the banks on all sides it would look suspicious for a man to go down on purpose stop and throw something into the water
and what if the boxes were to float instead of sinking
even as it was everyone he met seemed to stare and look round as if they had nothing to do but to watch him
why is it or can it be my fancy
at last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the neva
there were not so many people there he would be less observed and it would be more convenient in every way above all it was further off
he wondered how he could have been wandering for a good worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it before
and that he had lost over an irrational plan simply because he had thought of it in delirium
he had become extremely absent and forgetful and he was aware of it
he walked towards the neva along v prospect but on the way another idea struck him
would it not be better to go somewhere far off to the islands again and there hide the things in some solitary place in a wood or under a bush and mark the spot perhaps
and though he felt incapable of clear judgment the idea seemed to him a sound one
but he was not destined to go there
for coming out of v prospect towards the square he saw on the left a passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard
on the right hand the blank unwhitewashed wall of a house stretched far into the court on the left a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for twenty paces into the court and then turned sharply to the left
here was a deserted place where rubbish of different sorts was lying
at the end of the court the corner of a low smutty stone shed apparently part of some workshop peeped from behind the hoarding
it was probably a carriage builder s or carpenter s shed the whole place from the entrance was black with coal dust
here would be the place to throw it he thought
not seeing anyone in the yard he slipped in and at once saw near the gate a sink such as is often put in yards where there are many workmen or and on the hoarding above had been scribbled in chalk the witticism standing here strictly forbidden
this was all the better for there would be nothing suspicious about his going in
here i could throw it all in a heap and get away
looking round once more with his hand already in his pocket he noticed against the outer wall between the entrance and the sink a big unhewn stone weighing perhaps sixty pounds
the other side of the wall was a street
he could hear always numerous in that part but he could not be seen from the entrance unless someone came in from the street which might well happen indeed so there was need of haste
he bent down over the stone seized the top of it firmly in both hands and using all his strength turned it over
under the stone was a small hollow in the ground and he immediately emptied his pocket into it
the purse lay at the top and yet the hollow was not filled up
then he seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back so that it was in the same position again though it stood a very little higher
but he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot
then he went out and turned into the square
again an intense almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant as it had in the
and who who can think of looking under that stone
it has been lying there most likely ever since the house was built and will lie as many years more
and if it were found who would think of me
yes he remembered that he began laughing a thin nervous noiseless laugh and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square
but when he reached the k boulevard where two days before he had come upon that girl his laughter suddenly ceased
other ideas crept into his mind
he felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat on which after the girl was gone he had sat and pondered and that it would be hateful too to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had given the twenty copecks damn him
he walked looking about him angrily and distractedly
all his ideas now seemed to be circling round some single point and he felt that there really was such a point and that now now he was left facing that point and for the first time indeed during the last two months
he thought suddenly in a fit of ungovernable fury
if it has begun then it has begun
how despicably i fawned upon that wretched ilya petrovitch
what do i care for them all and my fawning upon them
suddenly he stopped a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple question perplexed and bitterly confounded him
if it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically if i really had a certain and definite object how is it i did not even glance into the purse and don t know what i had there for which i have undergone these agonies and have deliberately undertaken this base filthy degrading business
and here i wanted at once to throw into the water the purse together with all the things which i had not seen either how s that
yes that was so that was all so
yet he had known it all before and it was not a new question for him even when it was decided in the night without hesitation and consideration as though so it must be as though it could not possibly be otherwise
yes he had known it all and understood it all it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the out of it
it is because i am very ill he decided grimly at last i have been worrying and fretting myself and i don t know what i am doing
yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time i have been worrying myself
but what if i don t get well at all
good god how sick i am of it all
he had a terrible longing for some distraction but he did not know what to do what to attempt
a new overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him every moment this was an immeasurable almost physical repulsion for everything surrounding him an obstinate malignant feeling of hatred
all who met him were loathsome to him he loathed their faces their movements their gestures
if anyone had addressed him he felt that he might have spat at him or bitten him
he stopped suddenly on coming out on the bank of the little neva near the bridge to vassilyevsky ostrov
why he lives here in that house he thought why i have not come to razumihin of my own accord
here it s the same thing over again
very interesting to know though have i come on purpose or have i simply walked here by chance
never mind i said the day before yesterday that i would go and see him the day well and so i will
besides i really can not go further now
he went up to razumihin s room on the fifth floor
the latter was at home in his garret busily writing at the moment and he opened the door himself
it was four months since they had seen each other
razumihin was sitting in a ragged with slippers on his bare feet unkempt unshaven and unwashed
he looked his comrade up and down then after a brief pause he whistled
he added looking at raskolnikov s rags
come sit down you are tired i ll be bound
and when he had sunk down on the american leather sofa which was in even worse condition than his own razumihin saw at once that his visitor was ill
why you are seriously ill do you know that
raskolnikov pulled away his hand
never mind he said i have come for this i have no lessons
but i don t really want lessons
razumihin observed watching him carefully
raskolnikov got up from the sofa
as he had mounted the stairs to razumihin s he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend face to face
now in a flash he knew that what he was least of all disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the wide world
he almost choked with rage at himself as soon as he crossed razumihin s threshold
he said abruptly and walked to the door
i don t want to said the other again pulling away his hand
then why the devil have you come
well then i came to you because i know no one but you who could help to begin because you are kinder than anyone cleverer i mean and can judge and now i see that i want nothing
nothing at all no one s services no one s sympathy
i have no lessons do you see and i don t care about that but there s a bookseller heruvimov and he takes the place of a lesson
i would not exchange him for five lessons
he s doing publishing of a kind and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they have
the very titles are worth the money
you always maintained that i was a fool but by jove my boy there are greater fools than i am
now he is setting up for being advanced not that he has an inkling of anything but of course i encourage him
here are two signatures of the german text in my opinion the crudest charlatanism it discusses the question is woman a human being
and of course triumphantly proves that she is
heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a contribution to the woman question i am translating it he will expand these two and a half signatures into six we shall make up a gorgeous title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble
he pays me six roubles the signature it works out to about fifteen roubles for the job and i ve had six already in advance
when we have finished this we are going to begin a translation about whales and then some of the dullest scandals out of the second part of we have marked for translation somebody has told heruvimov that rousseau was a kind of radishchev
you may be sure i don t contradict him hang him
well would you like to do the second signature of woman a human being
if you would take the german and pens and paper all those are provided and take three roubles for as i have had six roubles in advance on the whole thing three roubles come to you for your share
and when you have finished the signature there will be another three roubles for you
and please don t think i am doing you a service quite the contrary as soon as you came in i saw how you could help me to begin with i am weak in spelling and secondly i am sometimes utterly adrift in german so that i make it up as i go along for the most part
the only comfort is that it s bound to be a change for the better
though who can tell maybe it s sometimes for the worse
raskolnikov took the german sheets in silence took the three roubles and without a word went out
razumihin gazed after him in astonishment
but when raskolnikov was in the next street he turned back mounted the stairs to razumihin s again and laying on the table the german article and the three roubles went out again still without uttering a word
razumihin shouted roused to fury at last
what did you come to see me for damn you
i don t want translation muttered raskolnikov from the stairs
then what the devil do you want shouted razumihin from above
raskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence
but raskolnikov was already stepping into the street
on the nikolaevsky bridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant incident
a coachman after shouting at him two or three times gave him a violent lash on the back with his whip for having almost fallen under his horses hoofs
the lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the railing for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle of the bridge in the traffic
he angrily clenched and ground his teeth
pretending to be drunk for sure and getting under the wheels on purpose and you have to answer for him
it s a regular profession that s what it is
but while he stood at the railing still looking angry and bewildered after the retreating carriage and rubbing his back he suddenly felt someone thrust money into his hand
it was an elderly woman in a kerchief and goatskin shoes with a girl probably her daughter wearing a hat and carrying a green parasol
take it my good man in christ s name
it was a piece of twenty copecks
from his dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar asking alms in the streets and the gift of the twenty copecks he doubtless owed to the blow which made them feel sorry for him
he closed his hand on the twenty copecks walked on for ten paces and turned facing the neva looking towards the palace
the sky was without a cloud and the water was almost bright blue which is so rare in the neva
the cupola of the cathedral which is seen at its best from the bridge about twenty paces from the chapel glittered in the sunlight and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished
the pain from the lash went off and raskolnikov forgot about it one uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely
he stood still and gazed long and intently into the distance this spot was especially familiar to him
when he was attending the university he had hundreds of times generally on his way home stood still on this spot gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him
it left him strangely cold this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless
he wondered every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and mistrusting himself put off finding the explanation of it
he vividly recalled those old doubts and perplexities and it seemed to him that it was no mere chance that he recalled them now
it struck him as strange and grotesque that he should have stopped at the same spot as before as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts be interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him
he felt it almost amusing and yet it wrung his heart
deep down hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him now all his old past his old thoughts his old problems and theories his old impressions and that picture and himself and all all
he felt as though he were flying upwards and everything were vanishing from his sight
making an unconscious movement with his hand he suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist
he opened his hand stared at the coin and with a sweep of his arm flung it into the water then he turned and went home
it seemed to him he had cut himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment
evening was coming on when he reached home so that he must have been walking about six hours
how and where he came back he did not remember
undressing and quivering like an overdriven horse he lay down on the sofa drew his greatcoat over him and at once sank into oblivion
it was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream
such unnatural sounds such howling wailing grinding tears blows and curses he had never heard
he could never have imagined such brutality such frenzy
in terror he sat up in bed almost swooning with agony
but the fighting wailing and cursing grew louder and louder
and then to his intense amazement he caught the voice of his landlady
she was howling shrieking and wailing rapidly hurriedly incoherently so that he could not make out what she was talking about she was beseeching no doubt not to be beaten for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs
the voice of her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost a croak but he too was saying something and just as quickly and indistinctly hurrying and spluttering
all at once raskolnikov trembled he recognised the voice it was the voice of ilya petrovitch
ilya petrovitch here and beating the landlady
he is kicking her banging her head against the steps that s clear that can be told from the sounds from the cries and the thuds
he could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys and all the staircases he heard voices exclamations knocking doors banging
but why why and how could it be
he repeated thinking seriously that he had gone mad
and they would come to him then next for no doubt
it s all about that about yesterday
he would have fastened his door with the latch but he could not lift his hand
terror gripped his heart like ice tortured him and numbed him
but at last all this uproar after continuing about ten minutes began gradually to subside
the landlady was moaning and groaning ilya petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses
but at last he too seemed to be silent and now he could not be heard
yes and now the landlady is going too still weeping and moaning
now the crowd was going from the stairs to their rooms exclaiming disputing calling to one another raising their voices to a shout dropping them to a whisper
there must have been numbers of them almost all the inmates of the block
raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa but could not close his eyes
he lay for half an hour in such anguish such an intolerable sensation of infinite terror as he had never experienced before
suddenly a bright light flashed into his room
nastasya came in with a candle and a plate of soup
looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not asleep she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she had brought bread salt a plate a spoon
you ve eaten nothing since yesterday i warrant
you ve been trudging about all day and you re shaking with fever
nastasya what were they beating the landlady for
just now half an hour ago ilya petrovitch the assistant superintendent on the stairs
why was he her like that and why was he here
nastasya scrutinised him silent and frowning and her scrutiny lasted a long time
he felt uneasy even frightened at her searching eyes
he said timidly at last in a weak voice
it s the blood she answered at last softly as though speaking to herself
he muttered growing white and turning towards the wall
nastasya still looked at him without speaking
nobody has been beating the landlady she declared at last in a firm resolute voice
he gazed at her hardly able to breathe
i was sitting up he said still more timidly
the assistant superintendent came
everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the flats
that s the blood crying in your ears
when there s no outlet for it and it gets clotted you begin fancying things
nastasya still stood over him watching him
give me something to drink nastasya
she went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water
he remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling some on his neck
he was not completely unconscious however all the time he was ill he was in a feverish state sometimes delirious sometimes half conscious
he remembered a great deal afterwards
sometimes it seemed as though there were a number of people round him they wanted to take him away somewhere there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about him
then he would be alone in the room they had all gone away afraid of him and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him they threatened him plotted something together laughed and mocked at him
he remembered nastasya often at his bedside he distinguished another person too whom he seemed to know very well though he could not remember who he was and this fretted him even made him cry
sometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month at other times it all seemed part of the same day
he had no recollection and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten something he ought to remember
he worried and tormented himself trying to remember moaned flew into a rage or sank into awful intolerable terror
then he struggled to get up would have run away but someone always prevented him by force and he sank back into impotence and forgetfulness
at last he returned to complete consciousness
it happened at ten o clock in the morning
on fine days the sun shone into the room at that hour throwing a streak of light on the right wall and the corner near the door
nastasya was standing beside him with another person a complete stranger who was looking at him very inquisitively
he was a young man with a beard wearing a full coat and looked like a messenger
the landlady was peeping in at the door
who is this nastasya he asked pointing to the young man
concluding that he had returned to his senses the landlady closed the door and disappeared
she was always shy and dreaded conversations or discussions
she was a woman of forty not at all fat and buxom with black eyes and eyebrows from fatness and laziness and absurdly bashful
but at that moment the door was flung open and stooping a little as he was so tall razumihin came in
i ve just heard the news from pashenka
he has just come to said nastasya
just come to echoed the man again with a smile
razumihin asked suddenly addressing him
my name is vrazumihin at your service not razumihin as i am always called but vrazumihin a student and gentleman and he is my friend
i am the messenger from our office from the merchant shelopaev and i ve come on business
razumihin seated himself on the other side of the table
it s a good thing you ve come to brother he went on to raskolnikov
for the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk anything
we had to give you tea in spoonfuls
i brought zossimov to see you twice
he examined you carefully and said at once it was nothing serious something seemed to have gone to your head
some nervous nonsense the result of bad feeding he says you have not had enough beer and radish but it s nothing much it will pass and you will be all right
come i won t keep you he said addressing the man again
you must know rodya this is the second time they have sent from the office but it was another man last time and i talked to him
that was the day before yesterday i venture to say if you please sir
that was alexey semyonovitch he is in our office too
he was more intelligent than you don t you think so
yes indeed sir he is of more weight than i am
at your mamma s request through afanasy ivanovitch vahrushin of whom i presume you have heard more than once a remittance is sent to you from our office the man began addressing raskolnikov
if you are in an intelligible condition i ve roubles to remit to you as semyon semyonovitch has received from afanasy ivanovitch at your mamma s request instructions to that effect as on previous occasions
vahrushin raskolnikov said dreamily
you hear he knows vahrushin cried razumihin
he is in an intelligible condition
and i see you are an intelligent man too
well it s always pleasant to hear words of wisdom
that s the gentleman vahrushin afanasy ivanovitch
and at the request of your mamma who has sent you a remittance once before in the same manner through him he did not refuse this time also and sent instructions to semyon semyonovitch some days since to hand you roubles in the hope of better to come
that hoping for better to come is the best thing you ve said though your mamma is not bad either
is he fully conscious eh that s all right
if only he can sign this little paper
take the pen and scribble raskolnikov for him
for just now brother money is sweeter to us than treacle
i don t want it said raskolnikov pushing away the pen
how the devil can you do without signing it
come brother that s nonsense i bear witness
don t trouble please it s only that he is on his travels again
but that s pretty common with him at all times though
you are a man of judgment and we will take him in hand that is more simply take his hand and he will sign it
now rodya don t keep your visitor you see he is waiting and he made ready to hold raskolnikov s hand in earnest
stop i ll do it alone said the latter taking the pen and signing his name
the messenger took out the money and went away
some of yesterday s answered nastasya who was still standing there
bring soup and give us some tea
raskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull unreasoning terror
he made up his mind to keep quiet and see what would happen
i believe it s reality he thought
in a couple of minutes nastasya returned with the soup and announced that the tea would be ready directly
with the soup she brought two spoons two plates salt pepper mustard for the beef and so on
the table was set as it had not been for a long time
it would not be amiss nastasya if praskovya pavlovna were to send us up a couple of bottles of beer
well you are a cool hand muttered nastasya and she departed to carry out his orders
raskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention
meanwhile razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him as clumsily as a bear put his left arm round raskolnikov s head although he was able to sit up and with his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup blowing on it that it might not burn him
but the soup was only just warm
raskolnikov swallowed one spoonful greedily then a second then a third
but after giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup razumihin suddenly stopped and said that he must ask zossimov whether he ought to have more
nastasya came in with two bottles of beer
cut along nastasya and bring some tea for tea we may venture on without the faculty
he moved back to his chair pulled the soup and meat in front of him and began eating as though he had not touched food for three days
i must tell you rodya i dine like this here every day now he mumbled with his mouth full of beef and it s all pashenka your dear little landlady who sees to that she loves to do anything for me
i don t ask for it but of course i don t object
and here s nastasya with the tea
nastasya my dear won t you have some beer
he poured out two cups left his dinner and sat on the sofa again
as before he put his left arm round the sick man s head raised him up and gave him tea in spoonfuls again blowing each spoonful steadily and earnestly as though this process was the principal and most effective means towards his friend s recovery
raskolnikov said nothing and made no resistance though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon but even perhaps could have walked about
but from some queer almost animal cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying low for a time pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession of his faculties and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on
yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance
after sipping a dozen spoonfuls of tea he suddenly released his head pushed the spoon away capriciously and sank back on the pillow
there were actually real pillows under his head now down pillows in clean cases he observed that too and took note of it
pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to make him some raspberry tea said razumihin going back to his chair and attacking his soup and beer again
and where is she to get raspberries for you asked nastasya balancing a saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of sugar
she ll get it at the shop my dear
you see rodya all sorts of things have been happening while you have been laid up
when you decamped in that rascally way without leaving your address i felt so angry that i resolved to find you out and punish you
how i ran about making inquiries for you
this lodging of yours i had forgotten though i never remembered it indeed because i did not know it and as for your old lodgings i could only remember it was at the five corners harlamov s house
i kept trying to find that harlamov s house and afterwards it turned out that it was not harlamov s but buch s
how one muddles up sound sometimes
so i lost my temper and i went on the chance to the address bureau next day and only fancy in two minutes they looked you up
i should think so and yet a general kobelev they could not find while i was there
but as soon as i did land on this place i soon got to know all your affairs all all brother i know everything nastasya here will tell you
i made the acquaintance of nikodim fomitch and ilya petrovitch and the and zametov alexandr grigorievitch the head clerk in the police office and last but not least of pashenka nastasya here knows
he s got round her nastasya murmured smiling slyly
why don t you put the sugar in your tea nastasya nikiforovna
nastasya cried suddenly going off into a giggle
i am not nikiforovna but petrovna she added suddenly recovering from her mirth
well brother to make a long story short i was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant influences in the locality but pashenka won the day
i had not expected brother to find her so prepossessing
raskolnikov did not speak but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him full of alarm
and all that could be wished indeed in every respect razumihin went on not at all embarrassed by his silence
this conversation afforded her unspeakable delight
it s a pity brother that you did not set to work in the right way at first
you ought to have approached her differently
she is so to speak a most unaccountable character
but we will talk about her character later
how could you let things come to such a pass that she gave up sending you your dinner
you must have been mad to sign an i o u
and that promise of marriage when her daughter natalya yegorovna was alive
but i see that s a delicate matter
but talking of foolishness do you know praskovya pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as you would think at first sight
no mumbled raskolnikov looking away but feeling that it was better to keep up the conversation
she isn t is she cried razumihin delighted to get an answer out of him
but she is not very clever either eh
she is essentially essentially an unaccountable character
i am sometimes quite at a loss i assure you
she must be forty she says she is and of course she has every right to say so
but i swear i judge her intellectually simply from the metaphysical point of view there is a sort of symbolism sprung up between us a sort of algebra or what not
only seeing that you are not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes and that through the young lady s death she has no need to treat you as a relation she suddenly took fright and as you hid in your den and dropped all your old relations with her she planned to get rid of you
and she s been cherishing that design a long time but was sorry to lose the i o u for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay
my mother herself is almost a beggar and i told a lie to keep my lodging and be fed raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly
but the worst of it is that at that point tchebarov turns up a business man
pashenka would never have thought of doing anything on her own account she is too retiring but the business man is by no means retiring and first thing he puts the question is there any hope of realising the i o u
answer there is because he has a mother who would save her rodya with her hundred and roubles pension if she has to starve herself and a sister too who would go into bondage for his sake
that s what he was building upon
i know all the ins and outs of your affairs now my dear boy it s not for nothing that you were so open with pashenka when you were her prospective and i say all this as a friend
but i tell you what it is an honest and sensitive man is open and a business man listens and goes on eating you up
o u by way of payment to this tchebarov and without hesitation he made a formal demand for payment
when i heard of all this i wanted to blow him up too to clear my conscience but by that time harmony reigned between me and pashenka and i insisted on stopping the whole affair engaging that you would pay
i went security for you brother
we called tchebarov flung him ten roubles and got the i o u back from him and here i have the honour of presenting it to you
here take it you see i have torn it
razumihin put the note on the table
raskolnikov looked at him and turned to the wall without uttering a word
i see brother he said a moment later that i have been playing the fool again
i thought i should amuse you with my chatter and i believe i have only made you cross
was it you i did not recognise when i was delirious
raskolnikov asked after a moment s pause without turning his head
yes and you flew into a rage about it especially when i brought zametov one day
raskolnikov turned round quickly and fixed his eyes on razumihin
he wanted to make your acquaintance because i talked to him a lot about you
how could i have found out so much except from him
he is a capital fellow brother in his own way of course
now we are friends see each other almost every day
i have moved into this part you know
i ve been with him to luise ivanovna once or twice
do you remember luise luise ivanovna
well brother now i must not lose time
he got up from the table and took up his cap
are you afraid of having let out some secret
don t worry yourself you said nothing about a countess
but you said a lot about a bulldog and about and chains and about krestovsky island and some porter and nikodim fomitch and ilya petrovitch the assistant superintendent
and another thing that was of special interest to you was your own sock
zametov hunted all about your room for your socks and with his own scented fingers he gave you the rag
and only then were you comforted and for the next hours you held the wretched thing in your hand we could not get it from you
it is most likely somewhere under your quilt at this moment
and then you asked so piteously for fringe for your trousers
we tried to find out what sort of fringe but we could not make it out
here are roubles i take ten of them and shall give you an account of them in an hour or two
i will let zossimov know at the same time though he ought to have been here long ago for it is nearly twelve
and you nastasya look in pretty often while i am away to see whether he wants a drink or anything else
and i will tell pashenka what is wanted myself
ah he s a deep one said nastasya as he went out then she opened the door and stood listening but could not resist running downstairs after him
she was very eager to hear what he would say to the landlady
she was evidently quite fascinated by razumihin
no sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman
with burning twitching impatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to work
now as though to spite him it eluded him
good god only tell me one thing do they know of it yet or not
what if they know it and are only pretending mocking me while i am laid up and then they will come in and tell me that it s been discovered long ago and that they have only
that s what i ve forgotten as though on purpose forgotten it all at once i remembered a minute ago
he stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment about him he walked to the door opened it listened but that was not what he wanted
suddenly as though recalling something he rushed to the corner where there was a hole under the paper began examining it put his hand into the hole fumbled but that was not it
he went to the stove opened it and began rummaging in the ashes the frayed edges of his trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as he had thrown them
then he remembered the sock about which razumihin had just been telling him
yes there it lay on the sofa under the quilt but it was so covered with dust and grime that zametov could not have seen anything on it
and why am i sent for to the police office
i am mixing it up that was then
i looked at my sock then too but now now i have been ill
he muttered helplessly sitting on the sofa again
am i still in delirium or is it real
ah here is my coat they passed that over
and here is money on the table thank god
and here s the i o u i ll take the money and go and take another lodging
they ll find me razumihin will find me
better escape altogether far away to america and let them do their worst
and take the i o u it would be of use there
they don t know that i can walk
i could see by their eyes that they know all about it
and what if they have set a watch there policemen
ah and here is beer left half a bottle cold
he snatched up the bottle which still contained a glassful of beer and gulped it down with relish as though quenching a flame in his breast
but in another minute the beer had gone to his head and a faint and even pleasant shiver ran down his spine
he lay down and pulled the quilt over him
his sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more disconnected and soon a light pleasant drowsiness came upon him
with a sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow wrapped more closely about him the soft wadded quilt which had replaced the old ragged greatcoat sighed softly and sank into a deep sound refreshing sleep
he woke up hearing someone come in
he opened his eyes and saw razumihin standing in the doorway uncertain whether to come in or not
raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him as though trying to recall something
razumihin shouted down the stairs
you shall have the account directly
what time is it asked raskolnikov looking round uneasily
yes you had a fine sleep brother it s almost evening it will be six o clock directly
you have slept more than six hours
i ve been waiting for the last three hours for you i ve been up twice and found you asleep
i ve called on zossimov twice not at home only fancy
and i ve been out on my own business too
you know i ve been moving moving with my uncle
i have an uncle living with me now
but that s no matter to business
and how do you feel now brother
razumihin have you been here long
i tell you i ve been waiting for the last three hours
how long have you been coming here
why i told you all about it this morning
the morning seemed like a dream to him
he could not remember alone and looked inquiringly at razumihin
hm said the latter he has forgotten
i fancied then that you were not quite yourself
now you are better for your sleep
he began untying the bundle which evidently interested him
believe me brother this is something specially near my heart
he said taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and ordinary cap
presently afterwards said raskolnikov waving it off pettishly
come rodya my boy don t oppose it afterwards will be too late and i shan t sleep all night for i bought it by guess without measure
he cried triumphantly fitting it on just your size
a proper is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in its own way
tolstyakov a friend of mine is always obliged to take off his pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other people wear their hats or caps
people think he does it from slavish politeness but it s simply because he is ashamed of his bird s nest he is such a boastful fellow
look nastasya here are two specimens of headgear this palmerston he took from the corner raskolnikov s old battered hat which for some unknown reason he called a palmerston or this jewel
guess the price rodya what do you suppose i paid for it nastasya
he said turning to her seeing that raskolnikov did not speak
twenty copecks no more i dare say answered nastasya
why nowadays you would cost more than that eighty copecks
and that only because it has been worn
and it s bought on condition that when s it s worn out they will give you another next year
well now let us pass to the united states of america as they called them at school
i assure you i am proud of these breeches and he exhibited to raskolnikov a pair of light summer trousers of grey woollen material
no holes no spots and quite respectable although a little worn and a waistcoat to match quite in the fashion
and its being worn really is an improvement it s softer smoother
you see rodya to my thinking the great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the seasons if you don t insist on having asparagus in january you keep your money in your purse and it s the same with this purchase
it s summer now so i ve been buying summer things warmer materials will be wanted for autumn so you will have to throw these away in any case especially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of coherence if not your higher standard of luxury
and remember the condition if you wear these out you will have another suit for nothing
they only do business on that system at fedyaev s if you ve bought a thing once you are satisfied for life for you will never go there again of your own free will
you see that they are a bit worn but they ll last a couple of months for it s foreign work and foreign leather the secretary of the english embassy sold them last week he had only worn them six days but he was very short of cash
but perhaps they won t fit observed nastasya
and he pulled out of his pocket raskolnikov s old broken boot stiffly coated with dry mud
i did not go they took the size from this monster
and as to your linen your landlady has seen to that
here to begin with are three shirts hempen but with a fashionable front
well now then eighty copecks the cap two roubles copecks the suit together three roubles five copecks a rouble and a half for the boots for you see they are very good and that makes four roubles copecks five roubles for the underclothes they were bought in the lot which makes exactly nine roubles copecks
and so rodya you are set up with a complete new for your overcoat will serve and even has a style of its own
that comes from getting one s clothes from sharmer s
as for your socks and other things i leave them to you we ve roubles left
and as for pashenka and paying for your lodging don t you worry
i tell you she ll trust you for anything
and now brother let me change your linen for i daresay you will throw off your illness with your shirt
he had listened with disgust to razumihin s efforts to be playful about his purchases
come brother don t tell me i ve been trudging around for nothing razumihin insisted
nastasya don t be bashful but help me that s it and in spite of raskolnikov s resistance he changed his linen
the latter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing
it will be long before i get rid of them he thought
what money was all that bought with
he asked at last gazing at the wall
why your own what the messenger brought from vahrushin your mother sent it
i remember now said raskolnikov after a long sullen silence
razumihin looked at him frowning and uneasy
the door opened and a tall stout man whose appearance seemed familiar to raskolnikov came in
chapter iv zossimov was a tall fat man with a puffy colourless face and straight flaxen hair
he wore spectacles and a big gold ring on his fat finger
he had on a light grey fashionable loose coat light summer trousers and everything about him loose fashionable and spick and span his linen was irreproachable his was massive
in manner he was slow and as it were nonchalant and at the same time studiously free and easy he made efforts to conceal his but it was apparent at every instant
all his acquaintances found him tedious but said he was clever at his work
you see he s come to himself cried razumihin
i see i see and how do we feel now eh said zossimov to raskolnikov watching him carefully and sitting down at the foot of the sofa he settled himself as comfortably as he could
he is still depressed razumihin went on
we ve just changed his linen and he almost cried
that s very natural you might have put it off if he did not wish it
raskolnikov declared positively and irritably
he raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with glittering eyes but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to the wall
going on all right he said lazily
they told him and asked what he might have
he may have anything soup tea mushrooms and cucumbers of course you must not give him he d better not have meat either and but no need to tell you that
razumihin and he looked at each other
perhaps even but never mind evening i shall take him for a walk said razumihin
we are going to the yusupov garden and then to the palais de cristal
i would not disturb him at all but i don t know a little maybe but we ll see
i ve got a party it s only a step from here
there will be a pie just our friends
and who all neighbours here almost all new friends except my old uncle and he is new too he only arrived in petersburg yesterday to see to some business of his
he s been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster gets a little pension
porfiry petrovitch the head of the investigation department here
because you quarrelled once won t you come then
well there will be some students a teacher a government clerk a musician an officer and zametov
do tell me please what you or he zossimov nodded at raskolnikov can have in common with this zametov
you are worked by principles as it were by springs you won t venture to turn round on your own account
if a man is a nice fellow that s the only principle i go upon
i don t care if he does take bribes razumihin cried with unnatural irritability
i don t praise him for taking bribes
i only say he is a nice man in his own way
but if one looks at men in all ways are there many good ones left
why i am sure i shouldn t be worth a baked onion myself perhaps with you thrown in
that s too little i d give two for you
and i wouldn t give more than one for you
i can pull his hair and one must draw him not repel him
you ll never improve a man by repelling him especially a boy
one has to be twice as careful with a boy
you harm yourselves running another man down
but if you want to know we really have something in common
we are getting him out of a mess
though indeed there s nothing to fear now
why haven t i told you about it
i only told you the beginning then about the murder of the old
well the painter is mixed up in it
oh i heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it
i read about it in the papers too
lizaveta was murdered too nastasya blurted out suddenly addressing raskolnikov
she remained in the room all the time standing by the door listening
lizaveta murmured raskolnikov hardly audibly
raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty yellow paper he picked out one clumsy white flower with brown lines on it and began examining how many petals there were in it how many scallops in the petals and how many lines on them
he felt his arms and legs as lifeless as though they had been cut off
he did not attempt to move but stared obstinately at the flower
zossimov interrupted nastasya s chatter with marked displeasure
why he was accused of the murder razumihin went on hotly
was there evidence against him then
evidence that was no evidence and that s what we have to prove
it was just as they pitched on those fellows koch and pestryakov at first
how stupidly it s all done it makes one sick though it s not one s business
by the way rodya you ve heard about the business already it happened before you were ill the day before you fainted at the police office while they were talking about it
zossimov looked curiously at raskolnikov
but i say razumihin i wonder at you
maybe i am but we will get him off anyway shouted razumihin bringing his fist down on the table
what s the most offensive is not their lying one can always forgive lying lying is a delightful thing for it leads to truth what is offensive is that they lie and worship their own lying
the door was locked and when they came back with the porter it was open
so it followed that koch and pestryakov were the murderers that was their logic
but don t excite yourself they simply detained them they could not help that
and by the way i ve met that man koch
he used to buy unredeemed pledges from the old woman
do you know what makes me angry
it s their sickening rotten petrified routine
and this case might be the means of introducing a new method
one can show from the psychological data alone how to get on the track of the real man
but facts are not everything at least half the business lies in how you interpret them
anyway one can t hold one s tongue when one has a feeling a tangible feeling that one might be a help if only
do you know the details of the case
i am waiting to hear about the painter
early on the third day after the murder when they were still dandling koch and pestryakov though they accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff an unexpected fact turned up
a peasant called dushkin who keeps a facing the house brought to the police office a jeweller s case containing some gold and told a long rigamarole
the day before yesterday just after eight o clock mark the day and the hour a journeyman nikolay who had been in to see me already that day brought me this box of gold and stones and asked me to give him two roubles for them
when i asked him where he got them he said that he picked them up in the street
i did not ask him anything more
i am telling you dushkin s story
i gave him a note a rouble that is for i thought if he did not pawn it with me he would with another
it would all come to the same thing he d spend it on drink so the thing had better be with me
the further you hide it the quicker you will find it and if anything turns up if i hear any rumours i ll take it to the police
of course that s all taradiddle he lies like a horse for i know this dushkin he is a pawnbroker and a receiver of stolen goods and he did not cheat nikolay out of a trinket in order to give it to the police
but no matter to return to dushkin s story
i ve known this peasant nikolay dementyev from a child he comes from the same province and district of zara√Øsk we are both ryazan men
and though nikolay is not a drunkard he drinks and i knew he had a job in that house painting work with dmitri who comes from the same village too
as soon as he got the rouble he changed it had a couple of glasses took his change and went out
but i did not see dmitri with him then
and the next day i heard that someone had murdered alyona ivanovna and her sister lizaveta ivanovna with an axe
i knew them and i felt suspicious about the at once for i knew the murdered woman lent money on pledges
i went to the house and began to make careful inquiries without saying a word to anyone
first of all i asked is nikolay here
dmitri told me that nikolay had gone off on the spree he had come home at daybreak drunk stayed in the house about ten minutes and went out again
dmitri didn t see him again and is finishing the job alone
and their job is on the same staircase as the murder on the second floor
when i heard all that i did not say a word to anyone that s dushkin s tale but i found out what i could about the murder and went home feeling as suspicious as ever
and at eight o clock this morning that was the third day you understand i saw nikolay coming in not sober though not to say very drunk he could understand what was said to him
he sat down on the bench and did not speak
there was only one stranger in the bar and a man i knew asleep on a bench and our two boys
have you seen dmitri said i no i haven t said he
and you ve not been here either
not since the day before yesterday said he
and where did you sleep last night
in peski with the kolomensky men
i found them in the street and the way he said it was a bit queer he did not look at me
did you hear what happened that very evening at that very hour on that same staircase said i no said he i had not heard and all the while he was listening his eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk
i told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up
wait a bit nikolay said i won t you have a drink
and i signed to the boy to hold the door and i came out from behind the bar but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run
then my doubts were at an end it was his doing as clear as could be
i should think so said zossimov
of course they sought high and low for nikolay they detained dushkin and searched his house dmitri too was arrested the kolomensky men also were turned inside out
and the day before yesterday they arrested nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town
he had gone there taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram for it
a few minutes afterwards the woman went to the cowshed and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam stood on a block of wood and was trying to put his neck in the noose
the woman screeched her hardest people ran in
take me he says to a police officer i ll confess everything
well they took him to that police station that is here with a suitable escort
so they asked him this and that how old he is and so on
at the question when you were working with dmitri didn t you see anyone on the staircase at a time answer to be sure folks may have gone up and down but i did not notice them
and didn t you hear anything any noise and so on
and did you hear nikolay that on the same day
widow and her sister were murdered and robbed
the first i heard of it was from afanasy pavlovitch the day before yesterday
why didn t you go to work with dmitri the other day
why did you run away from dushkin s
because i was awfully frightened
how could you be frightened if you felt free from guilt
now zossimov you may not believe me that question was put literally in those words
i know it for a fact it was repeated to me exactly
well anyway there s the evidence
i am not talking of the evidence now i am talking about that question of their own idea of themselves
well so they squeezed and squeezed him and he confessed i did not find it in the street but in the flat where i was painting with dmitri
why dmitri and i were painting there all day and we were just getting ready to go and dmitri took a brush and painted my face and he ran off and i after him
i ran after him shouting my hardest and at the bottom of the stairs i ran right against the porter and some gentlemen and how many gentlemen were there i don t remember
and the porter swore at me and the other porter swore too and the porter s wife came out and swore at us too and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady and he swore at us too for dmitri and i lay right across the way
i got hold of dmitri s hair and knocked him down and began beating him
and dmitri too caught me by the hair and began beating me
but we did it all not for temper but in a friendly way for sport
and then dmitri escaped and ran into the street and i ran after him but i did not catch him and went back to the flat alone i had to clear up my things
i began putting them together expecting dmitri to come and there in the passage in the corner by the door i stepped on the box
i saw it lying there wrapped up in paper
i took off the paper saw some little hooks undid them and in the box were the
raskolnikov cried suddenly staring with a blank look of terror at razumihin and he slowly sat up on the sofa leaning on his hand
razumihin too got up from his seat
nothing raskolnikov answered faintly turning to the wall
he must have waked from a dream razumihin said at last looking inquiringly at zossimov
the latter slightly shook his head
as soon as he saw the forgetting dmitri and everything he took up his cap and ran to dushkin and as we know got a rouble from him
he told a lie saying he found them in the street and went off drinking
he keeps repeating his old story about the murder i know nothing of it never heard of it till the day before yesterday
and why didn t you come to the police till now
and why did you try to hang yourself
and now what do you suppose they deduced from that
there s a clue such as it is a fact
you wouldn t have your painter set free
now they ve simply taken him for the murderer
you must admit that if on the very same day and hour from the old woman s box have come into nikolay s hands they must have come there somehow
that s a good deal in such a case
how did they get there cried razumihin
how can you a doctor whose duty it is to study man and who has more opportunity than anyone else for studying human nature how can you fail to see the character of the man in the whole story
don t you see at once that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy truth
they came into his hand precisely as he has told us he stepped on the box and picked it up
but didn t he own himself that he told a lie at first
listen to me listen attentively
the porter and koch and pestryakov and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who was sitting in the porter s lodge and the man kryukov who had just got out of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his arm that is eight or ten witnesses agree that nikolay had dmitri on the ground was lying on him beating him while dmitri hung on to his hair beating him too
they lay right across the way blocking the thoroughfare
they were sworn at on all sides while they like children the very words of the witnesses were falling over one another squealing fighting and laughing with the funniest faces and chasing one another like children they ran into the street
the bodies upstairs were warm you understand warm when they found them
if they or nikolay alone had murdered them and broken open the boxes or simply taken part in the robbery allow me to ask you one question do their state of mind their squeals and giggles and childish scuffling at the gate fit in with axes bloodshed fiendish cunning robbery
they d just killed them not five or ten minutes before for the bodies were still warm and at once leaving the flat open knowing that people would go there at once flinging away their booty they rolled about like children laughing and attracting general attention
and there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that
it s impossible indeed but no brother no
and if the being found in nikolay s hands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important piece of circumstantial evidence against him although the explanation given by him accounts for it and therefore it does not tell seriously against him one must take into consideration the facts which prove him innocent especially as they are facts that be
and do you suppose from the character of our legal system that they will accept or that they are in a position to accept this fact resting simply on a psychological impossibility as irrefutable and conclusively breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution
no they won t accept it they certainly won t because they found the and the man tried to hang himself which he could not have done if he hadn t felt guilty
that s the point that s what excites me you must understand
i forgot to ask you what proof is there that the box came from the old woman
that s been proved said razumihin with apparent reluctance frowning
koch recognised the and gave the name of the owner who proved conclusively that it was his
did anyone see nikolay at the time that koch and pestryakov were going upstairs at first and is there no evidence about that
nobody did see him razumihin answered with vexation
even koch and pestryakov did not notice them on their way upstairs though indeed their evidence could not have been worth much
they said they saw the flat was open and that there must be work going on in it but they took no special notice and could not remember whether there actually were men at work in it
so the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating one another and laughing
that constitutes a strong presumption but
how do you explain the facts yourself
at any rate the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear and the points to it
the real murderer dropped those
the murderer was upstairs locked in when koch and pestryakov knocked at the door
koch like an ass did not stay at the door so the murderer popped out and ran down too for he had no other way of escape
he hid from koch pestryakov and the porter in the flat when nikolay and dmitri had just run out of it
he stopped there while the porter and others were going upstairs waited till they were out of hearing and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when dmitri and nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry possibly he was seen but not noticed
there are lots of people going in and out
he must have dropped the out of his pocket when he stood behind the door and did not notice he dropped them because he had other things to think of
the is a conclusive proof that he did stand there
why because everything fits too well
razumihin was exclaiming but at that moment the door opened and a personage came in who was a stranger to all present
this was a gentleman no longer young of a stiff and portly appearance and a cautious and sour countenance
he began by stopping short in the doorway staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment as though asking himself what sort of place he had come to
mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost affronted he scanned raskolnikov s low and narrow cabin
with the same amazement he stared at raskolnikov who lay undressed dishevelled unwashed on his miserable dirty sofa looking fixedly at him
then with the same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth unkempt figure and unshaven face of razumihin who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the face without rising from his seat
a constrained silence lasted for a couple of minutes and then as might be expected some took place
reflecting probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs that he would get nothing in this cabin by attempting to overawe them the gentleman softened somewhat and civilly though with some severity emphasising every syllable of his question addressed zossimov rodion romanovitch raskolnikov a student or formerly a student
zossimov made a slight movement and would have answered had not razumihin anticipated him
this familiar what do you want seemed to cut the ground from the feet of the pompous gentleman
he was turning to razumihin but checked himself in time and turned to zossimov again
this is raskolnikov mumbled zossimov nodding towards him
then he gave a prolonged yawn opening his mouth as wide as possible
then he lazily put his hand into his pulled out a huge gold watch in a round hunter s case opened it looked at it and as slowly and lazily proceeded to put it back
raskolnikov himself lay without speaking on his back gazing persistently though without understanding at the stranger
now that his face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper it was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish as though he had just undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack
but the gradually began to arouse his attention then his wonder then suspicion and even alarm
when zossimov said this is raskolnikov he jumped up quickly sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant but weak and breaking voice articulated
the visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively pyotr petrovitch luzhin
i believe i have reason to hope that my name is not wholly unknown to you
but raskolnikov who had expected something quite different gazed blankly and dreamily at him making no reply as though he heard the name of pyotr petrovitch for the first time
is it possible that you can up to the present have received no information
asked pyotr petrovitch somewhat disconcerted
in reply raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow put his hands behind his head and gazed at the ceiling
a look of dismay came into luzhin s face
zossimov and razumihin stared at him more inquisitively than ever and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment
i had presumed and calculated he faltered that a letter posted more than ten days if not a fortnight ago
i say why are you standing in the doorway
if you ve something to say sit down
nastasya and you are so crowded
here s a chair thread your way in
he moved his chair back from the table made a little space between the table and his knees and waited in a rather cramped position for the visitor to thread his way in
the minute was so chosen that it was impossible to refuse and the visitor squeezed his way through hurrying and stumbling
reaching the chair he sat down looking suspiciously at razumihin
no need to be nervous the latter blurted out
rodya has been ill for the last five days and delirious for three but now he is recovering and has got an appetite
this is his doctor who has just had a look at him
i am a comrade of rodya s like him formerly a student and now i am nursing him so don t you take any notice of us but go on with your business
but shall i not disturb the invalid by my presence and conversation
pyotr petrovitch asked of zossimov
mumbled zossimov you may amuse him
he has been conscious a long time since the morning went on razumihin whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected that pyotr petrovitch began to be more cheerful partly perhaps because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a student
hm razumihin cleared his throat loudly
luzhin looked at him inquiringly
your mamma had commenced a letter to you while i was sojourning in her neighbourhood
on my arrival here i purposely allowed a few days to elapse before coming to see you in order that i might be fully assured that you were in full possession of the tidings but now to my astonishment
raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation
there was no doubt about pyotr petrovitch s being offended this time but he said nothing
he made a violent effort to understand what it all meant
meanwhile raskolnikov who had turned a little towards him when he answered began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity as though he had not had a good look at him yet or as though something new had struck him he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at him
there certainly was something peculiar in pyotr petrovitch s whole appearance something which seemed to justify the title of fianc√© so unceremoniously applied to him
in the first place it was evident far too much so indeed that pyotr petrovitch had made eager use of his few days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation of his betrothed a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding indeed
even his own perhaps too complacent consciousness of the agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such circumstances seeing that pyotr petrovitch had taken up the r√¥le of fianc√©
all his clothes were fresh from the tailor s and were all right except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate
even the stylish new round hat had the same significance
pyotr petrovitch treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands
the exquisite pair of lavender gloves real louvain told the same tale if only from the fact of his not wearing them but carrying them in his hand for show
light and youthful colours predominated in pyotr petrovitch s attire
he wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade light thin trousers a waistcoat of the same new and fine linen a cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it and the best of it was this all suited pyotr petrovitch
his very fresh and even handsome face looked younger than his years at all times
his dark whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides growing thickly upon his shining chin
even his hair touched here and there with grey though it had been combed and curled at a hairdresser s did not give him a stupid appearance as curled hair usually does by inevitably suggesting a german on his
if there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather and imposing countenance it was due to quite other causes
after scanning luzhin unceremoniously raskolnikov smiled malignantly sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as before
but luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no notice of their oddities
i feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation he began again breaking the silence with an effort
if i had been aware of your illness i should have come earlier
i have too a very important legal affair in the senate not to mention other preoccupations which you may well conjecture
i am expecting your mamma and sister any minute
raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak his face showed some excitement
pyotr petrovitch paused waited but as nothing followed he went on
i have found a lodging for them on their arrival
very near here in bakaleyev s house
that s in voskresensky put in razumihin
there are two storeys of rooms let by a merchant called yushin i ve been there
yes rooms a disgusting place filthy stinking and what s more of doubtful character
things have happened there and there are all sorts of queer people living there
and i went there about a scandalous business
i could not of course find out so much about it for i am a stranger in petersburg myself pyotr petrovitch replied huffily
however the two rooms are exceedingly clean and as it is for so short a time
i have already taken a permanent that is our future flat he said addressing raskolnikov and i am having it done up
and meanwhile i am myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov in the flat of madame lippevechsel it was he who told me of bakaleyev s house too lebeziatnikov said raskolnikov slowly as if recalling something
yes andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov a clerk in the ministry
excuse me i fancied so from your inquiry
a very nice young man and advanced
i like to meet young people one learns new things from them
luzhin looked round hopefully at them all
how do you mean asked razumihin
in the most serious and essential matters pyotr petrovitch replied as though delighted at the question
you see it s ten years since i visited petersburg
all the novelties reforms ideas have reached us in the provinces but to see it all more clearly one must be in petersburg
and it s my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the younger generation
and i confess i am delighted at what
i may be mistaken but i fancy i find clearer views more so to say criticism more practicality
practicality is a difficult thing to find it does not drop down from heaven
and for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from all practical life
ideas if you like are fermenting he said to pyotr petrovitch and desire for good exists though it s in a childish form and honesty you may find although there are crowds of brigands
i don t agree with you pyotr petrovitch replied with evident enjoyment
of course people do get carried away and make mistakes but one must have indulgence those mistakes are merely evidence of enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment
if little has been done the time has been but short of means i will not speak
it s my personal view if you care to know that something has been accomplished already
new valuable ideas new valuable works are circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors
literature is taking a maturer form many injurious prejudices have been rooted up and turned into ridicule
in a word we have cut ourselves off irrevocably from the past and that to my thinking is a great thing
he s learnt it by heart to show off
raskolnikov pronounced suddenly
what asked pyotr petrovitch not catching his words but he received no reply
that s all true zossimov hastened to interpose
pyotr petrovitch went on glancing affably at zossimov
you must admit he went on addressing razumihin with a shade of triumph and superciliousness he almost added young man that there is an advance or as they say now progress in the name of science and economic truth
hitherto for instance if i were told love thy neighbour what came of it
pyotr petrovitch went on perhaps with excessive haste
it came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both were left half naked
as a russian proverb has it catch several hares and you won t catch one
science now tells us love yourself before all men for everything in the world rests on
you love yourself and manage your own affairs properly and your coat remains whole
economic truth adds that the better private affairs are organised in society the more whole coats so to say the firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare organised too
therefore in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for myself i am acquiring so to speak for all and helping to bring to pass my neighbour s getting a little more than a torn coat and that not from private personal liberality but as a consequence of the general advance
the idea is simple but unhappily it has been a long time reaching us being hindered by idealism and sentimentality
and yet it would seem to want very little wit to perceive it
excuse me i ve very little wit myself razumihin cut in sharply and so let us drop it
i began this discussion with an object but i ve grown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse oneself of this incessant flow of commonplaces always the same that by jove i blush even when other people talk like that
you are in a hurry no doubt to exhibit your acquirements and i don t blame you that s quite pardonable
i only wanted to find out what sort of man you are for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive cause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything they touched that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire
excuse me sir said luzhin affronted and speaking with excessive dignity
do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that i too
come that s enough razumihin concluded and he turned abruptly to zossimov to continue their previous conversation
pyotr petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal
he made up his mind to take leave in another minute or two
i trust our acquaintance he said addressing raskolnikov may upon your recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware become closer
above all i hope for your return to health
raskolnikov did not even turn his head
pyotr petrovitch began getting up from his chair
one of her customers must have killed her zossimov declared positively
not a doubt of it replied razumihin
porfiry doesn t give his opinion but is examining all who have left pledges with her there
how does he get hold of them asked zossimov
koch has given the names of some of them other names are on the wrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves
it must have been a cunning and practised ruffian
that s just what it wasn t interposed razumihin
that s what throws you all off the scent
but i maintain that he is not cunning not practised and probably this was his first crime
the supposition that it was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn t work
suppose him to have been inexperienced and it s clear that it was only a chance that saved him and chance may do anything
why he did not foresee obstacles perhaps
he took jewels worth ten or twenty roubles stuffing his pockets with them ransacked the old woman s trunks her rags and they found fifteen hundred roubles besides notes in a box in the top drawer of the chest
he did not know how to rob he could only murder
it was his first crime i assure you his first crime he lost his head
and he got off more by luck than good counsel
you are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker i believe
pyotr petrovitch put in addressing zossimov
he was standing hat and gloves in hand but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more intellectual phrases
he was evidently anxious to make a favourable impression and his vanity overcame his prudence
oh yes being in the neighbourhood
i can t say that but another circumstance interests me in the case the whole question so to say
not to speak of the fact that crime has been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last five years not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere what strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes too crime is increasing proportionately
in one place one hears of a student s robbing the mail on the high road in another place people of good social position forge false banknotes in moscow of late a whole gang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets and one of the ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history then our secretary abroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain
and if this old woman the pawnbroker has been murdered by someone of a higher class in society for peasants don t pawn gold trinkets how are we to explain this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society
there are many economic changes put in zossimov
it might be explained by our inveterate impracticality
what answer had your lecturer in moscow to make to the question why he was forging notes
everybody is getting rich one way or another so i want to make haste to get rich too
i don t remember the exact words but the upshot was that he wants money for nothing without waiting or working
we ve grown used to having everything to walking on crutches to having our food chewed for us
then the great hour struck and every man showed himself in his true colours
the emancipation of the serfs in  is meant
raskolnikov interposed suddenly
it s in accordance with your theory
why carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now and it follows that people may be killed
no that s not so put in zossimov
raskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip breathing painfully
there s a measure in all things luzhin went on superciliously
economic ideas are not an incitement to murder and one has but to suppose
and is it true raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly again in a voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him is it true that you told your
within an hour of her acceptance that what pleased you most was that she was a beggar because it was better to raise a wife from poverty so that you may have complete control over her and reproach her with your being her benefactor
upon my word luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably crimson with confusion to distort my words in this way
excuse me allow me to assure you that the report which has reached you or rather let me say has been conveyed to you has no foundation in truth and i suspect who in a word this arrow
she seemed to me in other things with all her excellent qualities of a somewhat and romantic way of thinking
but i was a thousand miles from supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in so fanciful a way
and indeed indeed i tell you what cried raskolnikov raising himself on his pillow and fixing his piercing glittering eyes upon him i tell you what
luzhin stood still waiting with a defiant and offended face
silence lasted for some seconds
you dare to mention a single word about my mother
i shall send you flying downstairs
what s the matter with you cried razumihin
luzhin turned pale and bit his lip
let me tell you sir he began deliberately doing his utmost to restrain himself but breathing hard at the first moment i saw you you were to me but i remained here on purpose to find out more
i could forgive a great deal in a sick man and a connection but you never after this
but luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech squeezing between the table and the chair razumihin got up this time to let him pass
without glancing at anyone and not even nodding to zossimov who had for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone he went out lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid crushing it as he stooped to go out of the door
and even the curve of his spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received
razumihin said shaking his head in perplexity
let me alone let me alone all of you
will you ever leave off tormenting me
i am not afraid of anyone anyone now
come along said zossimov nodding to razumihin
but we can t leave him like this
come along zossimov repeated insistently and he went out
razumihin thought a minute and ran to overtake him
it might be worse not to obey him said zossimov on the stairs
if only he could get some favourable shock that s what would do it
you know he has got something on his mind
some fixed idea weighing on him
i am very much afraid so he must have
perhaps it s that gentleman pyotr petrovitch
from his conversation i gather he is going to marry his sister and that he had received a letter about it just before his illness
he may have upset the case altogether
but have you noticed he takes no interest in anything he does not respond to anything except one point on which he seems excited that s the murder
yes yes razumihin agreed i noticed that too
it gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the police office he fainted
tell me more about that this evening and i ll tell you something afterwards
in half an hour i ll go and see him again
there ll be no inflammation though
and i ll wait with pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him through nastasya
raskolnikov left alone looked with impatience and misery at nastasya but she still lingered
he turned abruptly to the wall nastasya went out
but as soon as she went out he got up latched the door undid the parcel which razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again and began dressing
strange to say he seemed immediately to have become perfectly calm not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic fear that had haunted him of late
it was the first moment of a strange sudden calm
his movements were precise and definite a firm purpose was evident in them
he understood that he was still weak but his intense spiritual concentration gave him strength and
he hoped moreover that he would not fall down in the street
when he had dressed in entirely new clothes he looked at the money lying on the table and after a moment s thought put it in his pocket
he took also all the copper change from the ten roubles spent by razumihin on the clothes
then he softly unlatched the door went out slipped downstairs and glanced in at the open kitchen door
nastasya was standing with her back to him blowing up the landlady s samovar
who would have dreamed of his going out indeed
a minute later he was in the street
it was nearly eight o clock the sun was setting
it was as stifling as before but he eagerly drank in the stinking dusty town air
his head felt rather dizzy a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his feverish eyes and his wasted pale and yellow face
he did not know and did not think where he was going he had one thought only that all must be ended once for all immediately that he would not return home without it because he not go on living like
he had not an idea about it he did not even want to think of it
he drove away thought thought tortured him
all he knew all he felt was that everything must be changed one way or another he repeated with desperate and immovable and determination
from old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the hay market
a young man with a barrel organ was standing in the road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very sentimental song
he was accompanying a girl of fifteen who stood on the pavement in front of him
she was dressed up in a crinoline a mantle and a straw hat with a feather in it all very old and shabby
in a strong and rather agreeable voice cracked and coarsened by street singing she sang in hope of getting a copper from the shop
raskolnikov joined two or three listeners took out a five copeck piece and put it in the girl s hand
she broke off abruptly on a sentimental high note shouted sharply to the organ grinder come on and both moved on to the next shop
do you like street music said raskolnikov addressing a man standing idly by him
the man looked at him startled and wondering
i love to hear singing to a street organ said raskolnikov and his manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject i like it on cold dark damp autumn evenings they must be damp when all the have pale green sickly faces or better still when wet snow is falling straight down when there s no wind you know what i mean and the street lamps shine through it
muttered the stranger frightened by the question and raskolnikov s strange manner and he crossed over to the other side of the street
raskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the hay market where the huckster and his wife had talked with lizaveta but they were not there now
recognising the place he stopped looked round and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a corn chandler s shop
isn t there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner
all sorts of people keep booths here answered the young man glancing superciliously at raskolnikov
the young man looked at raskolnikov again
it s not a province your excellency but a district
graciously forgive me your excellency
is that a tavern at the top there
yes it s an and there s a and you ll find princesses there too
in that corner there was a dense crowd of peasants
he pushed his way into the thickest part of it looking at the faces
he felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into conversation with people
but the peasants took no notice of him they were all shouting in groups together
he stood and thought a little and took a turning to the right in the direction of v
he had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle leading from the to sadovy street
of late he had often felt drawn to wander about this district when he felt depressed that he might feel more so
now he walked along thinking of nothing
at that point there is a great block of buildings entirely let out in dram shops and women were continually running in and out and in their indoor clothes
here and there they gathered in groups on the pavement especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in the lower storeys
from one of these a loud din sounds of singing the tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment floated into the street
a crowd of women were thronging round the door some were sitting on the steps others on the pavement others were standing talking
a drunken soldier smoking a cigarette was walking near them in the road swearing he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere but had forgotten where
one beggar was quarrelling with another and a man dead drunk was lying right across the road
raskolnikov joined the throng of women who were talking in husky voices
they were and wore cotton dresses and goatskin shoes
there were women of forty and some not more than seventeen almost all had blackened eyes
he felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and uproar in the saloon below
someone could be heard within dancing frantically marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air
he listened intently gloomily and dreamily bending down at the entrance and peeping inquisitively in from the pavement
oh my handsome soldier don t beat me for nothing trilled the thin voice of the singer
raskolnikov felt a great desire to make out what he was singing as though everything depended on that
her voice was still musical and less thick than the others she was young and not repulsive the only one of the group
why she s pretty he said drawing himself up and looking at her
she smiled much pleased at the compliment
you re very nice looking yourself she said
observed another woman in a deep bass
have you just come out of a hospital
they re all generals daughters it seems but they have all snub noses interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face wearing a loose coat
and he darted down into the saloon below
i say sir the girl shouted after him
i ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you kind gentleman but now i feel shy
give me six copecks for a drink there s a nice young man
raskolnikov gave her what came first fifteen copecks
well that s too much one of the women observed shaking her head at duclida
i don t know how you can ask like that
i believe i should drop with shame
raskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker
she was a wench of thirty covered with bruises with her upper lip swollen
she made her criticism quietly and earnestly
where is it thought raskolnikov
where is it i ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks an hour before his death that if he had to live on some high rock on such a narrow ledge that he d only room to stand and the ocean everlasting darkness everlasting solitude everlasting tempest around him if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his life a thousand years eternity it were better to live so than to die at once
and vile is he who calls him vile for that he added a moment later
razumihin was just talking of the palais de cristal
but what on earth was it i wanted
zossimov said he d read it in the papers
he asked going into a very spacious and positively clean restaurant consisting of several rooms which were however rather empty
two or three people were drinking tea and in a room further away were sitting four men drinking champagne
raskolnikov fancied that zametov was one of them but he could not be sure at that distance
will you have vodka asked the waiter
give me some tea and bring me the papers the old ones for the last five days and i ll give you something
the old newspapers and the tea were brought
raskolnikov sat down and began to look through them
oh damn these are the items of intelligence
an accident on a staircase spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol a fire in peski a fire in the petersburg quarter another fire in the petersburg quarter and another fire in the petersburg quarter
he found at last what he was seeking and began to read it
the lines danced before his eyes but he read it all and began eagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers
his hands shook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets
suddenly someone sat down beside him at his table
he looked up it was the head clerk zametov looking just the same with the rings on his fingers and the with the curly black hair parted and pomaded with the smart waistcoat rather shabby coat and doubtful linen
he was in a good humour at least he was smiling very gaily and
his dark face was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk
what you here he began in surprise speaking as though he d known him all his life
why razumihin told me only yesterday you were unconscious
and do you know i ve been to see you
raskolnikov knew he would come up to him
he laid aside the papers and turned to zametov
there was a smile on his lips and a new shade of irritable impatience was apparent in that smile
and you know razumihin has lost his heart to you
he says you ve been with him to luise ivanovna s you know the woman you tried to befriend for whom you winked to the explosive lieutenant and he would not understand
how could he fail to understand it was quite clear wasn t it
the explosive one no your friend razumihin
you must have a jolly life zametov entrance free to the most agreeable places
who s been pouring champagne into you just now
we ve just been having a drink together
you talk about pouring it into me
raskolnikov laughed it s all right my dear boy he added slapping zametov on the shoulder
i am not speaking from temper but in a friendly way for sport as that workman of yours said when he was scuffling with dmitri in the case of the old woman
perhaps i know more about it than you do
i am sure you are still very unwell
what are you doing reading the papers
no i am not reading about the fires
here he looked mysteriously at zametov his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile
no i am not reading about the fires he went on winking at zametov
but confess now my dear fellow you re awfully anxious to know what i am reading about
listen you are a man of culture and education
i was in the sixth class at the gymnasium said zametov with some dignity
with your parting and your rings you are a gentleman of fortune
here raskolnikov broke into a nervous laugh right in zametov s face
the latter drew back more amazed than offended
zametov repeated very seriously
i can t help thinking you are still delirious
shall i tell you what i was reading about what i was looking for
see what a lot of papers i ve made them bring me
how do you mean prick up my ears
i ll explain that afterwards but now my boy i declare to you
no that s not right either i make a deposition and you take it
i depose that i was reading that i was looking and searching
he screwed up his eyes and paused
i was searching and came here on purpose to do it for news of the murder of the old pawnbroker woman he articulated at last almost in a whisper bringing his face exceedingly close to the face of zametov
zametov looked at him steadily without moving or drawing his face away
what struck zametov afterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for exactly a minute and that they gazed at one another all the while
what if you have been reading about it
he cried at last perplexed and impatient
what of it the same old woman raskolnikov went on in the same whisper not heeding zametov s explanation about whom you were talking in the you remember when i fainted
zametov brought out almost alarmed
raskolnikov s set and earnest face was suddenly transformed and he suddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before as though utterly unable to restrain himself
and in one flash he recalled with extraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past that moment when he stood with the axe behind the door while the latch trembled and the men outside swore and shook it and he had a sudden desire to shout at them to swear at them to put out his tongue at them to mock them to laugh and laugh and laugh
you are either mad or began zametov and he broke off as though stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind
nothing said zametov getting angry it s all nonsense
after his sudden fit of laughter raskolnikov became suddenly thoughtful and melancholy
he put his elbow on the table and leaned his head on his hand
he seemed to have completely forgotten zametov
the silence lasted for some time
raskolnikov sipped the glass put a morsel of bread in his mouth and suddenly looking at zametov seemed to remember everything and pulled himself together
at the same moment his face resumed its original mocking expression
there have been a great many of these crimes lately said zametov
only the other day i read in the that a whole gang of false coiners had been caught in moscow
i read about it a month ago raskolnikov answered calmly
so you consider them criminals he added smiling
they are children simpletons not criminals
why half a hundred people meeting for such an object what an idea
three would be too many and then they want to have more faith in one another than in themselves
one has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses
they engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes what a thing to trust to a casual stranger
well let us suppose that these simpletons succeed and each makes a million and what follows for the rest of their lives
each is dependent on the others for the rest of his life
and they did not know how to change the notes either the man who changed the notes took five thousand roubles and his hands trembled
he counted the first four thousand but did not count the fifth thousand he was in such a hurry to get the money into his pocket and run away
and the whole thing came to a crash through one fool
that his hands trembled observed zametov yes that s quite possible
that i feel quite sure is possible
sometimes one can t stand things
for the sake of a hundred roubles to face such a terrible experience
to go with false notes into a bank where it s their business to spot that sort of thing
no i should not have the face to do it
raskolnikov had an intense desire again to put his tongue out
shivers kept running down his spine
i should do it quite differently raskolnikov began
this is how i would change the notes i d count the first thousand three or four times backwards and forwards looking at every note and then i d set to the second thousand i d count that through and then hold some note to the light then turn it then hold it to the light again to see whether it was a good one
i am afraid i would say a relation of mine lost roubles the other day through a false note and then i d tell them the whole story
and after i began counting the third no excuse me i would say i fancy i made a mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand i am not sure
and so i would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and so on to the end
and when i had finished i d pick out one from the fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light and ask again change them please and put the clerk into such a stew that he would not know how to get rid of me
when i d finished and had gone out i d come back no excuse me and ask for some explanation
what terrible things you say said zametov laughing
i dare say when it came to deeds you d make a slip
i believe that even a practised desperate man can not always reckon on himself much less you and i to take an example near home that old woman murdered in our district
the murderer seems to have been a desperate fellow he risked everything in open daylight was saved by a miracle but his hands shook too
he did not succeed in robbing the place he couldn t stand it
he cried maliciously gibing at zametov
do you suppose you could catch him
a great point for you is whether a man is spending money or not
if he had no money and suddenly begins spending he must be the man
so that any child can mislead you
the fact is they always do that though answered zametov
a man will commit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes drinking in a tavern
they are caught spending money they are not all as cunning as you are
you wouldn t go to a tavern of course
raskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at zametov
you seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how i should behave in that case too
i should like to zametov answered firmly and seriously
somewhat too much earnestness began to appear in his words and looks
this is how i should behave raskolnikov began again bringing his face close to zametov s again staring at him and speaking in a whisper so that the latter positively shuddered
this is what i should have done
i should have taken the money and jewels i should have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen some kitchen garden or place of that sort
i should have looked out beforehand some stone weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from the time the house was built
i would lift that stone there would sure to be a hollow under it and i would put the jewels and money in that hole
then i d roll the stone back so that it would look as before would press it down with my foot and walk away
and for a year or two three maybe i would not touch it
you are a madman said zametov and for some reason he too spoke in a whisper and moved away from raskolnikov whose eyes were glittering
he had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering
he bent down as close as possible to zametov and his lips began to move without uttering a word
this lasted for half a minute he knew what he was doing but could not restrain himself
the terrible word trembled on his lips like the latch on that door in another moment it will break out in another moment he will let it go he will speak out
and what if it was i who murdered the old woman and lizaveta
he said suddenly and realised what he had done
zametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth
his face wore a contorted smile
raskolnikov looked wrathfully at him
own up that you believed it yes you did
not a bit of it i believe it less than ever now zametov cried hastily
so you did believe it before if now you believe less than ever
not at all cried zametov obviously embarrassed
have you been frightening me so as to lead up to this
what were you talking about behind my back when i went out of the
and why did the explosive lieutenant question me after i fainted
hey there he shouted to the waiter getting up and taking his cap how much
thirty copecks the latter replied running up
and there is twenty copecks for vodka
he held out his shaking hand to zametov with notes in it
and where did my new clothes come from
you ve my landlady i ll be bound
he went out trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical sensation in which there was an element of insufferable rapture
yet he was gloomy and terribly tired
his face was twisted as after a fit
any shock any irritating sensation stimulated and revived his energies at once but his strength failed as quickly when the stimulus was removed
zametov left alone sat for a long time in the same place plunged in thought
raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on a certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively
ilya petrovitch is a blockhead he decided
raskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he stumbled against razumihin on the steps
they did not see each other till they almost knocked against each other
for a moment they stood looking each other up and down
razumihin was greatly astounded then anger real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes
he shouted at the top of his voice you ran away from your bed
and here i ve been looking for you under the sofa
i almost beat nastasya on your account
it means that i m sick to death of you all and i want to be alone raskolnikov answered calmly
when you are not able to walk when your face is as white as a sheet and you are gasping for breath
what have you been doing in the palais de cristal
let me go said raskolnikov and tried to pass him
this was too much for razumihin he gripped him firmly by the shoulder
do you know what i ll do with you directly
i ll pick you up tie you up in a bundle carry you home under my arm and lock you up
listen razumihin raskolnikov began quietly apparently calm can t you see that i don t want your benevolence
a strange desire you have to shower benefits on a man who curses them who feels them a burden in fact
why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness
i tell you plainly enough that you were torturing me that i was sick of you
you seem to want to torture people
i assure you that all that is seriously hindering my recovery because it s continually irritating me
you saw zossimov went away just now to avoid irritating me
you leave me alone too for goodness sake
what right have you indeed to keep me by force
don t you see that i am in possession of all my faculties now
how how can i persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness
i may be ungrateful i may be mean only let me be for god s sake let me be
he began calmly gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was about to utter but finished panting for breath in a frenzy as he had been with luzhin
razumihin stood a moment thought and let his hand drop
well go to hell then he said gently and thoughtfully
stay he roared as raskolnikov was about to move
let me tell you that you are all a set of babbling posing idiots
if you ve any little trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg
and you are plagiarists even in that
there isn t a sign of independent life in you
you are made of spermaceti ointment and you ve lymph in your veins instead of blood
i don t believe in anyone of you
in any circumstances the first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being
he cried with redoubled fury noticing that raskolnikov was again making a movement hear me out
you know i m having a this evening i dare say they ve arrived by now but i left my uncle there i just ran in to receive the guests
and if you weren t a fool a common fool a perfect fool if you were an original instead of a translation
you see rodya i recognise you re a clever fellow but you re a fool and if you weren t a fool you d come round to me this evening instead of wearing out your boots in the street
since you have gone out there s no help for it
i d give you a snug easy chair my landlady has one a cup of tea company
or you could lie on the sofa any way you would be with us
razumihin shouted out of patience
you don t know anything about it
thousands of times i ve fought tooth and nail with people and run back to them afterwards
one feels ashamed and goes back to a man
so remember potchinkov s house on the third storey
why razumihin i do believe you d let anybody beat you from sheer benevolence
i d twist his nose off at the mere idea
potchinkov s house  babushkin s flat
raskolnikov turned and walked away
i bet you will razumihin shouted after him
i refuse to know you if you don t
confound you don t tell me then
potchinkov s house  babushkin s flat remember
raskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into sadovy street
razumihin looked after him thoughtfully
then with a wave of his hand he went into the house but stopped short of the stairs
confound it he went on almost aloud
as if madmen didn t talk sensibly
and this was just what zossimov seemed afraid of
he struck his finger on his forehead
what if how could i let him go off alone
and he ran back to overtake raskolnikov but there was no trace of him
with a curse he returned with rapid steps to the palais de cristal to question zametov
raskolnikov walked straight to x bridge stood in the middle and leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance
on parting with razumihin he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this place
he longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street
bending over the water he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the sunset at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight at one distant attic window on the left bank flashing as though on fire in the last rays of the setting sun at the darkening water of the canal and the water seemed to catch his attention
at last red circles flashed before his eyes the houses seemed moving the the canal banks the carriages all danced before his eyes
suddenly he started saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight
he became aware of someone standing on the right side of him he looked and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head with a long yellow wasted face and red sunken eyes
she was looking straight at him but obviously she saw nothing and recognised no one
suddenly she leaned her right hand on the parapet lifted her right leg over the railing then her left and threw herself into the canal
the filthy water parted and swallowed up its victim for a moment but an instant later the drowning woman floated to the surface moving slowly with the current her head and legs in the water her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back
a woman drowning shouted dozens of voices people ran up both banks were thronged with spectators on the bridge people crowded about raskolnikov pressing up behind him
a woman cried tearfully close by
a boat a boat was shouted in the crowd
but there was no need of a boat a policeman ran down the steps to the canal threw off his great coat and his boots and rushed into the water
it was easy to reach her she floated within a couple of yards from the steps he caught hold of her clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a comrade held out to him the drowning woman was pulled out at once
they laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment
she soon recovered consciousness raised her head sat up and began sneezing and coughing stupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands
she s drunk herself out of her senses the same woman s voice wailed at her side
the other day she tried to hang herself we cut her down
i ran out to the shop just now left my little girl to look after her and here she s in trouble again
a neighbour gentleman a neighbour we live close by the second house from the end see yonder
the police still remained round the woman someone mentioned the police station
raskolnikov looked on with a strange sensation of indifference and apathy
it s not good enough he muttered to himself
nothing will come of it he added no use to wait
and why isn t zametov at the police office
the police office is open till ten o clock
he turned his back to the railing and looked about him
he said resolutely he moved from the bridge and walked in the direction of the police office
his heart felt hollow and empty
even his depression had passed there was not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out to make an end of it all
complete apathy had succeeded to it
well it s a way out of it he thought walking slowly and listlessly along the canal bank
anyway i ll make an end for i want to
there ll be the square yard of space ha
if i could find somewhere to sit or lie down soon
what i am most ashamed of is its being so stupid
but i don t care about that either
what idiotic ideas come into one s head
to reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the second turning to the left
but at the first turning he stopped and after a minute s thought turned into a side street and went two streets out of his way possibly without any object or possibly to delay a minute and gain time
he walked looking at the ground suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear he lifted his head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of house
he had not passed it he had not been near it since evening
an overwhelming unaccountable prompting drew him on
he went into the house passed through the gateway then into the first entrance on the right and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey
the narrow steep staircase was very dark
he stopped at each landing and looked round him with curiosity on the first landing the framework of the window had been taken out
here was the flat on the second storey where nikolay and dmitri had been working
it s shut up and the door newly painted
then the third storey and the fourth
he was perplexed to find the door of the flat wide open
there were men there he could hear voices he had not expected that
after brief hesitation he mounted the last stairs and went into the flat
it too was being done up there were workmen in it
this seemed to amaze him he somehow fancied that he would find everything as he left it even perhaps the corpses in the same places on the floor
and now bare walls no furniture it seemed strange
he walked to the window and sat down on the
there were two workmen both young fellows but one much younger than the other
they were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with lilac flowers instead of the old dirty yellow one
raskolnikov for some reason felt horribly annoyed by this
he looked at the new paper with dislike as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed
the workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home
they took no notice of raskolnikov s coming in they were talking
raskolnikov folded his arms and listened
she comes to me in the morning said the elder to the younger very early all dressed up
why are you preening and prinking says i
i am ready to do anything to please you tit vassilitch
and she dressed up like a regular fashion book
he obviously regarded the other as an authority
a fashion book is a lot of pictures coloured and they come to the tailors here every saturday by post from abroad to show folks how to dress the male sex as well as the female
the gentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies fluffles they re beyond anything you can fancy
there s nothing you can t find in petersburg the younger cried enthusiastically except father and mother there s everything
except them there s everything to be found my boy the elder declared sententiously
raskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box the bed and the chest of drawers had been the room seemed to him very tiny without furniture in it
the paper was the same the paper in the corner showed where the case of ikons had stood
he looked at it and went to the window
the elder workman looked at him askance
instead of answering raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the bell
the same bell the same cracked note
he rang it a second and a third time he listened and remembered
the hideous and agonisingly fearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more vividly
he shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more satisfaction
the workman shouted going out to him
it s not the time to look at rooms at night
and you ought to come up with the porter
the floors have been washed will they be painted
why the old woman and her sister were murdered here
come to the police station i ll tell you
the workmen looked at him in amazement
it s time for us to go we are late
we must lock up said the elder workman
very well come along said raskolnikov indifferently and going out first he went slowly downstairs
hey porter he cried in the gateway
at the entrance several people were standing staring at the the two porters a peasant woman a man in a long coat and a few others
raskolnikov went straight up to them
what do you want asked one of the porters
have you been to the police office
raskolnikov made no reply but stood beside them lost in thought
he s been to look at the flat said the elder workman coming forward
why have you washed away the blood says he
there has been a murder here says he and i ve come to take it
and he began ringing at the bell all but broke it
come to the police station says he
the porter looked at raskolnikov frowning and perplexed
he shouted as impressively as he could
i am rodion romanovitch raskolnikov formerly a student i live in shil s house not far from here flat number  ask the porter he knows me
raskolnikov said all this in a lazy dreamy voice not turning round but looking intently into the darkening street
take him straight to the police station the man in the long coat jerked in abruptly
raskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the same slow lazy tones come along
yes take him the man went on more confidently
why was he going into what s in his mind eh
he s not drunk but god knows what s the matter with him muttered the workman
the porter shouted again beginning to get angry in earnest why are you hanging about
you funk the police station then said raskolnikov jeeringly
why waste time talking to him cried the other porter a huge peasant in a full open coat and with keys on his belt
and seizing raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street
he lurched forward but recovered his footing looked at the spectators in silence and walked away
strange man observed the workman
there are strange folks about nowadays said the woman
you should have taken him to the police station all the same said the man in the long coat
better have nothing to do with him decided the big porter
just what he wants you may be sure but once take him up you won t get rid of him
shall i go there or not thought raskolnikov standing in the middle of the thoroughfare at the and he looked about him as though expecting from someone a decisive word
but no sound came all was dead and silent like the stones on which he walked dead to him to him alone
all at once at the end of the street two hundred yards away in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts
in the middle of the crowd stood a carriage
a light gleamed in the middle of the street
raskolnikov turned to the right and went up to the crowd
he seemed to clutch at everything and smiled coldly when he recognised it for he had fully made up his mind to go to the police station and knew that it would all soon be over
an elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of spirited grey horses there was no one in it and the coachman had got off his box and stood by the horses were being held by the bridle
a mass of people had gathered round the police standing in front
one of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying close to the wheels
everyone was talking shouting exclaiming the coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating what a misfortune
raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could and succeeded at last in seeing the object of the commotion and interest
on the ground a man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious and covered with blood he was very badly dressed but not like a workman
blood was flowing from his head and face his face was crushed mutilated and disfigured
merciful heaven wailed the coachman what more could i do
if i d been driving fast or had not shouted to him but i was going quietly not in a hurry
everyone could see i was going along just like everybody else
a drunken man can t walk straight we all know
i saw him crossing the street staggering and almost falling
i shouted again and a second and a third time then i held the horses in but he fell straight under their feet
either he did it on purpose or he was very tipsy
the horses are young and ready to take fright
they started he screamed that made them worse
that s just how it was a voice in the crowd confirmed
he shouted that s true he shouted three times another voice declared
three times it was we all heard it shouted a third
but the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened
it was evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who was awaiting it somewhere the police of course were in no little anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements
all they had to do was to take the injured man to the police station and the hospital
meanwhile raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him
the lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man s face
he shouted pushing to the front
it s a government clerk retired from the service marmeladov
he lives close by in kozel s house
he pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman
the police were glad that they had found out who the man was
raskolnikov gave his own name and address and as earnestly as if it had been his father he besought the police to carry the unconscious marmeladov to his lodging at once
just here three houses away he said eagerly the house belongs to kozel a rich german
he was going home no doubt drunk
he has a family there a wife children he has one daughter
it will take time to take him to the hospital and there is sure to be a doctor in the house
at least he will be looked after at home
but he ll die before you get him to the hospital
he managed to slip something unseen into the policeman s hand
but the thing was straightforward and legitimate and in any case help was closer here
they raised the injured man people volunteered to help
kozel s house was thirty yards away
raskolnikov walked behind carefully holding marmeladov s head and showing the way
we must take him upstairs head foremost
i ll pay i ll make it worth your while he muttered
katerina ivanovna had just begun as she always did at every free moment walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and back again with her arms folded across her chest talking to herself and coughing
of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest girl polenka a child of ten who though there was much she did not understand understood very well that her mother needed her and so always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost to appear to understand
this time polenka was undressing her little brother who had been unwell all day and was going to bed
the boy was waiting for her to take off his shirt which had to be washed at night
he was sitting straight and motionless on a chair with a silent serious face with his legs stretched out straight before him heels together and toes turned out
he was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister sitting perfectly still with pouting lips and eyes just as all good little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed
a little girl still younger dressed literally in rags stood at the screen waiting for her turn
the door on to the stairs was open to relieve them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor consumptive woman
katerina ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than ever
you wouldn t believe you can t imagine polenka she said walking about the room what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa s house and how this drunkard has brought me and will bring you all to ruin
papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor so that everyone who came to see him said we look upon you ivan mihailovitch as our governor
when i when she coughed violently oh cursed life she cried clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her breast when i when at the last ball at the marshal s
princess bezzemelny saw me who gave me the blessing when your father and i were married polenka she asked at once isn t that the pretty girl who danced the shawl dance at the
you must mend that tear you must take your needle and darn it as i showed you or cough cough cough he will make the hole bigger she articulated with effort
prince schegolskoy a kammerjunker had just come from petersburg then
he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to make me an offer next day but i thanked him in flattering expressions and told him that my heart had long been another s
that other was your father polya papa was fearfully angry
give me the shirt and the stockings
lida said she to the youngest one you must manage without your chemise and lay your stockings out with it
how is it that drunken vagabond doesn t come in
he has worn his shirt till it looks like a he has torn it to rags
i d do it all together so as not to have to work two nights running
she cried noticing a crowd in the passage and the men who were pushing into her room carrying a burden
where are we to put him asked the policeman looking round when marmeladov unconscious and covered with blood had been carried in
put him straight on the sofa with his head this way raskolnikov showed him
katerina ivanovna stood turning white and gasping for breath
little lida screamed rushed to polenka and clutched at her trembling all over
having laid marmeladov down raskolnikov flew to katerina ivanovna
for god s sake be calm don t be frightened
he said speaking quickly he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage don t be frightened he will come to i told them bring him here
i ve been here already you remember
katerina ivanovna cried despairingly and she rushed to her husband
raskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who swoon easily
she instantly placed under the luckless man s head a pillow which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining him
she kept her head forgetting herself biting her trembling lips and stifling the screams which were ready to break from her
raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor
there was a doctor it appeared next door but one
i ve sent for a doctor he kept assuring katerina ivanovna don t be uneasy i ll pay
and give me a napkin or a towel anything as quick as you can
he is injured but not killed believe me
we shall see what the doctor says
katerina ivanovna ran to the window there on a broken chair in the corner a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood in readiness for washing her children s and husband s linen that night
this washing was done by katerina ivanovna at night at least twice a week if not oftener
for the family had come to such a pass that they were practically without change of linen and katerina ivanovna could not endure uncleanliness and rather than see dirt in the house she preferred to wear herself out at night working beyond her strength when the rest were asleep so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry by the morning
she took up the basin of water at raskolnikov s request but almost fell down with her burden
but the latter had already succeeded in finding a towel wetted it and began washing the blood off marmeladov s face
katerina ivanovna stood by breathing painfully and pressing her hands to her breast
she was in need of attention herself
raskolnikov began to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man brought here
the policeman too stood in hesitation
polenka cried katerina ivanovna run to sonia make haste
if you don t find her at home leave word that her father has been run over and that she is to come here at once when she comes in
cried the little boy on the chair suddenly after which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity with round eyes his heels thrust forward and his toes spread out
meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn t have dropped a pin
the policemen left all except one who remained for a time trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs
almost all madame lippevechsel s lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms of the flat at first they were squeezed together in the doorway but afterwards they overflowed into the room
katerina ivanovna flew into a fury
you might let him die in peace at least she shouted at the crowd is it a spectacle for you to gape at
you might as well keep your hats on
you should respect the dead at least
her cough choked her but her reproaches were not without result
they evidently stood in some awe of katerina ivanovna
the lodgers one after another squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden accident even in those nearest and dearest to the victim from which no living man is exempt even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and compassion
voices outside were heard however speaking of the hospital and saying that they d no business to make a disturbance here
no business to die cried katerina ivanovna and she was rushing to the door to vent her wrath upon them but in the doorway came face to face with madame lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident and ran in to restore order
she was a particularly quarrelsome and irresponsible german
ah my god she cried clasping her hands your husband drunken horses have trampled
amalia ludwigovna i beg you to recollect what you are saying katerina ivanovna began haughtily she always took a haughty tone with the landlady that she might remember her place and even now could not deny herself this satisfaction
i have you once before told that you to call me amalia ludwigovna may not dare i am amalia ivanovna
you are not amalia ivanovna but amalia ludwigovna and as i am not one of your despicable flatterers like lebeziatnikov who s laughing behind the door at this moment a laugh and a cry of they are at it again was in fact audible at the door
so i shall always call you amalia ludwigovna though i fail to understand why you dislike that name
you can see for yourself what has happened to semyon zaharovitch he is dying
i beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one
or i warn you the himself shall be informed of your conduct
the prince knew me as a girl he remembers semyon zaharovitch well and has often been a benefactor to him
everyone knows that semyon zaharovitch had many friends and protectors whom he abandoned himself from an honourable pride knowing his unhappy weakness but now she pointed to raskolnikov a generous young man has come to our assistance who has wealth and connections and whom semyon zaharovitch has known from a child
you may rest assured amalia ludwigovna
all this was uttered with extreme rapidity getting quicker and quicker but a cough suddenly cut short katerina ivanovna s eloquence
at that instant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan she ran to him
the injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or understanding gazed at raskolnikov who was bending over him
he drew deep slow painful breaths blood oozed at the corners of his mouth and drops of perspiration came out on his forehead
not recognising raskolnikov he began looking round uneasily
katerina ivanovna looked at him with a sad but stern face and tears trickled from her eyes
how he is bleeding she said in despair
turn a little semyon zaharovitch if you can she cried to him
a priest he articulated huskily
katerina ivanovna walked to the window laid her head against the window frame and exclaimed in despair
a priest the dying man said again after a moment s silence
they ve gone for him katerina ivanovna shouted to him he obeyed her shout and was silent
with sad and timid eyes he looked for her she returned and stood by his pillow
he seemed a little easier but not for long
soon his eyes rested on little lida his favourite who was shaking in the corner as though she were in a fit and staring at him with her wondering childish eyes
what now cried katerina ivanovna
he muttered indicating with frenzied eyes the child s bare feet
be silent katerina ivanovna cried irritably you know why she is barefooted
thank god the doctor exclaimed raskolnikov relieved
the doctor came in a precise little old man a german looking about him mistrustfully he went up to the sick man took his pulse carefully felt his head and with the help of katerina ivanovna he unbuttoned the shirt and bared the injured man s chest
it was gashed crushed and fractured several ribs on the right side were broken
on the left side just over the heart was a large bruise a cruel kick from the horse s hoof
the policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and turned round with it for thirty yards on the road
it s wonderful that he has recovered consciousness the doctor whispered softly to raskolnikov
hm i could bleed him if you like but it would be useless
he is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes
but i warn you it will be perfectly useless
at that moment other steps were heard the crowd in the passage parted and the priest a little grey old man appeared in the doorway bearing the sacrament
a policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident
the doctor changed places with him exchanging glances with him
raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while
he shrugged his shoulders and remained
the dying man probably understood little he could only utter indistinct broken sounds
katerina ivanovna took little lida lifted the boy from the chair knelt down in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of her
the little girl was still trembling but the boy kneeling on his little bare knees lifted his hand rhythmically crossing himself with precision and bowed down touching the floor with his forehead which seemed to afford him especial satisfaction
katerina ivanovna bit her lips and held back her tears she prayed too now and then pulling straight the boy s shirt and managed to cover the girl s bare shoulders with a kerchief which she took from the chest without rising from her knees or ceasing to pray
meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was opened inquisitively again
in the passage the crowd of spectators from all the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser but they did not venture beyond the threshold
at that moment polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door
she came in panting from running so fast took off her kerchief looked for her mother went up to her and said she s coming i met her in the street
her mother made her kneel beside her
timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd and strange was her appearance in that room in the midst of want rags death and despair
she too was in rags her attire was all of the cheapest but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose
sonia stopped short in the doorway and looked about her bewildered unconscious of everything
she forgot her gaudy silk dress so unseemly here with its ridiculous long train and her immense crinoline that filled up the whole doorway and her shoes and the parasol she brought with her though it was no use at night and the absurd round straw hat with its flaring feather
under this hat was a pale frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in terror
sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair rather pretty with wonderful blue eyes
she looked intently at the bed and the priest she too was out of breath with running
at last whispers some words in the crowd probably reached her
she looked down and took a step forward into the room still keeping close to the door
katerina ivanovna went up to her husband again
the priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and consolation to katerina ivanovna on leaving
she interrupted sharply and irritably pointing to the little ones
god is merciful look to the most high for succour the priest began
that s a sin a sin madam observed the priest shaking his head
cried katerina ivanovna pointing to the dying man
perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to compensate you at least for the loss of his earnings
cried katerina ivanovna angrily waving her hand
and why should they compensate me
why he was drunk and threw himself under the horses
he brought us in nothing but misery
he drank everything away the drunkard
he robbed us to get drink he wasted their lives and mine for drink
you must forgive in the hour of death that s a sin madam such feelings are a great sin
katerina ivanovna was busy with the dying man she was giving him water wiping the blood and sweat from his head setting his pillow straight and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest
now she flew at him almost in a frenzy
if he d not been run over he d have come home drunk and his only shirt dirty and in rags and he d have fallen asleep like a log and i should have been sousing and rinsing till daybreak washing his rags and the children s and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight i should have been darning them
what s the use of talking of forgiveness
a terrible hollow cough interrupted her words
she put her handkerchief to her lips and showed it to the priest pressing her other hand to her aching chest
the handkerchief was covered with blood
the priest bowed his head and said nothing
marmeladov was in the last agony he did not take his eyes off the face of katerina ivanovna who was bending over him again
he kept trying to say something to her he began moving his tongue with difficulty and articulating indistinctly but katerina ivanovna understanding that he wanted to ask her forgiveness called peremptorily to him be silent
and the sick man was silent but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the doorway
till then he had not noticed her she was standing in the shadow in a corner
he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice in agitation turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his daughter was standing and trying to sit up
with unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his elbow
he looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter as though not recognising her
he had never seen her before in such attire
suddenly he recognised her crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and gaudy finery meekly awaiting her turn to say to her dying father
his face showed intense suffering
he cried and he tried to hold out his hand to her but losing his balance he fell off the sofa face downwards on the floor
they rushed to pick him up they put him on the sofa but he was dying
sonia with a faint cry ran up embraced him and remained so without moving
he s got what he wanted katerina ivanovna cried seeing her husband s dead body
raskolnikov went up to katerina ivanovna
katerina ivanovna he began last week your husband told me all his life and circumstances
believe me he spoke of you with passionate reverence
from that evening when i learnt how devoted he was to you all and how he loved and respected you especially katerina ivanovna in spite of his unfortunate weakness from that evening we became friends
allow me now to do something to repay my debt to my dead friend
here are twenty roubles i think and if that can be of any assistance to you then
i in short i will come again i will be sure to come again
and he went quickly out of the room squeezing his way through the crowd to the stairs
but in the crowd he suddenly jostled against nikodim fomitch who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions in person
they had not met since the scene at the police station but nikodim fomitch knew him instantly
the doctor and the priest have been all as it should have been
don t worry the poor woman too much she is in consumption as it is
try and cheer her up if possible
you are a man i know he added with a smile looking straight in his face
but you are spattered with blood observed nikodim fomitch noticing in the lamplight some fresh stains on raskolnikov s waistcoat
yes i m covered with blood raskolnikov said with a peculiar air then he smiled nodded and went downstairs
he walked down slowly and deliberately feverish but not conscious of it entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and strength that surged up suddenly within him
this sensation might be compared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been pardoned
halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on his way home raskolnikov let him pass exchanging a silent greeting with him
he was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid footsteps behind him
someone overtook him it was polenka
she was running after him calling wait wait
she was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped short a step above him
a dim light came in from the yard
raskolnikov could distinguish the child s thin but pretty little face looking at him with a bright childish smile
she had run after him with a message which she was evidently glad to give
tell me what is your name and where do you live
she said hurriedly in a breathless voice
he laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of rapture
it was such a joy to him to look at her he could not have said why
sister sonia sent me answered the girl smiling still more brightly
i knew it was sister sonia sent you
mamma sent me too when sister sonia was sending me mamma came up too and said run fast polenka
i love her more than anyone polenka answered with a peculiar earnestness and her smile became graver
by way of answer he saw the little girl s face approaching him her full lips na√Øvely held out to kiss him
suddenly her arms as thin as sticks held him tightly her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl wept softly pressing her face against him
i am sorry for father she said a moment later raising her face and brushing away the tears with her hands
it s nothing but misfortunes now she added suddenly with that peculiarly sedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak like people
he loved lida most she went on very seriously without a smile exactly like people he loved her because she is little and because she is ill too
and he always used to bring her presents
but he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture too she added with dignity
and mother never used to say anything but we knew that she liked it and father knew it too
and mother wants to teach me french for it s time my education began
i say my prayers to myself as i am a big girl now but kolya and lida say them aloud with mother
first they repeat the ave maria and then another prayer lord forgive and bless sister sonia and then another lord forgive and bless our second father
for our elder father is dead and this is another one but we do pray for the other as well
and thy servant rodion nothing more
i ll pray for you all the rest of my life the little girl declared hotly and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him warmly once more
raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to come next day
the child went away quite enchanted with him
it was past ten when he came out into the street
in five minutes he was standing on the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in
enough he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly
i ve done with fancies imaginary terrors and phantoms
my life has not yet died with that old woman
the kingdom of heaven to her and now enough madam leave me in peace
now for the reign of reason and light and of will and of strength and now we will see
he added defiantly as though challenging some power of darkness
and i was ready to consent to live in a square of space
i am very weak at this moment but
i believe my illness is all over
i knew it would be over when i went out
by the way potchinkov s house is only a few steps away
i certainly must go to razumihin even if it were not close by let him win his bet
let us give him some satisfaction too no matter
strength strength is what one wants you can get nothing without it and strength must be won by strength that s what they don t know he added proudly and and he walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge
pride and grew continually stronger in him he was becoming a different man every moment
what was it had happened to work this revolution in him
he did not know himself like a man catching at a straw he suddenly felt that he too could live that there was still life for him that his life had not died with the old woman
perhaps he was in too great a hurry with his conclusions but he did not think of that
but i did ask her to remember thy servant rodion in her prayers the idea struck him
well that was in case of emergency he added and laughed himself at his boyish sally
he easily found razumihin the new lodger was already known at potchinkov s and the porter at once showed him the way
upstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big gathering of people
the door was wide open on the stairs he could hear exclamations and discussion
razumihin s room was fairly large the company consisted of fifteen people
raskolnikov stopped in the entry where two of the landlady s servants were busy behind a screen with two samovars bottles plates and dishes of pie and savouries brought up from the landlady s kitchen
raskolnikov sent in for razumihin
at the first glance it was apparent that he had had a great deal to drink and though no amount of liquor made razumihin quite drunk this time he was perceptibly affected by it
listen raskolnikov hastened to say i ve only just come to tell you you ve won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to him
i can t come in i am so weak that i shall fall down directly
if you say you re weak yourself you must
who is the one who has just peeped out
some friend of uncle s i expect or perhaps he has come without being invited
i ll leave uncle with them he is an invaluable person pity i can t introduce you to him now
they won t notice me and i need a little fresh air for you ve come just in the nick of time another two minutes and i should have come to blows
they are talking such a lot of wild stuff
you simply can t imagine what men will say
though why shouldn t you imagine
don t we talk nonsense ourselves
and let them that s the way to learn not to
wait a minute i ll fetch zossimov
zossimov pounced upon raskolnikov almost greedily he showed a special interest in him soon his face brightened
you must go to bed at once he pronounced examining the patient as far as he could and take something for the night
i got it ready some time ago a powder
two if you like answered raskolnikov
it s a good thing you are taking him home observed zossimov to razumihin we shall see how he is he s not at all amiss a considerable change since the afternoon
do you know what zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out
razumihin blurted out as soon as they were in the street
i won t tell you everything brother because they are such fools
zossimov told me to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me and afterwards i am to tell him about it for he s got a notion in his head that you are mad or close on it
in the first place you ve three times the brains he has in the second if you are not mad you needn t care a hang that he has got such a wild idea and thirdly that piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental diseases and what s brought him to this conclusion about you was your conversation with zametov
now i understand what it all means and so does zametov
well the fact is rodya the point is
no matter the point is that this idea
was just being hatched in their brains
that is no one ventured to say it aloud because the idea is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter that bubble s burst and gone for ever
i gave zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time that s between ourselves brother please don t let out a hint that you know of it i ve noticed he is a ticklish subject it was at luise ivanovna s
that ilya petrovitch is at the bottom of it
he took advantage of your fainting at the police station but he is ashamed of it himself now i know that
razumihin was drunk enough to talk too freely
i fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint said raskolnikov
and it wasn t the paint only the fever had been coming on for a month zossimov testifies to that
but how crushed that boy is now you wouldn t believe
i am not worth his little finger he says
he has good feelings at times brother
but the lesson the lesson you gave him in the palais de cristal that was too good for anything
you frightened him at first you know he nearly went into convulsions
you almost convinced him again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense and then you suddenly put out your tongue at him there now what do you make of it
it was masterly by jove it s what they deserve
he was hoping to see you awfully
porfiry too wants to make your acquaintance
but why did they put me down as mad
i must have said too much brother
what struck him you see was that only that subject seemed to interest you now it s clear why it did interest you knowing all the circumstances and how that irritated you and worked in with your illness
i am a little drunk brother only confound him he has some idea of his own
i tell you he s mad on mental diseases
for half a minute both were silent
listen razumihin began raskolnikov i want to tell you plainly i ve just been at a a clerk who died
i gave them all my money and besides i ve just been kissed by someone who if i had killed anyone would just the same in fact i saw someone else there with a feather
but i am talking nonsense i am very weak support me we shall be at the stairs directly
i am a little giddy but that s not the point i am so sad so sad like a woman
they were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs at the level of the landlady s door and they could as a fact see from below that there was a light in raskolnikov s garret
nastasya perhaps observed razumihin
she is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago but
i am coming with you we ll come in together
i know we are going in together but i want to shake hands here and say to you here
what s the matter with you rodya nothing come along
they began mounting the stairs and the idea struck razumihin that perhaps zossimov might be right after all
ah i ve upset him with my chatter
when they reached the door they heard voices in the room
raskolnikov was the first to open the door he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway dumbfoundered
his mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an hour and a half for him
why had he never expected never thought of them though the news that they had started were on their way and would arrive immediately had been repeated to him only that day
they had spent that hour and a half plying nastasya with questions
she was standing before them and had told them everything by now
they were beside themselves with alarm when they heard of his running away ill and as they understood from her story delirious
good heavens what had become of him
both had been weeping both had been in anguish for that hour and a half
a cry of joy of ecstasy greeted raskolnikov s entrance
but he stood like one dead a sudden intolerable sensation struck him like a thunderbolt
he did not lift his arms to embrace them he could not
his mother and sister clasped him in their arms kissed him laughed and cried
he took a step tottered and fell to the ground fainting
razumihin who was standing in the doorway flew into the room seized the sick man in his strong arms and in a moment had him on the sofa
he cried to the mother and sister it s only a faint a mere trifle
only just now the doctor said he was much better that he is perfectly well
see he is coming to himself he is all right again
and seizing dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it he made her bend down to see that he is all right again
the mother and sister looked on him with emotion and gratitude as their providence
they had heard already from nastasya all that had been done for their rodya during his illness by this very competent young man as pulcheria alexandrovna raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation with dounia
i raskolnikov got up and sat down on the sofa
he waved his hand weakly to razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations he was addressing to his mother and sister took them both by the hand and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking
his mother was alarmed by his expression
it revealed an emotion agonisingly poignant and at the same time something immovable almost insane
pulcheria alexandrovna began to cry
avdotya romanovna was pale her hand trembled in her brother s
go home with him he said in a broken voice pointing to razumihin till everything
this evening rodya answered pulcheria alexandrovna the train was awfully late
but rodya nothing would induce me to leave you now
i will spend the night here near you
he said with a gesture of irritation
i will stay with him cried razumihin i won t leave him for a moment
let them rage to their hearts content
pulcheria alexandrovna was beginning once more pressing razumihin s hands but raskolnikov interrupted her again
he repeated irritably don t worry me
come mamma come out of the room at least for a minute dounia whispered in dismay we are distressing him that s evident
mayn t i look at him after three years wept pulcheria alexandrovna
stay he stopped them again you keep interrupting me and my ideas get muddled
no rodya but he knows already of our arrival
we have heard rodya that pyotr petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today pulcheria alexandrovna added somewhat timidly
yes he was so kind dounia i promised luzhin i d throw him downstairs and told him to go to hell
surely you don t mean to tell us
pulcheria alexandrovna began in alarm but she stopped looking at dounia
avdotya romanovna was looking attentively at her brother waiting for what would come next
both of them had heard of the quarrel from nastasya so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it and were in painful perplexity and suspense
dounia raskolnikov continued with an effort i don t want that marriage so at the first opportunity you must refuse luzhin so that we may never hear his name again
good heavens cried pulcheria alexandrovna
brother think what you are saying
avdotya romanovna began impetuously but immediately checked herself
you are not fit to talk now perhaps you are tired she added gently
no you are marrying luzhin for sake
but i won t accept the sacrifice
and so write a letter before to refuse him
let me read it in the morning and that will be the end of it
the girl cried offended what right have you
dounia you are hasty too be quiet
the mother interposed in dismay
he is raving razumihin cried tipsily or how would he dare
all this nonsense will be over he certainly did drive him away
he made speeches here wanted to show off his learning and he went out
then it s true cried pulcheria alexandrovna
till brother said dounia compassionately let us go mother
do you hear sister he repeated after them making a last effort i am not delirious this marriage is an infamy
let me act like a scoundrel but you mustn t
one is enough and though i am a scoundrel i wouldn t own such a sister
despot roared razumihin but raskolnikov did not and perhaps could not answer
he lay down on the sofa and turned to the wall utterly exhausted
avdotya romanovna looked with interest at razumihin her black eyes flashed razumihin positively started at her glance
pulcheria alexandrovna stood overwhelmed
nothing would induce me to go she whispered in despair to razumihin
i will stay somewhere here escort dounia home
you ll spoil everything razumihin answered in the same whisper losing patience come out on to the stairs anyway
i assure you he went on in a half whisper on the stairs that he was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon
even he gave way and left him so as not to irritate him
i remained downstairs on guard but he dressed at once and slipped off
and he will slip off again if you irritate him at this time of night and will do himself some mischief
and avdotya romanovna can t possibly be left in those lodgings without you
just think where you are staying
that blackguard pyotr petrovitch couldn t find you better lodgings
but you know i ve had a little to drink and that s what makes me swear don t mind it
but i ll go to the landlady here pulcheria alexandrovna insisted i ll beseech her to find some corner for dounia and me for the night
i can t leave him like that i can not
this conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady s door
nastasya lighted them from a step below
razumihin was in extraordinary excitement
half an hour earlier while he was bringing raskolnikov home he had indeed talked too freely but he was aware of it himself and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he had imbibed
now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy and all that he had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect
he stood with the two ladies seizing both by their hands persuading them and giving them reasons with astonishing plainness of speech and at almost every word he uttered probably to emphasise his arguments he squeezed their hands painfully as in a vise
he stared at avdotya romanovna without the least regard for good manners
they sometimes pulled their hands out of his huge bony paws but far from noticing what was the matter he drew them all the closer to him
if they d told him to jump head foremost from the staircase he would have done it without thought or hesitation in their service
though pulcheria alexandrovna felt that the young man was really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much in her anxiety over her rodya she looked on his presence as providential and was unwilling to notice all his peculiarities
but though avdotya romanovna shared her anxiety and was not of timorous disposition she could not see the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm
it was only the unbounded confidence inspired by nastasya s account of her brother s queer friend which prevented her from trying to run away from him and to persuade her mother to do the same
she realised too that even running away was perhaps impossible now
ten minutes later however she was considerably reassured it was characteristic of razumihin that he showed his true nature at once whatever mood he might be in so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with
you can t go to the landlady that s perfect nonsense
if you stay though you are his mother you ll drive him to a frenzy and then goodness knows what will happen
listen i ll tell you what i ll do nastasya will stay with him now and i ll conduct you both home you can t be in the streets alone petersburg is an awful place in that way
then i ll run straight back here and a quarter of an hour later on my word of honour i ll bring you news how he is whether he is asleep and all that
then i ll run home in a twinkling i ve a lot of friends there all drunk i ll fetch zossimov that s the doctor who is looking after him he is there too but he is not drunk he is not drunk he is never drunk
i ll drag him to rodya and then to you so that you ll get two reports in the hour from the doctor you understand from the doctor himself that s a very different thing from my account of him
if there s anything wrong i swear i ll bring you here myself but if it s all right you go to bed
and i ll spend the night here in the passage he won t hear me and i ll tell zossimov to sleep at the landlady s to be at hand
which is better for him you or the doctor
but the landlady is out of the question it s all right for me but it s out of the question for you she wouldn t take you for she s
she d be jealous on my account of avdotya romanovna and of you too if you want to know of avdotya romanovna certainly
she is an absolutely absolutely unaccountable character
let us go mother said avdotya romanovna he will certainly do what he has promised
he has saved rodya already and if the doctor really will consent to spend the night here what could be better
you see you you understand me because you are an angel
razumihin cried in ecstasy let us go
fly upstairs and sit with him with a light i ll come in a quarter of an hour
though pulcheria alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced she made no further resistance
razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down the stairs
he still made her uneasy as though he was competent and was he capable of carrying out his promise
ah i see you think i am in such a condition
razumihin broke in upon her thoughts guessing them as he strolled along the pavement with huge steps so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him a fact he did not observe however
i am drunk like a fool but that s not it i am not drunk from wine
it s seeing you has turned my head
don t take any notice i am talking nonsense i am not worthy of you
the minute i ve taken you home i ll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over my head in the gutter here and then i shall be all right
if only you knew how i love you both
you may be angry with anyone but not with me
i am his friend and therefore i am your friend too i want to be
last year there was a moment though it wasn t a presentiment really for you seem to have fallen from heaven
and i expect i shan t sleep all night
zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad that s why he mustn t be irritated
what do you say cried the mother
did the doctor really say that asked avdotya romanovna alarmed
yes but it s not so not a bit of it
he gave him some medicine a powder i saw it and then your coming here
it would have been better if you had come
and in an hour zossimov himself will report to you about everything
because they got me into an argument damn them
would you believe they insist on complete absence of individualism and that s just what they relish
not to be themselves to be as unlike themselves as they can
that s what they regard as the highest point of progress
if only their nonsense were their own but as it is listen
pulcheria alexandrovna interrupted timidly but it only added fuel to the flames
what do you think shouted razumihin louder than ever you think i am attacking them for talking nonsense
that s man s one privilege over all creation
through error you come to the truth
you never reach any truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and fourteen
and a fine thing too in its way but we can t even make mistakes on our own account
talk nonsense but talk your own nonsense and i ll kiss you for it
to go wrong in one s own way is better than to go right in someone else s
in the first case you are a man in the second you re no better than a bird
truth won t escape you but life can be cramped
in science development thought invention ideals aims liberalism judgment experience and everything everything everything we are still in the preparatory class at school
we prefer to live on other people s ideas it s what we are used to
am i right am i right cried razumihin pressing and shaking the two ladies hands
oh mercy i do not know cried poor pulcheria alexandrovna
yes yes though i don t agree with you in everything added avdotya romanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry for he squeezed her hand so painfully
well after that you you he cried in a transport you are a fount of goodness purity sense and perfection
i want to kiss your hands here at once on my knees and he fell on his knees on the pavement fortunately at that time deserted
leave off i entreat you what are you doing
pulcheria alexandrovna cried greatly distressed
get up get up said dounia laughing though she too was upset
not for anything till you let me kiss your hands
i am a luckless fool i am unworthy of you and drunk and i am ashamed
i am not worthy to love you but to do homage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast
here are your lodgings and for that alone rodya was right in driving your pyotr petrovitch away
how dare he put you in such lodgings
do you know the sort of people they take in here
excuse me razumihin you are forgetting
pulcheria alexandrovna was beginning
yes yes you are right i did forget myself i am ashamed of it razumihin made haste to apologise
but but you can t be angry with me for speaking so
for i speak sincerely and not because hm hm
that would be disgraceful in fact not because i m in hm
well anyway i won t say why i daren t
but we all saw when he came in that that man is not of our sort
not because he had his hair curled at the barber s not because he was in such a hurry to show his wit but because he is a spy a speculator because he is a and a buffoon
he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms though all my friends there are drunk yet they are all honest and though we do talk a lot of trash and i do too yet we shall talk our way to the truth at last for we are on the right path while pyotr petrovitch is not on the right path
though i ve been calling them all sorts of names just now i do respect them all though i don t respect zametov i like him for he is a puppy and that bullock zossimov because he is an honest man and knows his work
but enough it s all said and forgiven
i know this corridor i ve been here there was a scandal here at number  where are you here
well lock yourselves in for the night then
in a quarter of an hour i ll come back with news and half an hour later i ll bring zossimov you ll see
good heavens dounia what is going to happen said pulcheria alexandrovna addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay
don t worry yourself mother said dounia taking off her hat and cape
god has sent this gentleman to our aid though he has come from a drinking party
we can depend on him i assure you
and all that he has done for rodya ah
dounia goodness knows whether he will come
how could i bring myself to leave rodya
and how different how different i had fancied our meeting
how sullen he was as though not pleased to see us
you didn t see you were crying all the time
he is quite unhinged by serious illness that s the reason
what will happen what will happen
and how he talked to you dounia said the mother looking timidly at her daughter trying to read her thoughts and already half consoled by dounia s standing up for her brother which meant that she had already forgiven him
i am sure he will think better of it she added probing her further
and i am sure that he will say the same about that avdotya romanovna said finally
and of course there was no going beyond that for this was a point which pulcheria alexandrovna was afraid to discuss
dounia went up and kissed her mother
the latter warmly embraced her without speaking
then she sat down to wait anxiously for razumihin s return timidly watching her daughter who walked up and down the room with her arms folded lost in thought
this walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of avdotya romanovna s and the mother was always afraid to break in on her daughter s mood at such moments
razumihin of course was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation for avdotya romanovna
yet apart from his eccentric condition many people would have thought it justified if they had seen avdotya romanovna especially at that moment when she was walking to and fro with folded arms pensive and melancholy
avdotya romanovna was remarkably she was tall strikingly strong and the latter quality was apparent in every gesture though it did not in the least detract from the grace and softness of her movements
in face she resembled her brother but she might be described as really beautiful
her hair was dark brown a little lighter than her brother s there was a proud light in her almost black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness
she was pale but it was a healthy pallor her face was radiant with freshness and vigour
her mouth was rather small the full red lower lip projected a little as did her chin it was the only irregularity in her beautiful face but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty expression
her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay but how well smiles how well youthful lighthearted irresponsible laughter suited her face
it was natural enough that a warm open honest giant like razumihin who had never seen anyone like her and was not quite sober at the time should lose his head immediately
besides as chance would have it he saw dounia for the first time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at meeting him
afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation at her brother s insolent cruel and ungrateful words and his fate was sealed
he had spoken the truth moreover when he blurted out in his drunken talk on the stairs that praskovya pavlovna raskolnikov s eccentric landlady would be jealous of pulcheria alexandrovna as well as of avdotya romanovna on his account
although pulcheria alexandrovna was her face still retained traces of her former beauty she looked much younger than her age indeed which is almost always the case with women who retain serenity of spirit sensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age
we may add in parenthesis that to preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age
her hair had begun to grow grey and thin there had long been little crow s foot wrinkles round her eyes her cheeks were hollow and sunken from anxiety and grief and yet it was a handsome face
she was dounia over again twenty years older but without the projecting underlip
pulcheria alexandrovna was emotional but not sentimental timid and yielding but only to a certain point
she could give way and accept a great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions but there was a certain barrier fixed by honesty principle and the deepest convictions which nothing would induce her to cross
exactly twenty minutes after razumihin s departure there came two subdued but hurried knocks at the door he had come back
i won t come in i haven t time he hastened to say when the door was opened
he sleeps like a top soundly quietly and god grant he may sleep ten hours
nastasya s with him i told her not to leave till i came
now i am fetching zossimov he will report to you and then you d better turn in i can see you are too tired to do anything
and he ran off down the corridor
what a very competent and devoted young man cried pulcheria alexandrovna exceedingly delighted
avdotya romanovna replied with some warmth resuming her walk up and down the room
it was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor and another knock at the door
both women waited this time completely relying on razumihin s promise he actually had succeeded in bringing zossimov
zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to go to raskolnikov s but he came reluctantly and with the greatest suspicion to see the ladies mistrusting razumihin in his exhilarated condition
but his vanity was at once reassured and flattered he saw that they were really expecting him as an oracle
he stayed just ten minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting pulcheria alexandrovna
he spoke with marked sympathy but with the reserve and extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation
he did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the slightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two ladies
remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of avdotya romanovna he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and addressed himself solely to pulcheria alexandrovna
all this gave him extraordinary inward satisfaction
he declared that he thought the invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily
according to his observations the patient s illness was due partly to his unfortunate material surroundings during the last few months but it had partly also a moral origin was so to speak the product of several material and moral influences anxieties apprehensions troubles certain ideas and so on
noticing stealthily that avdotya romanovna was following his words with close attention zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this theme
on pulcheria alexandrovna s anxiously and timidly inquiring as to some suspicion of insanity he replied with a composed and candid smile that his words had been exaggerated that certainly the patient had some fixed idea something approaching a monomania he zossimov was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine but that it must be recollected that until the patient had been in delirium and and that no doubt the presence of his family would have a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind if only all fresh shocks can be avoided he added significantly
then he got up took leave with an impressive and affable bow while blessings warm gratitude and entreaties were showered upon him and avdotya romanovna spontaneously offered her hand to him
he went out exceedingly pleased with his visit and still more so with himself
razumihin said in conclusion following zossimov out
i ll be with you morning as early as possible with my report
that s a fetching little girl avdotya romanovna remarked zossimov almost licking his lips as they both came out into the street
you said fetching roared razumihin and he flew at zossimov and seized him by the throat
he shouted shaking him by the collar and squeezing him against the wall
let me go you drunken devil said zossimov struggling and when he had let him go he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw
razumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection
of course i am an ass he observed sombre as a storm cloud but still
no brother not at all such another
they walked along in silence and only when they were close to raskolnikov s lodgings razumihin broke the silence in considerable anxiety
listen he said you re a fellow but among your other failings you re a loose fish that i know and a dirty one too
you are a feeble nervous wretch and a mass of whims you re getting fat and lazy and can t deny yourself anything and i call that dirty because it leads one straight into the dirt
you ve let yourself get so slack that i don t know how it is you are still a good even a devoted doctor
you a doctor sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your patients
in another three or four years you won t get up for your patients
but hang it all that s not the point
you are going to spend in the landlady s flat here
hard work i ve had to persuade her
so here s a chance for you to get to know her better
there s not a trace of anything of the sort brother
here you have modesty brother silence bashfulness a savage virtue and yet she s sighing and melting like wax simply melting
save me from her by all that s unholy
i ll repay you i ll do anything
zossimov laughed more violently than ever
it won t be much trouble i assure you
talk any rot you like to her as long as you sit by her and talk
you re a doctor too try curing her of something
she has a piano and you know i strum a little
i have a song there a genuine russian one i shed hot tears
she likes the genuine article and well it all began with that song now you re a regular performer a a rubinstein
i assure you you won t regret it
but have you made her some promise
a promise of marriage perhaps nothing nothing absolutely nothing of the kind
besides she is not that sort at all
well i can t that s all about it
there s an element of attraction here brother
then why have you fascinated her
i haven t fascinated her perhaps i was fascinated myself in my folly
but she won t care a straw whether it s you or i so long as somebody sits beside her sighing
i can t explain the position brother look here you are good at mathematics and working at it now begin teaching her the integral calculus upon my soul i m not joking i m in earnest it ll be just the same to her
she will gaze at you and sigh for a whole year together
i talked to her once for two days at a time about the prussian house of lords for one must talk of something she just sighed and perspired
and you mustn t talk of love she s bashful to hysterics but just let her see you can t tear yourself away that s enough
it s fearfully comfortable you re quite at home you can read sit lie about write
you may even venture on a kiss if you re careful
ach i can t make you understand
you see you are made for each other
i have often been reminded of you
so does it matter whether it s sooner or later
there s the element here brother ach
there s an attraction here here you have the end of the world an anchorage a quiet haven the navel of the earth the three fishes that are the foundation of the world the essence of pancakes of savoury of the evening samovar of soft sighs and warm shawls and hot stoves to sleep on as snug as though you were dead and yet you re alive the advantages of both at once
well hang it brother what stuff i m talking it s bedtime
i sometimes wake up at night so i ll go in and look at him
but there s no need it s all right
don t you worry yourself yet if you like you might just look in once too
but if you notice anything delirium or fever wake me at once
but there can t be chapter ii razumihin waked up next morning at eight o clock troubled and serious
he found himself confronted with many new and perplexities
he had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that
he remembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly novel experience had befallen him that he had received an impression unlike anything he had known before
at the same time he recognised clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly unattainable so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it and he hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties bequeathed him by that thrice accursed yesterday
the most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown himself base and mean not only because he had been drunk but because he had taken advantage of the young girl s position to abuse her in his stupid jealousy knowing nothing of their mutual relations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself
and what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner
was it thinkable that such a creature as avdotya romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money
so there must be something in him
but after all how could he know the character of the lodgings
and what justification was it that he was drunk
such a stupid excuse was even more degrading
in wine is truth and the truth had all come out that is all the uncleanness of his coarse and envious heart
and would such a dream ever be permissible to him razumihin
what was he beside such a girl he the drunken noisy braggart of last night
was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical a juxtaposition
razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of avdotya romanovna that was simply intolerable
he brought his fist down heavily on the kitchen stove hurt his hand and sent one of the bricks flying
of course he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of of course all these infamies can never be wiped out or smoothed over and so it s useless even to think of it and i must go to them in silence and do my duty in silence too and not ask forgiveness and say nothing for all is lost now
and yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual
he hadn t another suit if he had had perhaps he wouldn t have put it on
i would have made a point of not putting it on
but in any case he could not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven he had no right to offend the feelings of others especially when they were in need of his assistance and asking him to see them
he brushed his clothes carefully
his linen was always decent in that respect he was especially clean
he washed that morning scrupulously he got some soap from nastasya he washed his hair his neck and especially his hands
when it came to the question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not praskovya pavlovna had capital razors that had been left by her late husband the question was angrily answered in the negative
what if they think that i shaved on purpose to
and the worst of it was he was so coarse so dirty he had the manners of a pothouse and and even admitting that he knew he had some of the essentials of a gentleman
what was there in that to be proud of
everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that and all the same he remembered he too had done little things not exactly dishonest and yet
and what thoughts he sometimes had hm and to set all that beside avdotya romanovna
well he d make a point then of being dirty greasy pothouse in his manners and he wouldn t care
he was engaged in such monologues when zossimov who had spent the night in praskovya pavlovna s parlour came in
he was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first
razumihin informed him that raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse
zossimov gave orders that they shouldn t wake him and promised to see him again about eleven
if he is still at home he added
if one can t control one s patients how is one to cure them
do you know whether will go to them or whether are coming here
they are coming i think said razumihin understanding the object of the question and they will discuss their family affairs no doubt
you as the doctor have more right to be here than i
but i am not a father confessor i shall come and go away i ve plenty to do besides looking after them
one thing worries me interposed razumihin frowning
on the way home i talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him all sorts of things and amongst them that you were afraid that he might become insane
that s nonsense i tell you how could i think it seriously
you yourself described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to him and we added fuel to the fire yesterday you did that is with your story about the painter it was a nice conversation when he was perhaps mad on that very point
if only i d known what happened then at the police station and that some wretch had insulted him with this suspicion
hm i would not have allowed that conversation yesterday
these monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a and see their fancies as solid realities
as far as i remember it was zametov s story that cleared up half the mystery to my mind
why i know one case in which a hypochondriac a man of forty cut the throat of a little boy of eight because he couldn t endure the jokes he made every day at table
and in this case his rags the insolent police officer the fever and this suspicion
all that working upon a man half frantic with hypochondria and with his morbid exceptional vanity
that may well have been the of illness
and by the way that zametov certainly is a nice fellow but hm he shouldn t have told all that last night
and by the way have you any influence on them his mother and sister
tell them to be more careful with him
why is he so set against this luzhin
a man with money and she doesn t seem to dislike him and they haven t a farthing i suppose
but what business is it of yours
how can i tell whether they ve a farthing
ask them yourself and perhaps you ll find out foo
last night s wine has not gone off yet
thank your praskovya pavlovna from me for my night s lodging
she locked herself in made no reply to my through the door she was up at seven o clock the samovar was taken into her from the kitchen
i was not vouchsafed a personal interview
at nine o clock precisely razumihin reached the lodgings at bakaleyev s house
both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience
they had risen at seven o clock or earlier
he entered looking as black as night bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it
he had reckoned without his host pulcheria alexandrovna fairly rushed at him seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them
he glanced timidly at avdotya romanovna but her proud countenance wore at that moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness such complete and respect in place of the sneering looks and contempt he had expected that it threw him into greater confusion than if he had been met with abuse
fortunately there was a subject for conversation and he made haste to snatch at it
hearing that everything was going well and that rodya had not yet waked pulcheria alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it because she had something which it was very very necessary to talk over beforehand
then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation to have it with them they had waited to have it with him
avdotya romanovna rang the bell it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter and they asked him to bring tea which was served at last but in such a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed
razumihin vigorously attacked the lodgings but remembering luzhin stopped in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by pulcheria alexandrovna s questions which showered in a continual stream upon him
he talked for three quarters of an hour being constantly interrupted by their questions and succeeded in describing to them all the most important facts he knew of the last year of raskolnikov s life concluding with a circumstantial account of his illness
he omitted however many things which were better omitted including the scene at the police station with all its consequences
they listened eagerly to his story and when he thought he had finished and satisfied his listeners he found that they considered he had hardly begun
excuse me i still don t know your name
pulcheria alexandrovna put in hastily
i should like very very much to know dmitri prokofitch
how he looks on things in general now that is how can i explain what are his likes and dislikes
tell me if you can what are his hopes and so to say his dreams
under what influences is he now
ah mother how can he answer all that at once observed dounia
good heavens i had not expected to find him in the least like this dmitri prokofitch
i have no mother but my uncle comes every year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me even in appearance though he is a clever man and your three years separation means a great deal
i have known rodion for a year and a half he is morose gloomy proud and haughty and of late and perhaps for a long time before he has been suspicious and fanciful
he has a noble nature and a kind heart
he does not like showing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his heart freely
sometimes though he is not at all morbid but simply cold and inhumanly callous it s as though he were alternating between two characters
sometimes he is fearfully reserved
he says he is so busy that everything is a hindrance and yet he lies in bed doing nothing
he doesn t jeer at things not because he hasn t the wit but as though he hadn t time to waste on such trifles
he never listens to what is said to him
he is never interested in what interests other people at any given moment
he thinks very highly of himself and perhaps he is right
i think your arrival will have a most beneficial influence upon him
god grant it may cried pulcheria alexandrovna distressed by razumihin s account of her rodya
and razumihin ventured to look more boldly at avdotya romanovna at last
he glanced at her often while he was talking but only for a moment and looked away again at once
avdotya romanovna sat at the table listening attentively then got up again and began walking to and fro with her arms folded and her lips compressed occasionally putting in a question without stopping her walk
she had the same habit of not listening to what was said
she was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff
and she had a white transparent scarf round her neck
razumihin soon detected signs of extreme poverty in their belongings
had avdotya romanovna been dressed like a queen he felt that he would not be afraid of her but perhaps just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery of her surroundings his heart was filled with dread and he began to be afraid of every word he uttered every gesture he made which was very trying for a man who already felt diffident
you ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother s character and have told it impartially
i thought that you were too uncritically devoted to him observed avdotya romanovna with a smile
i think you are right that he needs a woman s care she added thoughtfully
i didn t say so but i daresay you are right only what
he loves no one and perhaps he never will razumihin declared decisively
you mean he is not capable of love
do you know avdotya romanovna you are awfully like your brother in everything indeed
he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise but remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion
avdotya romanovna couldn t help laughing when she looked at him
you may both be mistaken about rodya pulcheria alexandrovna remarked slightly piqued
i am not talking of our present difficulty dounia
what pyotr petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and i have supposed may be mistaken but you can t imagine dmitri prokofitch how moody and so to say capricious he is
i never could depend on what he would do when he was only fifteen
and i am sure that he might do something now that nobody else would think of doing
well for instance do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave me a shock that nearly killed me when he had the idea of marrying that girl what was her name his landlady s daughter
did you hear about that affair asked avdotya romanovna
do you suppose pulcheria alexandrovna continued warmly
do you suppose that my tears my entreaties my illness my possible death from grief our poverty would have made him pause
no he would calmly have disregarded all obstacles
and yet it isn t that he doesn t love us
he has never spoken a word of that affair to me razumihin answered cautiously
but i did hear something from praskovya pavlovna herself though she is by no means a gossip
and what i heard certainly was rather strange
i only learned that the marriage which only failed to take place through the girl s death was not at all to praskovya pavlovna s liking
they say too the girl was not at all pretty in fact i am told positively ugly and such an invalid and queer
but she seems to have had some good qualities
she must have had some good qualities or it s quite inexplicable
she had no money either and he wouldn t have considered her money
but it s always difficult to judge in such matters
i am sure she was a good girl avdotya romanovna observed briefly
god forgive me i simply rejoiced at her death
though i don t know which of them would have caused most misery to the other he to her or she to him pulcheria alexandrovna concluded
then she began tentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with luzhin hesitating and continually glancing at dounia obviously to the latter s annoyance
this incident more than all the rest evidently caused her uneasiness even consternation
razumihin described it in detail again but this time he added his own conclusions he openly blamed raskolnikov for intentionally insulting pyotr petrovitch not seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness
he had planned it before his illness he added
i think so too pulcheria alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air
but she was very much surprised at hearing razumihin express himself so carefully and even with a certain respect about pyotr petrovitch
avdotya romanovna too was struck by it
so this is your opinion of pyotr petrovitch
pulcheria alexandrovna could not resist asking
i can have no other opinion of your daughter s future husband razumihin answered firmly and with warmth and i don t say it simply from vulgar politeness but because simply because avdotya romanovna has of her own free will deigned to accept this man
if i spoke so rudely of him last night it was because i was disgustingly drunk and mad besides yes mad crazy i lost my head completely and this morning i am ashamed of it
he crimsoned and ceased speaking
avdotya romanovna flushed but did not break the silence
she had not uttered a word from the moment they began to speak of luzhin
without her support pulcheria alexandrovna obviously did not know what to do
at last faltering and continually glancing at her daughter she confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance
you see dmitri prokofitch she began
i ll be perfectly open with dmitri prokofitch dounia
of course mother said avdotya romanovna emphatically
this is what it is she began in haste as though the permission to speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind
very early this morning we got a note from pyotr petrovitch in reply to our letter announcing our arrival
he promised to meet us at the station you know instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these lodgings and to show us the way and he sent a message that he would be here himself this morning
but this morning this note came from him
you d better read it yourself there is one point in it which worries me very much
you will soon see what that is and tell me your candid opinion dmitri prokofitch
you know rodya s character better than anyone and no one can advise us better than you can
dounia i must tell you made her decision at once but i still don t feel sure how to act and i
i ve been waiting for your opinion
razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read as follows dear madam pulcheria alexandrovna i have the honour to inform you that owing to unforeseen obstacles i was rendered unable to meet you at the railway station i sent a very competent person with the same object in view
i likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with you morning by business in the senate that does not admit of delay and also that i may not intrude on your family circle while you are meeting your son and avdotya romanovna her brother
i shall have the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings not later than evening at eight o clock precisely and herewith i venture to present my earnest and i may add imperative request that rodion romanovitch may not be present at our interview as he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my visit to him in his illness yesterday and moreover since i desire from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation upon a certain point in regard to which i wish to learn your own interpretation
i have the honour to inform you in anticipation that if in spite of my request i meet rodion romanovitch i shall be compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to blame
i write on the assumption that rodion romanovitch who appeared so ill at my visit suddenly recovered two hours later and so being able to leave the house may visit you also
i was confirmed in that belief by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who was run over and has since died to whose daughter a young woman of notorious behaviour he gave roubles on the pretext of the funeral which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to raise that sum
herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable daughter avdotya romanovna i beg you to accept the respectful homage of your humble servant p luzhin
what am i to do now dmitri prokofitch began pulcheria alexandrovna almost weeping
how can i ask rodya not to come
yesterday he insisted so earnestly on our refusing pyotr petrovitch and now we are ordered not to receive rodya
he will come on purpose if he knows and what will happen then act on avdotya romanovna s decision razumihin answered calmly at once
goodness knows what she says she doesn t explain her object
she says that it would be best at least not that it would be best but that it s absolutely necessary that rodya should make a point of being here at eight o clock and that they must meet
i didn t want even to show him the letter but to prevent him from coming by some stratagem with your help because he is so irritable
besides i don t understand about that drunkard who died and that daughter and how he could have given the daughter all the money which which cost you such sacrifice mother put in avdotya romanovna
he was not himself yesterday razumihin said thoughtfully if you only knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday though there was sense in it too
he did say something as we were going home yesterday evening about a dead man and a girl but i didn t understand a word
the best thing mother will be for us to go to him ourselves and there i assure you we shall see at once what s to be done
besides it s getting late good heavens it s past ten she cried looking at a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin venetian chain and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her dress
a present from her thought razumihin
we must start dounia we must start her mother cried in a flutter
he will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday from our coming so late
while she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle dounia too put on her things
her gloves as razumihin noticed were not merely shabby but had holes in them and yet this evident poverty gave the two ladies an air of special dignity which is always found in people who know how to wear poor clothes
razumihin looked reverently at dounia and felt proud of escorting her
the queen who mended her stockings in prison he thought must have looked then every inch a queen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and lev√©es
my god exclaimed pulcheria alexandrovna little did i think that i should ever fear seeing my son my darling darling rodya
i am afraid dmitri prokofitch she added glancing at him timidly
don t be afraid mother said dounia kissing her better have faith in him
oh dear i have faith in him but i haven t slept all night exclaimed the poor woman
do you know dounia when i dozed a little this morning i dreamed of marfa petrovna
she came up to me took my hand and shook her head at me but so sternly as though she were blaming me
you don t know dmitri prokofitch that marfa petrovna s dead
no i didn t know who is marfa petrovna
she died suddenly and only fancy
he doesn t know who marfa petrovna is
and i was thinking that you knew all about us
forgive me dmitri prokofitch i don t know what i am thinking about these last few days
i look upon you really as a providence for us and so i took it for granted that you knew all about us
don t be angry with me for saying so
dear me what s the matter with your right hand
yes i bruised it muttered razumihin overjoyed
i sometimes speak too much from the heart so that dounia finds fault with me
but dear me what a cupboard he lives in
does this woman his landlady consider it a room
listen you say he does not like to show his feelings so perhaps i shall annoy him with my weaknesses
do advise me dmitri prokofitch how am i to treat him
i feel quite distracted you know
don t question him too much about anything if you see him frown don t ask him too much about his health he doesn t like that
ah dmitri prokofitch how hard it is to be a mother
mother you are quite pale don t distress yourself darling said dounia caressing her then with flashing eyes she added he ought to be happy at seeing you and you are tormenting yourself so
wait i ll peep in and see whether he has waked up
the ladies slowly followed razumihin who went on before and when they reached the landlady s door on the fourth storey they noticed that her door was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching them from the darkness within
when their eyes met the door was suddenly shut with such a slam that pulcheria alexandrovna almost cried out
chapter iii he is well quite well
zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered
he had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place as before on the sofa
raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner fully dressed and carefully washed and combed as he had not been for some time past
the room was immediately crowded yet nastasya managed to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen
raskolnikov really was almost well as compared with his condition the day before but he was still pale listless and sombre
he looked like a wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering
his brows were knitted his lips compressed his eyes feverish
he spoke little and reluctantly as though performing a duty and there was a restlessness in his movements
he only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm
the pale sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister entered but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering in place of its listless dejection
the light soon died away but the look of suffering remained and zossimov watching and studying his patient with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise noticed in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister but a sort of bitter hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable torture
he saw later that almost every word of the following conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it
but at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had like a monomaniac fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word
yes i see myself now that i am almost well said raskolnikov giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made pulcheria alexandrovna radiant at once
and i don t say this i did he said addressing razumihin with a friendly pressure of his hand
yes indeed i am quite surprised at him began zossimov much delighted at the ladies entrance for he had not succeeded in keeping up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes
in another three or four days if he goes on like this he will be just as before that is as he was a month ago or two or perhaps even three
this has been coming on for a long while eh
confess now that it has been perhaps your own fault he added with a tentative smile as though still afraid of irritating him
it is very possible answered raskolnikov coldly
i should say too continued zossimov with zest that your complete recovery depends solely on yourself
now that one can talk to you i should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the elementary so to speak fundamental causes tending to produce your morbid condition in that case you will be cured if not it will go from bad to worse
these fundamental causes i don t know but they must be known to you
you are an intelligent man and must have observed yourself of course
i fancy the first stage of your derangement coincides with your leaving the university
you must not be left without occupation and so work and a definite aim set before you might i fancy be very beneficial
yes yes you are perfectly right
i will make haste and return to the university and then everything will go smoothly zossimov who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before the ladies was certainly somewhat mystified when glancing at his patient he observed unmistakable mockery on his face
pulcheria alexandrovna began at once thanking zossimov especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night
raskolnikov asked as though startled
then you have not slept either after your journey
ach rodya that was only till two o clock
dounia and i never go to bed before two at home
i don t know how to thank him either raskolnikov went on suddenly frowning and looking down
setting aside the question of payment forgive me for referring to it he turned to zossimov i really don t know what i have done to deserve such special attention from you
and it weighs upon me indeed because i don t understand it
zossimov forced himself to laugh
assume that you are my first patient well we fellows just beginning to practise love our first patients as if they were our children and some almost fall in love with them
and of course i am not rich in patients
i say nothing about him added raskolnikov pointing to razumihin though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble
why you are in a sentimental mood are you shouted razumihin
if he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no trace of sentimentality in him but something indeed quite the opposite
but avdotya romanovna noticed it
she was intently and uneasily watching her brother
as for you mother i don t dare to speak he went on as though repeating a lesson learned by heart
it is only that i have been able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here yesterday waiting for me to come back
when he had said this he suddenly held out his hand to his sister smiling without a word
but in this smile there was a flash of real unfeigned feeling
dounia caught it at once and warmly pressed his hand overjoyed and thankful
it was the first time he had addressed her since their dispute the previous day
the mother s face lighted up with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken reconciliation
yes that is what i love him for razumihin exaggerating it all muttered to himself with a vigorous turn in his chair
and how well he does it all the mother was thinking to herself
what generous impulses he has and how simply how delicately he put an end to all the misunderstanding with his sister simply by holding out his hand at the right minute and looking at her like that
and what fine eyes he has and how fine his whole face is
he is even better looking than dounia
but good heavens what a suit how terribly he s dressed
vasya the messenger boy in afanasy ivanitch s shop is better dressed
i could rush at him and hug him weep over him but i am afraid
he s talking kindly but i m afraid
oh rodya you wouldn t believe she began suddenly in haste to answer his words to her how unhappy dounia and i were yesterday
now that it s all over and done with and we are quite happy again i can tell you
fancy we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace you and that woman ah here she is
she told us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away from the doctor in delirium and they were looking for you in the streets
i couldn t help thinking of the tragic end of lieutenant potanchikov a friend of your father s you can t remember him rodya who ran out in the same way in a high fever and fell into the well in the and they couldn t pull him out till next day
of course we exaggerated things
we were on the point of rushing to find pyotr petrovitch to ask him to help
because we were alone utterly alone she said plaintively and stopped short suddenly recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of pyotr petrovitch although we are quite happy again
raskolnikov muttered in reply but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that dounia gazed at him in perplexity
what else was it i wanted to say
oh yes mother and you too dounia please don t think that i didn t mean to come and see you and was waiting for you to come first
what are you saying rodya cried pulcheria alexandrovna
is he being reconciled and asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating a lesson
i ve only just waked up and wanted to go to you but was delayed owing to my clothes i forgot yesterday to ask her nastasya to wash out the blood
pulcheria alexandrovna asked in alarm
it was when i was wandering about yesterday rather delirious i chanced upon a man who had been run over a clerk
that s true raskolnikov answered with special carefulness
i remember everything even to the slightest detail and yet why i did that and went there and said that i can t clearly explain now
a familiar phenomenon interposed zossimov actions are sometimes performed in a masterly and most cunning way while the direction of the actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions it s like a dream
perhaps it s a good thing really that he should think me almost a madman thought raskolnikov
why people in perfect health act in the same way too observed dounia looking uneasily at zossimov
there is some truth in your observation the latter replied
in that sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen but with the slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder for we must draw a line
a normal man it is true hardly exists
among dozens perhaps hundreds of thousands hardly one is to be met with
at the word madman carelessly dropped by zossimov in his chatter on his favourite subject everyone frowned
raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention plunged in thought with a strange smile on his pale lips
he was still meditating on something
well what about the man who was run over
what raskolnikov seemed to wake up
oh i got spattered with blood helping to carry him to his lodging
by the way mamma i did an unpardonable thing yesterday
i gave away all the money you sent me to his wife for the funeral
she s a widow now in consumption a poor creature three little children starving nothing in the house
there s a daughter too perhaps you d have given it yourself if you d seen them
i admit especially as i knew how you needed the money yourself
to help others one must have the right to do it or else chiens si vous n √™tes pas
he laughed that s right isn t it dounia
no it s not answered dounia firmly
bah you too have ideals he muttered looking at her almost with hatred and smiling sarcastically
i ought to have considered that
well that s praiseworthy and it s better for you
and if you reach a line you won t overstep you will be unhappy and if you overstep it maybe you will be still unhappier
but all that s nonsense he added irritably vexed at being carried away
i only meant to say that i beg your forgiveness mother he concluded shortly and abruptly
that s enough rodya i am sure that everything you do is very good said his mother delighted
don t be too sure he answered twisting his mouth into a smile
there was a certain constraint in all this conversation and in the silence and in the reconciliation and in the forgiveness and all were feeling it
it is as though they were afraid of me raskolnikov was thinking to himself looking askance at his mother and sister
pulcheria alexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent
yet in their absence i seemed to love them so much flashed through his mind
do you know rodya marfa petrovna is dead pulcheria alexandrovna suddenly blurted out
oh mercy on us marfa petrovna svidriga√Ølov
oh really he roused himself suddenly as if waking up
only imagine quite suddenly pulcheria alexandrovna answered hurriedly encouraged by his curiosity
on the very day i was sending you that letter
would you believe it that awful man seems to have been the cause of her death
they say he beat her dreadfully
why were they on such bad terms
with her he was always very patient considerate even
in fact all those seven years of their married life he gave way to her too much so indeed in many cases
all of a sudden he seems to have lost patience
then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven years
you seem to be defending him dounia
i can imagine nothing more awful
dounia answered almost with a shudder knitting her brows and sinking into thought
that had happened in the morning pulcheria alexandrovna went on hurriedly
and directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner
she always used to drive to the town in such cases
she ate a very good dinner i am told
after the beating that was always her habit and immediately after dinner so as not to be late in starting she went to the
you see she was undergoing some treatment with baths
they have a cold spring there and she used to bathe in it regularly every day and no sooner had she got into the water when she suddenly had a stroke
but i don t know why you want to tell us such gossip mother said raskolnikov irritably as it were in spite of himself
ah my dear i don t know what to talk about broke from pulcheria alexandrovna
he asked with a constrained smile
that s certainly true said dounia looking directly and sternly at her brother
mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the stairs
his face worked as though in convulsion
pulcheria alexandrovna began overwhelmed you see coming here i was dreaming all the way in the train how we should meet how we should talk over everything together
and i was so happy i did not notice the journey
i am happy now simply in seeing you rodya hush mother he muttered in confusion not looking at her but pressing her hand
we shall have time to speak freely of everything
as he said this he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned pale
again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly chill over his soul
again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to him that he had just told a fearful lie that he would never now be able to speak freely of everything that he would never again be able to of anything to anyone
the anguish of this thought was such that for a moment he almost forgot himself
he got up from his seat and not looking at anyone walked towards the door
what are you about cried razumihin clutching him by the arm
he sat down again and began looking about him in silence
they were all looking at him in perplexity
but what are you all so dull for
he shouted suddenly and quite unexpectedly
what s the use of sitting like this
we meet together and sit in silence
thank god i was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning again said pulcheria alexandrovna crossing herself
what is the matter rodya asked avdotya romanovna distrustfully
i remembered something he answered and suddenly laughed
well if you remembered something that s all right
muttered zossimov getting up from the sofa
i will look in again perhaps if i can
what an excellent man observed pulcheria alexandrovna
yes excellent splendid intelligent raskolnikov began suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity and a liveliness he had not shown till then
i can t remember where i met him before my illness
i believe i have met him somewhere
and this is a good man too he nodded at razumihin
he asked her and suddenly for some unknown reason laughed
razumihin protested blushing in terrible confusion and he got up from his chair
pulcheria alexandrovna smiled faintly but raskolnikov laughed aloud
what a pretty watch you have got dounia
but why are you all silent again
it was a present from marfa petrovna answered dounia
and a very expensive one added pulcheria alexandrovna
so it is not a present from her thought razumihin and was unreasonably delighted
i thought it was luzhin s present observed raskolnikov
no he has not made dounia any presents yet
and do you remember mother i was in love and wanted to get married
he said suddenly looking at his mother who was disconcerted by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it
pulcheria alexandrovna exchanged glances with dounia and razumihin
she was such a sickly girl he went on growing dreamy and looking down again
she was fond of giving alms to the poor and was always dreaming of a nunnery and once she burst into tears when she began talking to me about it
i really don t know what drew me to her then i think it was because she was always ill
if she had been lame or hunchback i believe i should have liked her better still he smiled dreamily
yes it was a sort of spring delirium
no it was not only spring delirium said dounia with warm feeling
he fixed a strained intent look on his sister but did not hear or did not understand her words
then completely lost in thought he got up went up to his mother kissed her went back to his place and sat down
you love her even now said pulcheria alexandrovna touched
no that s all now as it were in another world
and indeed everything happening here seems somehow far away
you now i seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away
but goodness knows why we are talking of that
and what s the use of asking about it
he added with annoyance and biting his nails fell into dreamy silence again
what a wretched lodging you have rodya
it s like a tomb said pulcheria alexandrovna suddenly breaking the oppressive silence
i am sure it s quite half through your lodging you have become so melancholy
my lodging he answered listlessly
yes the lodging had a great deal to do with it
if only you knew though what a strange thing you said just now mother he said laughing strangely
a little more and their companionship this mother and this sister with him after three years absence this intimate tone of conversation in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything would have been beyond his power of endurance
but there was one urgent matter which must be settled one way or the other that day so he had decided when he woke
now he was glad to remember it as a means of escape
listen dounia he began gravely and drily of course i beg your pardon for yesterday but i consider it my duty to tell you again that i do not withdraw from my chief point
if i am a scoundrel you must not be
if you marry luzhin i cease at once to look on you as a sister
it is the same as yesterday again pulcheria alexandrovna cried mournfully
and why do you call yourself a scoundrel
brother dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness
in all this there is a mistake on your part
i thought it over at night and found out the mistake
it is all because you seem to fancy i am sacrificing myself to someone and for someone
i am simply marrying for my own sake because things are hard for me
though of course i shall be glad if i succeed in being useful to my family
but that is not the chief motive for my decision
she is lying he thought to himself biting his nails vindictively
she won t admit she wants to do it out of charity
they even love as though they hate
in fact continued dounia i am marrying pyotr petrovitch because of two evils i choose the less
i intend to do honestly all he expects of me so i am not deceiving him
she too flushed and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes
all he asked with a malignant grin
both the manner and form of pyotr petrovitch s courtship showed me at once what he wanted
he may of course think too well of himself but i hope he esteems me too
you are intentionally lying simply from feminine obstinacy simply to hold your own against me
i have seen him and talked with him
so you are selling yourself for money and so in any case you are acting basely and i am glad at least that you can blush for it
i am not lying cried dounia losing her composure
i would not marry him if i were not convinced that he esteems me and thinks highly of me
i would not marry him if i were not firmly convinced that i can respect him
fortunately i can have convincing proof of it this very day and such a marriage is not a vileness as you say
and even if you were right if i really had determined on a vile action is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that
why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either
if i ruin anyone it is only myself
why do you look at me like that
rodya darling what s the matter good heavens
you have made him faint cried pulcheria alexandrovna
a little giddiness not fainting
in what way will you get convincing proof that you can respect him and that he esteems you as you said
mother show rodya pyotr petrovitch s letter said dounia
with trembling hands pulcheria alexandrovna gave him the letter
he took it with great interest but before opening it he suddenly looked with a sort of wonder at dounia
it is strange he said slowly as though struck by a new idea
what am i making such a fuss for
he said this as though to himself but said it aloud and looked for some time at his sister as though puzzled
he opened the letter at last still with the same look of strange wonder on his face
then slowly and attentively he began reading and read it through twice
pulcheria alexandrovna showed marked anxiety and all indeed expected something particular
what surprises me he began after a short pause handing the letter to his mother but not addressing anyone in particular is that he is a business man a lawyer and his conversation is pretentious indeed and yet he writes such an uneducated letter
they had expected something quite different
but they all write like that you know razumihin observed abruptly
we consulted him just now pulcheria alexandrovna began embarrassed
that s just the jargon of the courts razumihin put in
legal documents are written like that to this day
yes it s just legal business language not so very uneducated and not quite educated business language
pyotr petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap education he is proud indeed of having made his own way avdotya romanovna observed somewhat offended by her brother s tone
well if he s proud of it he has reason i don t deny it
you seem to be offended sister at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the letter and to think that i speak of such trifling matters on purpose to annoy you
it is quite the contrary an observation apropos of the style occurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand
there is one expression blame yourselves put in very significantly and plainly and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if i am present
that threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon you both if you are disobedient and to abandon you now after summoning you to petersburg
can one resent such an expression from luzhin as we should if he he pointed to razumihin had written it or zossimov or one of us
answered dounia with more animation
i saw clearly that it was too na√Øvely expressed and that perhaps he simply has no skill in writing that is a true criticism brother
it is expressed in legal style and sounds coarser than perhaps he intended
but i must disillusion you a little
there is one expression in the letter one slander about me and rather a contemptible one
i gave the money last night to the widow a woman in consumption crushed with trouble and not on the pretext of the funeral but simply to pay for the funeral and not to the daughter a young woman as he writes of notorious behaviour whom i saw last night for the first time in my life but to the widow
in all this i see a too hasty desire to slander me and to raise dissension between us
it is expressed again in legal jargon that is to say with a too obvious display of the aim and with a very na√Øve eagerness
he is a man of intelligence but to act sensibly intelligence is not enough
i don t think he has a great esteem for you
i tell you this simply to warn you because i sincerely wish for your good
she was only awaiting the evening
then what is your decision rodya asked pulcheria alexandrovna who was more uneasy than ever at the sudden new businesslike tone of his talk
you see pyotr petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this evening and that he will go away if you come
that of course is not for me to decide but for you first if you are not offended by such a request and secondly by dounia if she too is not offended
i will do what you think best he added drily
dounia has already decided and i fully agree with her pulcheria alexandrovna hastened to declare
i decided to ask you rodya to urge you not to fail to be with us at this interview said dounia
i will ask you too to be with us at eight o clock she said addressing razumihin
well since you have decided added pulcheria alexandrovna so be it
i do not like concealment and deception
better let us have the whole truth
pyotr petrovitch may be angry or not now
chapter iv at that moment the door was softly opened and a young girl walked into the room looking timidly about her
everyone turned towards her with surprise and curiosity
at first sight raskolnikov did not recognise her
it was sofya semyonovna marmeladov
he had seen her yesterday for the first time but at such a moment in such surroundings and in such a dress that his memory retained a very different image of her
now she was a modestly and young girl very young indeed almost like a child with a modest and refined manner with a candid but somewhat face
she was wearing a very plain indoor dress and had on a shabby hat but she still carried a parasol
unexpectedly finding the room full of people she was not so much embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness like a little child
said raskolnikov extremely astonished and he too was confused
he at once recollected that his mother and sister knew through luzhin s letter of some young woman of notorious behaviour
he had only just been protesting against luzhin s calumny and declaring that he had seen the girl last night for the first time and suddenly she had walked in
he remembered too that he had not protested against the expression of notorious behaviour
all this passed vaguely and fleetingly through his brain but looking at her more intently he saw that the humiliated creature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her
when she made a movement to retreat in terror it sent a pang to his heart
i did not expect you he said hurriedly with a look that made her stop
you come no doubt from katerina ivanovna
at sonia s entrance razumihin who had been sitting on one of raskolnikov s three chairs close to the door got up to allow her to enter
raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where zossimov had been sitting but feeling that the sofa which served him as a bed was too a place he hurriedly motioned her to razumihin s chair
you sit here he said to razumihin putting him on the sofa
sonia sat down almost shaking with terror and looked timidly at the two ladies
it was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she could sit down beside them
at the thought of it she was so frightened that she hurriedly got up again and in utter confusion addressed raskolnikov
forgive me for disturbing you she began falteringly
i come from katerina ivanovna and she had no one to send
katerina ivanovna told me to beg you to be at the service in the morning at mitrofanievsky and then to us to her to do her the honour
sonia stammered and ceased speaking
i will try certainly most certainly answered raskolnikov
he too stood up and he too faltered and could not finish his sentence
please sit down he said suddenly
you are perhaps in a hurry but please be so kind spare me two minutes and he drew up a chair for her
sonia sat down again and again timidly she took a hurried frightened look at the two ladies and dropped her eyes
raskolnikov s pale face flushed a shudder passed over him his eyes glowed
mother he said firmly and insistently this is sofya semyonovna marmeladov the daughter of that unfortunate marmeladov who was run over yesterday before my eyes and of whom i was just telling you
pulcheria alexandrovna glanced at sonia and slightly screwed up her eyes
in spite of her embarrassment before rodya s urgent and challenging look she could not deny herself that satisfaction
dounia gazed gravely and intently into the poor girl s face and scrutinised her with perplexity
sonia hearing herself introduced tried to raise her eyes again but was more embarrassed than ever
i wanted to ask you said raskolnikov hastily how things were arranged yesterday
you were not worried by the police for instance
no that was all right it was too evident the cause of death
why at the body s remaining so long
so that they will carry it to the cemetery into the chapel until
at first katerina ivanovna was unwilling but now she sees herself that it s necessary
then she begs you to do us the honour to be in the church for the service and then to be present at the funeral lunch
she told me to thank you very much for helping us yesterday
but for you we should have had nothing for the funeral
all at once her lips and chin began trembling but with an effort she controlled herself looking down again
during the conversation raskolnikov watched her carefully
she had a thin very thin pale little face rather irregular and angular with a sharp little nose and chin
she could not have been called pretty but her blue eyes were so clear and when they lighted up there was such a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help being attracted
her face and her whole figure indeed had another peculiar characteristic
in spite of her eighteen years she looked almost a little girl almost a child
and in some of her gestures this childishness seemed almost absurd
but has katerina ivanovna been able to manage with such small means
does she even mean to have a funeral lunch
raskolnikov asked persistently keeping up the conversation
the coffin will be plain of course and everything will be plain so it won t cost much
katerina ivanovna and i have reckoned it all out so that there will be enough left and katerina ivanovna was very anxious it should be so
i understand i understand of course why do you look at my room like that
my mother has just said it is like a tomb
you gave us everything yesterday sonia said suddenly in reply in a loud rapid whisper and again she looked down in confusion
her lips and chin were trembling once more
she had been struck at once by raskolnikov s poor surroundings and now these words broke out spontaneously
there was a light in dounia s eyes and even pulcheria alexandrovna looked kindly at sonia
rodya she said getting up we shall have dinner together of course
and you rodya had better go for a little walk and then rest and lie down before you come to see us
i am afraid we have exhausted you
yes yes i ll come he answered getting up fussily
but surely you will have dinner together cried razumihin looking in surprise at raskolnikov
yes yes i am coming of course of course
you do not want him just now do you mother
or perhaps i am taking him from you
and will you dmitri prokofitch do us the favour of dining with us
razumihin bowed positively radiant
for one moment they were all strangely embarrassed
pulcheria alexandrovna meant to greet sonia too but it somehow failed to come off and she went in a flutter out of the room
but avdotya romanovna seemed to await her turn and following her mother out gave sonia an attentive courteous bow
sonia in confusion gave a hurried frightened curtsy
there was a look of poignant discomfort in her face as though avdotya romanovna s courtesy and attention were oppressive and painful to her
dounia called raskolnikov in the passage
have you forgotten said dounia turning warmly and awkwardly to him
and he squeezed her fingers warmly
dounia smiled flushed pulled her hand away and went off quite happy
come that s capital he said to sonia going back and looking brightly at her
god give peace to the dead the living have still to live
sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face
he looked at her for some moments in silence
the whole history of the dead father floated before his memory in those moments
heavens dounia pulcheria alexandrovna began as soon as they were in the street i really feel relieved myself at coming away more at ease
how little did i think yesterday in the train that i could ever be glad of that
i tell you again mother he is still very ill
perhaps worrying about us upset him
we must be patient and much much can be forgiven
pulcheria alexandrovna caught her up hotly and jealously
do you know dounia i was looking at you two
you are the very portrait of him and not so much in face as in soul
you are both melancholy both morose and both haughty and both generous
surely he can t be an egoist dounia
when i think of what is in store for us this evening my heart sinks
dounia only think what a position we are in
what if pyotr petrovitch breaks it off
poor pulcheria alexandrovna blurted out incautiously
he won t be worth much if he does answered dounia sharply and contemptuously
we did well to come away pulcheria alexandrovna hurriedly broke in
he was in a hurry about some business or other
if he gets out and has a breath of air
it is fearfully close in his room
but where is one to get a breath of air here
the very streets here feel like rooms
they will crush you carrying something
why it is a piano they have got i declare how they push
i am very much afraid of that young woman too
why that sofya semyonovna who was there just now
why i have a presentiment dounia
well you may believe it or not but as soon as she came in that very minute i felt that she was the chief cause of the trouble
nothing of the sort cried dounia in vexation
what nonsense with your presentiments mother
he only made her acquaintance the evening before and he did not know her when she came in
she worries me but you will see you will see
she was gazing at me with those eyes
i could scarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her do you remember
it seems so strange but pyotr petrovitch writes like that about her and he introduces her to us to you
so he must think a great deal of her
we were talked about and written about too
i am sure that she is a good girl and that it is all nonsense
and pyotr petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer dounia snapped out suddenly
pulcheria alexandrovna was crushed the conversation was not resumed
i will tell you what i want with you said raskolnikov drawing razumihin to the window
then i will tell katerina ivanovna that you are coming sonia said hurriedly preparing to depart
i want to have another word or two with you
he turned suddenly to razumihin again
why added the latter with interest
you were speaking about it yesterday
he was inquiring for people who had pawned things and i have some pledges there too trifles a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when i left home and my father s silver watch they are only worth five or six roubles altogether
i do not want to lose the things especially the watch
i was quaking just now for fear mother would ask to look at it when we spoke of dounia s watch
it is the only thing of father s left us
she would be ill if it were lost
i know i ought to have given notice at the police station but would it not be better to go straight to porfiry
the matter might be settled more quickly
you see mother may ask for it before dinner
certainly not to the police station
certainly to porfiry razumihin shouted in extraordinary excitement
and he will be very very glad to make your acquaintance
i have often talked to him of you at different times
i was speaking of you yesterday
it is all turning out splendidly
oh yes sofya ivanovna sofya semyonovna corrected raskolnikov
sofya semyonovna this is my friend razumihin and he is a good man
if you have to go now sonia was beginning not looking at razumihin at all and still more embarrassed
i will come to you sofya semyonovna
he was not exactly ill at ease but seemed hurried and avoided her eyes
sonia gave her address and flushed as she did so
don t you lock up asked razumihin following him on to the stairs
i have been meaning to buy a lock for these two years
people are happy who have no need of locks he said laughing to sonia
they stood still in the gateway
do you go to the right sofya semyonovna
how did you find me by the way he added as though he wanted to say something quite different
he wanted to look at her soft clear eyes but this was not easy
why you gave your address to polenka yesterday
i had heard my father speak of you only i did not know your name and he did not know it
and as i had learnt your name i asked where does raskolnikov live
i did not know you had only a room too
she was extremely glad to escape at last she went away looking down hurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible to walk the twenty steps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone and then moving rapidly along looking at no one noticing nothing to think to remember to meditate on every word every detail
never never had she felt anything like this
dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was opening before her
she remembered suddenly that raskolnikov meant to come to her that day perhaps at once
she kept muttering with a sinking heart as though entreating someone like a frightened child
she was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who was watching her and following at her heels
he had accompanied her from the gateway
at the moment when razumihin raskolnikov and she stood still at parting on the pavement this gentleman who was just passing started on hearing sonia s words and i asked where raskolnikov lived
he turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three especially upon raskolnikov to whom sonia was speaking then looked back and noted the house
all this was done in an instant as he passed and trying not to betray his interest he walked on more slowly as though waiting for something
he was waiting for sonia he saw that they were parting and that sonia was going home
i ve seen that face somewhere he thought
at the turning he crossed over looked round and saw sonia coming the same way noticing nothing
he followed her on the other side
after about fifty paces he crossed over again overtook her and kept two or three yards behind her
he was a man about fifty rather tall and thickly set with broad high shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little
he wore good and fashionable clothes and looked like a gentleman of position
he carried a handsome cane which he tapped on the pavement at each step his gloves were spotless
he had a broad rather pleasant face with high and a fresh colour not often seen in petersburg
his flaxen hair was still abundant and only touched here and there with grey and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair
his eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look his lips were crimson
he was a remarkedly man and looked much younger than his years
when sonia came out on the canal bank they were the only two persons on the pavement
he observed her dreaminess and preoccupation
on reaching the house where she lodged sonia turned in at the gate he followed her seeming rather surprised
in the courtyard she turned to the right corner
bah muttered the unknown gentleman and mounted the stairs behind her
she reached the third storey turned down the passage and rang at no
on the door was inscribed in chalk kapernaumov tailor
the stranger repeated again wondering at the strange coincidence and he rang next door at no
the doors were two or three yards apart
you lodge at kapernaumov s he said looking at sonia and laughing
he altered a waistcoat for me yesterday
i am staying close here at madame resslich s
sonia looked at him attentively
we are neighbours he went on gaily
i only came to town the day before yesterday
sonia made no reply the door opened and she slipped in
she felt for some reason ashamed and uneasy
on the way to porfiry s razumihin was obviously excited
that s capital brother he repeated several times and i am glad
i didn t know that you pledged things at the old woman s too
i mean was it long since you were there
raskolnikov stopped still to recollect
two or three days before her death it must have been
but i am not going to redeem the things now he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous solicitude about the things
i ve not more than a silver rouble left after last night s accursed delirium
he laid special emphasis on the delirium
yes yes razumihin hastened to agree with what was not clear
then that s why you were stuck partly
you know in your delirium you were continually mentioning some rings or chains
that s clear it s all clear now
how that idea must have got about among them
here this man will go to the stake for me and i find him delighted at having it why i spoke of rings in my delirium
what a hold the idea must have on all of them
oh yes razumihin answered quickly
he is a nice fellow you will see brother
rather clumsy that is to say he is a man of polished manners but i mean clumsy in a different sense
he is an intelligent fellow very much so indeed but he has his own range of ideas
he is incredulous sceptical cynical he likes to impose on people or rather to make fun of them
his is the old circumstantial method
but he understands his work thoroughly
last year he cleared up a case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue
he is very very anxious to make your acquaintance
on what grounds is he so anxious
oh it s not exactly you see since you ve been ill i happen to have mentioned you several times
so when he heard about you about your being a law student and not able to finish your studies he said what a pity
from everything together not only that yesterday zametov
you know rodya i talked some nonsense on the way home to you yesterday when i was drunk
i am afraid brother of your exaggerating it you see
maybe they are right he said with a constrained smile
but all that i said and there was something else too
it was all nonsense drunken nonsense
raskolnikov cried with exaggerated irritability
if you are ashamed then don t speak of it
razumihin was more than ecstatic and raskolnikov perceived it with repulsion
he was alarmed too by what razumihin had just said about porfiry
i shall have to pull a long face with him too he thought with a beating heart and he turned white and do it naturally too
but the most natural thing would be to do nothing at all
oh well we shall see how it turns out
is it a good thing to go or not
the butterfly flies to the light
my heart is beating that s what s bad
in this grey house said razumihin
the most important thing does porfiry know that i was at the old hag s flat yesterday and asked about the blood
i must find that out instantly as soon as i go in find out from his face otherwise
i say brother he said suddenly addressing razumihin with a sly smile i have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiously excited
not a bit of it said razumihin stung to the quick
yes brother i assure you it s noticeable
why you sat on your chair in a way you never do sit on the edge somehow and you seemed to be writhing all the time
you kept jumping up for nothing
one moment you were angry and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat
you even blushed especially when you were invited to dinner you blushed awfully
but why are you wriggling out of it like a schoolboy
by jove there he s blushing again
but why are you so shamefaced about it
i ll make mother laugh and someone else too listen listen listen this is serious
razumihin was utterly overwhelmed turning cold with horror
and if only you knew how it suits you a romeo over six foot high
and how you ve washed you cleaned your nails i declare
why i do believe you ve got pomatum on your hair
raskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain himself
so laughing they entered porfiry petrovitch s flat
this is what raskolnikov wanted from within they could be heard laughing as they came in still guffawing in the passage
not a word here or i ll brain you
razumihin whispered furiously seizing raskolnikov by the shoulder
chapter v raskolnikov was already entering the room
he came in looking as though he had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again
behind him razumihin strode in gawky and awkward shamefaced and red as a peony with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression
his face and whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified raskolnikov s laughter
raskolnikov not waiting for an introduction bowed to porfiry petrovitch who stood in the middle of the room looking inquiringly at them
he held out his hand and shook hands still apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few words to introduce himself
but he had no sooner succeeded in assuming a serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as though accidentally at razumihin and could no longer control himself his stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried to restrain it
the extraordinary ferocity with which razumihin received this spontaneous mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most genuine fun and naturalness
razumihin strengthened this impression as though on purpose
you fiend he roared waving his arm which at once struck a little round table with an empty on it
everything was sent flying and crashing
you know it s a loss to the crown porfiry petrovitch quoted gaily
raskolnikov was still laughing with his hand in porfiry petrovitch s but anxious not to overdo it awaited the right moment to put a natural end to it
razumihin completely put to confusion by upsetting the table and smashing the glass gazed gloomily at the fragments cursed and turned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance seeing nothing
porfiry petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing but obviously looked for explanations
zametov had been sitting in the corner but he rose at the visitors entrance and was standing in expectation with a smile on his lips though he looked with surprise and even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at raskolnikov with a certain embarrassment
zametov s unexpected presence struck raskolnikov unpleasantly
i ve got to think of that he thought
excuse me please he began affecting extreme embarrassment
not at all very pleasant to see you and how pleasantly you ve come in
porfiry petrovitch nodded at razumihin
upon my honour i don t know why he is in such a rage with me
i only told him as we came along that he was like romeo and proved it
pig ejaculated razumihin without turning round
there must have been very grave grounds for it if he is so furious at the word porfiry laughed
damn you all snapped razumihin and suddenly bursting out laughing himself he went up to porfiry with a more cheerful face as though nothing had happened
this is my friend rodion romanovitch raskolnikov in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make your acquaintance and secondly he has a little matter of business with you
bah zametov what brought you here
what does this mean thought raskolnikov uneasily
zametov seemed taken aback but not very much so
why it was at your rooms we met yesterday he said easily
then i have been spared the trouble
all last week he was begging me to introduce him to you
porfiry and you have sniffed each other out without me
porfiry petrovitch was wearing a very clean linen and slippers
he was a man of about five and thirty short stout even to corpulence and clean shaven
he wore his hair cut short and had a large round head particularly prominent at the back
his soft round rather face was of a sickly yellowish colour but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression
it would have been except for a look in the eyes which shone with a watery mawkish light under almost white blinking eyelashes
the expression of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish figure and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at first sight
as soon as porfiry petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter of business with him he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down himself on the other end waiting for him to explain his business with that careful and attention which is at once oppressive and embarrassing especially to a stranger and especially if what you are discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such exceptional solemnity
but in brief and coherent phrases raskolnikov explained his business clearly and exactly and was so well satisfied with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at porfiry
porfiry petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him
razumihin sitting opposite at the same table listened warmly and impatiently looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive interest
fool raskolnikov swore to himself
you have to give information to the police porfiry replied with a most businesslike air that having learnt of this incident that is of the murder you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such and such things belong to you and that you desire to redeem them or but they will write to you
that s just the point that at the present moment raskolnikov tried his utmost to feign embarrassment i am not quite in funds and even this trifling sum is beyond me i only wanted you see for the present to declare that the things are mine and that when i have money
that s no matter answered porfiry petrovitch receiving his explanation of his pecuniary position coldly but you can if you prefer write straight to me to say that having been informed of the matter and claiming such and such as your property you beg
raskolnikov interrupted eagerly again interested in the financial side of the question
oh the most ordinary and suddenly porfiry petrovitch looked with obvious irony at him screwing up his eyes and as it were winking at him
but perhaps it was raskolnikov s fancy for it all lasted but a moment
there was certainly something of the sort raskolnikov could have sworn he winked at him goodness knows why
he knows flashed through his mind like lightning
forgive my troubling you about such trifles he went on a little disconcerted the things are only worth five roubles but i prize them particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me and i must confess that i was alarmed when i heard
that s why you were so much struck when i mentioned to zossimov that porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges
razumihin put in with obvious intention
raskolnikov could not help glancing at him with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes but immediately recollected himself
you seem to be jeering at me brother
he said to him with a irritability
i dare say i do seem to you absurdly anxious about such trash but you mustn t think me selfish or grasping for that and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes
i told you just now that the silver watch though it s not worth a cent is the only thing left us of my father s
you may laugh at me but my mother is here he turned suddenly to porfiry and if she knew he turned again hurriedly to razumihin carefully making his voice tremble that the watch was lost she would be in despair
quite the contrary shouted razumihin distressed
raskolnikov asked himself in a tremor
porfiry paused as though reflecting
your things would not in any case be lost he went on calmly and coldly
i have been expecting you here for some time
and as though that was a matter of no importance he carefully offered the to razumihin who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash over the carpet
raskolnikov shuddered but porfiry did not seem to be looking at him and was still concerned with razumihin s cigarette
why did you know that he had pledges cried razumihin
porfiry petrovitch addressed himself to raskolnikov
your things the ring and the watch were wrapped up together and on the paper your name was legibly written in pencil together with the date on which you left them with her
raskolnikov smiled awkwardly doing his very utmost to look him straight in the face but he failed and suddenly added i say that because i suppose there were a great many pledges that it must be difficult to remember them all
but you remember them all so clearly and and
but we know all who had pledges and you are the only one who hasn t come forward porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony
i heard indeed that you were in great distress about something
no i am quite well raskolnikov snapped out rudely and angrily completely changing his tone
his anger was mounting he could not repress it
and in my anger i shall betray myself flashed through his mind again
he was unconscious and delirious all yesterday
would you believe porfiry as soon as our backs were turned he dressed though he could hardly stand and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight delirious all the time
porfiry shook his head in a womanish way
but you don t believe it anyway raskolnikov let slip in his anger
but porfiry petrovitch did not seem to catch those strange words
but how could you have gone out if you hadn t been delirious
were you in your senses when you did it
now that all danger is over i can speak plainly
i was awfully sick of them yesterday
raskolnikov addressed porfiry suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance i ran away from them to take lodgings where they wouldn t find me and took a lot of money with me
i say zametov was i sensible or delirious yesterday settle our dispute
he could have strangled zametov at that moment so hateful were his expression and his silence to him
in my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully but you were extremely irritable zametov pronounced dryly
and nikodim fomitch was telling me put in porfiry petrovitch that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had been run over
and there said razumihin weren t you mad then
you gave your last penny to the widow for the funeral
if you wanted to help give fifteen or twenty even but keep three roubles for yourself at least but he flung away all the at once
maybe i found a treasure somewhere
so that s why i was liberal yesterday
zametov knows i ve found a treasure
excuse us please for disturbing you for half an hour with such trivialities he said turning to porfiry petrovitch with trembling lips
oh no quite the contrary quite the contrary
if only you knew how you interest me
it s interesting to look on and listen and i am really glad you have come forward at last
my throat s dry cried razumihin
perhaps we will all keep you company
wouldn t you like something more essential before tea
porfiry petrovitch went out to order tea
raskolnikov s thoughts were in a whirl
he was in terrible exasperation
the worst of it is they don t disguise it they don t care to stand on ceremony
and how if you didn t know me at all did you come to talk to nikodim fomitch about me
so they don t care to hide that they are tracking me like a pack of dogs
come strike me openly don t play with me like a cat with a mouse
it s hardly civil porfiry petrovitch but perhaps i won t allow it
i shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly faces and you ll see how i despise you
what if i am mistaken and through inexperience i get angry and don t keep up my nasty part
all their phrases are the usual ones but there is something about them
it all might be said but there is something
why did he say bluntly with her
why did zametov add that i spoke artfully
razumihin is sitting here why does he see nothing
that innocent blockhead never does see anything
did porfiry wink at me just now
are they trying to upset my nerves or are they teasing me
either it s ill fancy or they know
i foresaw he would change his mind
he is at home here while it s my first visit
porfiry does not consider him a visitor sits with his back to him
they re as thick as thieves no doubt over me
not a doubt they were talking about me before we came
when i said that i ran away to take a flat he let it pass
i put that in cleverly about a flat it may be of use afterwards
he didn t know of my mother s arrival
the hag had written the date on in pencil
you are wrong you won t catch me
the flat even isn t a fact but delirium
but my being angry now maybe is a fact
perhaps that s right to play the invalid
all this flashed like lightning through his mind
porfiry petrovitch returned quickly
your party yesterday brother has left my head rather
and i am out of sorts altogether he began in quite a different tone laughing to razumihin
i left you yesterday at the most interesting point
they got on to everlasting questions floated off into space
only fancy rodya what we got on to yesterday
whether there is such a thing as crime
i told you that we talked our heads off
it s an everyday social question raskolnikov answered casually
the question wasn t put quite like that observed porfiry
not quite that s true razumihin agreed at once getting warm and hurried as usual
listen rodion and tell us your opinion i want to hear it
i was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to help me
it began with the socialist doctrine
you know their doctrine crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more and nothing more no other causes admitted
you are wrong there cried porfiry petrovitch he was noticeably animated and kept laughing as he looked at razumihin which made him more excited than ever
nothing is admitted razumihin interrupted with heat
everything with them is the influence of environment and nothing else
from which it follows that if society is normally organised all crime will cease at once since there will be nothing to protest against and all men will become righteous in one instant
human nature is not taken into account it is excluded it s not supposed to exist
they don t recognise that humanity developing by a historical living process will become at last a normal society but they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant quicker than any living process
that s why they instinctively dislike history nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it and they explain it all as stupidity
that s why they so dislike the process of life they don t want a
the living soul demands life the soul won t obey the rules of mechanics the soul is an object of suspicion the soul is retrograde
but what they want though it smells of death and can be made of at least is not alive has no will is servile and won t revolt
and it comes in the end to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning of rooms and passages in a phalanstery
the phalanstery is ready indeed but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery it wants life it hasn t completed its vital process it s too soon for the graveyard
you can t skip over nature by logic
logic presupposes three possibilities but there are millions
cut away a million and reduce it all to the question of comfort
that s the easiest solution of the problem
it s seductively clear and you musn t think about it
that s the great thing you mustn t think
the whole secret of life in two pages of print
can you imagine he turned to raskolnikov six people holding forth like that last night in one room with punch as a preliminary
no brother you are wrong environment accounts for a great deal in crime i can assure you of that
oh i know it does but just tell me a man of forty violates a child of ten was it environment drove him to it
well strictly speaking it did porfiry observed with noteworthy gravity a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the influence of environment
razumihin was almost in a frenzy
i ll prove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the church of ivan the great s being two hundred and fifty feet high and i will prove it clearly exactly progressively and even with a liberal tendency
let s hear please how he will prove it
he is always humbugging confound him cried razumihin jumping up and gesticulating
what s the use of talking to you
he does all that on purpose you don t know him rodion
he took their side yesterday simply to make fools of them
and the things he said yesterday
he can keep it up for a fortnight together
last year he persuaded us that he was going into a monastery he stuck to it for two months
not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going to get married that he had everything ready for the wedding
we all began to congratulate him
there was no bride nothing all pure fantasy
it was the new clothes in fact that made me think of taking you in
you wouldn t have supposed it eh
wait a bit i shall take you in too
all these questions about crime environment children recall to my mind an article of yours which interested me at the time
on crime or something of the sort i forget the title i read it with pleasure two months ago in the
raskolnikov asked in astonishment
i certainly did write an article upon a book six months ago when i left the university but i sent it to the
and the ceased to exist so that s why it wasn t printed at the time
that s true but when it ceased to exist the was amalgamated with the and so your article appeared two months ago in the latter
why you might get some money out of them for the article
you lead such a solitary life that you know nothing of matters that concern you directly
i knew nothing about it either cried razumihin
i ll run to the and ask for the number
it doesn t matter though i will find it
how did you find out that the article was mine
it s only signed with an initial
i only learnt it by chance the other day
i analysed if i remember the psychology of a criminal before and after the crime
yes and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always accompanied by illness
very very original but it was not that part of your article that interested me so much but an idea at the end of the article which i regret to say you merely suggested without working it out clearly
there is if you recollect a suggestion that there are certain persons who can that is not precisely are able to but have a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes and that the law is not for them
raskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his idea
but not because of the influence of environment
razumihin inquired with some alarm even
no not exactly because of it answered porfiry
in his article all men are divided into ordinary and extraordinary
ordinary men have to live in submission have no right to transgress the law because don t you see they are ordinary
but extraordinary men have a right to commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way just because they are extraordinary
that was your idea if i am not mistaken
razumihin muttered in bewilderment
he saw the point at once and knew where they wanted to drive him
he decided to take up the challenge
that wasn t quite my contention he began simply and modestly
yet i admit that you have stated it almost correctly perhaps if you like perfectly so
it almost gave him pleasure to admit this
the only difference is that i don t contend that extraordinary people are always bound to commit breaches of morals as you call it
in fact i doubt whether such an argument could be published
i simply hinted that an extraordinary man has the right that is not an official right but an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep certain obstacles and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment of his idea sometimes perhaps of benefit to the whole of humanity
you say that my article isn t definite i am ready to make it as clear as i can
perhaps i am right in thinking you want me to very well
i maintain that if the discoveries of kepler and newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one a dozen a hundred or more men newton would have had the right would indeed have been in to the dozen or the hundred men for the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity
but it does not follow from that that newton had a right to murder people right and left and to steal every day in the market
then i remember i maintain in my article that all
well legislators and leaders of men such as lycurgus solon mahomet napoleon and so on were all without exception criminals from the very fact that making a new law they transgressed the ancient one handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the people and they did not stop short at bloodshed either if that bloodshed often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence of ancient law were of use to their cause
it s remarkable in fact that the majority indeed of these benefactors and leaders of humanity were guilty of terrible carnage
in short i maintain that all great men or even men a little out of the common that is to say capable of giving some new word must from their very nature be criminals more or less of course
otherwise it s hard for them to get out of the common rut and to remain in the common rut is what they can t submit to from their very nature again and to my mind they ought not indeed to submit to it
you see that there is nothing particularly new in all that
the same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before
as for my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary i acknowledge that it s somewhat arbitrary but i don t insist upon exact numbers
i only believe in my leading idea that men are divided by a law of nature into two categories inferior ordinary that is so to say material that serves only to reproduce its kind and men who have the gift or the talent to utter
there are of course innumerable but the distinguishing features of both categories are fairly well marked
the first category generally speaking are men conservative in temperament and they live under control and love to be controlled
to my thinking it is their duty to be controlled because that s their vocation and there is nothing humiliating in it for them
the second category all transgress the law they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their capacities
the crimes of these men are of course relative and varied for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the present for the sake of the better
but if such a one is forced for the sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood he can i maintain find within himself in his conscience a sanction for wading through blood that depends on the idea and its dimensions note that
it s only in that sense i speak of their right to crime in my article you remember it began with the legal question
there s no need for such anxiety however the masses will scarcely ever admit this right they punish them or hang them more or less and in doing so fulfil quite justly their conservative vocation
but the same masses set these criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them more or less
the first category is always the man of the present the second the man of the future
the first preserve the world and people it the second move the world and lead it to its goal
each class has an equal right to exist
in fact all have equal rights with me and la guerre till the new jerusalem of course
then you believe in the new jerusalem do you
i do raskolnikov answered firmly as he said these words and during the whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet
i do repeated raskolnikov raising his eyes to porfiry
and do you believe in lazarus rising from the dead
but let us go back to the question they are not always executed
some on the contrary triumph in their lifetime
oh yes some attain their ends in this life and then
they begin executing other people
if it s necessary indeed for the most part they do
but tell me this how do you distinguish those extraordinary people from the ordinary ones
i feel there ought to be more exactitude more external definition
excuse the natural anxiety of a practical citizen but couldn t they adopt a special uniform for instance couldn t they wear something be branded in some way
for you know if confusion arises and a member of one category imagines that he belongs to the other begins to eliminate obstacles as you so happily expressed it then
that remark is wittier than the other
no reason to but take note that the mistake can only arise in the first category that is among the ordinary people as i perhaps unfortunately called them
in spite of their predisposition to obedience very many of them through a playfulness of nature sometimes vouchsafed even to the cow like to imagine themselves advanced people destroyers and to push themselves into the new movement and this quite sincerely
people are very often unobserved by them or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling tendencies
but i don t think there is any considerable danger here and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far
of course they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away with them and to teach them their place but no more in fact even this isn t necessary as they castigate themselves for they are very conscientious some perform this service for one another and others chastise themselves with their own hands
they will impose various public acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying effect in fact you ve nothing to be uneasy about
well you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score but there s another thing worries me
tell me please are there many people who have the right to kill others these extraordinary people
i am ready to bow down to them of course but you must admit it s alarming if there are a great many of them eh
oh you needn t worry about that either raskolnikov went on in the same tone
people with new ideas people with the faintest capacity for saying something are extremely few in number extraordinarily so in fact
one thing only is clear that the appearance of all these grades and of men must follow with unfailing regularity some law of nature
that law of course is unknown at present but i am convinced that it exists and one day may become known
the vast mass of mankind is mere material and only exists in order by some great effort by some mysterious process by means of some crossing of races and stocks to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence
one in ten thousand perhaps i speak roughly approximately is born with some independence and with still greater independence one in a hundred thousand
the man of genius is one of millions and the great geniuses the crown of humanity appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions
in fact i have not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place
but there certainly is and must be a definite law it can not be a matter of chance
there you sit making fun of one another
raskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply
and the unconcealed persistent nervous and sarcasm of porfiry seemed strange to razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face
well brother if you are really serious
you are right of course in saying that it s not new that it s like what we ve read and heard a thousand times already but what is really original in all this and is exclusively your own to my horror is that you sanction bloodshed the name of and excuse my saying so with such fanaticism
that i take it is the point of your article
but that sanction of bloodshed is to my mind more terrible than the official legal sanction of bloodshed
you are quite right it is more terrible porfiry agreed
there is some mistake i shall read it
all that is not in the article there s only a hint of it said raskolnikov
your attitude to crime is pretty clear to me now but excuse me for my impertinence i am really ashamed to be worrying you like this you see you ve removed my anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed but there are various practical possibilities that make me uneasy
what if some man or youth imagines that he is a lycurgus or mahomet a future one of course and suppose he begins to remove all obstacles
he has some great enterprise before him and needs money for it and tries to get it
zametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner
raskolnikov did not even raise his eyes to him
i must admit he went on calmly that such cases certainly must arise
the vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that snare young people especially
raskolnikov smiled in reply that s not my fault
he said just now he nodded at razumihin that i sanction bloodshed
society is too well protected by prisons banishment criminal investigators penal servitude
you have but to catch the thief
if he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake
that will be his punishment as well as the prison
but the real geniuses asked razumihin frowning those who have the right to murder
oughtn t they to suffer at all even for the blood they ve shed
it s not a matter of permission or prohibition
he will suffer if he is sorry for his victim
pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart
the really great men must i think have great sadness on earth he added dreamily not in the tone of the conversation
he raised his eyes looked earnestly at them all smiled and took his cap
he was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance and he felt this
well you may abuse me be angry with me if you like porfiry petrovitch began again but i can t resist
allow me one little question i know i am troubling you
there is just one little notion i want to express simply that i may not forget it
very good tell me your little notion raskolnikov stood waiting pale and grave before him
i really don t know how to express it properly
it s a playful psychological idea
when you were writing your article surely you couldn t have helped
fancying yourself just a little an extraordinary man uttering a in your sense
quite possibly raskolnikov answered contemptuously
and if so could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties and hardship or for some service to humanity to overstep obstacles
and again he winked with his left eye and laughed noiselessly just as before
if i did i certainly should not tell you raskolnikov answered with defiant and haughty contempt
no i was only interested on account of your article from a literary point of view
foo how obvious and insolent that is
raskolnikov thought with repulsion
allow me to observe he answered dryly that i don t consider myself a mahomet or a napoleon nor any personage of that kind and not being one of them i can not tell you how i should act
oh come don t we all think ourselves napoleons now in russia
porfiry petrovitch said with alarming familiarity
something peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice
perhaps it was one of these future napoleons who did for alyona ivanovna last week
zametov blurted out from the corner
raskolnikov did not speak but looked firmly and intently at porfiry
razumihin was scowling gloomily
he seemed before this to be noticing something
there was a minute of gloomy silence
porfiry said amiably holding out his hand with excessive politeness
very very glad of your acquaintance
as for your request have no uneasiness write just as i told you or better still come to me there yourself in a day or two indeed
i shall be there at eleven o clock for certain
we ll arrange it all we ll have a talk
as one of the last to be you might perhaps be able to tell us something he added with a most expression
you want to me officially in due form
that s not necessary for the present
i lose no opportunity you see and
i ve talked with all who had pledges
i obtained evidence from some of them and you are the last
yes by the way he cried seemingly suddenly delighted i just remember what was i thinking of
he turned to razumihin you were talking my ears off about that nikolay of course i know i know very well he turned to raskolnikov that the fellow is innocent but what is one to do
this is the point this is all when you went up the stairs it was past seven wasn t it
yes answered raskolnikov with an unpleasant sensation at the very moment he spoke that he need not have said it
then when you went upstairs between seven and eight didn t you see in a flat that stood open on a second storey do you remember
two workmen or at least one of them
they were painting there didn t you notice them
it s very very important for them
no i didn t see them raskolnikov answered slowly as though ransacking his memory while at the same instant he was racking every nerve almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything
no i didn t see them and i don t think i noticed a flat like that open
but on the fourth storey he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant i remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite alyona ivanovna s
some porters were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall
no i don t remember that there were any painters and i don t think that there was a flat open anywhere no there wasn t
razumihin shouted suddenly as though he had reflected and realised
why it was on the day of the murder the painters were at work and he was there three days before
porfiry slapped himself on the forehead
this business is turning my brain
he addressed raskolnikov somewhat apologetically
it would be such a great thing for us to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at the flat so i fancied you could perhaps have told us something
then you should be more careful razumihin observed grimly
the last words were uttered in the passage
porfiry petrovitch saw them to the door with excessive politeness
they went out into the street gloomy and sullen and for some steps they did not say a word
chapter vi i don t believe it i can t believe it
repeated razumihin trying in perplexity to refute raskolnikov s arguments
they were by now approaching bakaleyev s lodgings where pulcheria alexandrovna and dounia had been expecting them a long while
razumihin kept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion confused and excited by the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about
don t believe it then answered raskolnikov with a cold careless smile
you were noticing nothing as usual but i was weighing every word
that is why you weighed their words h m
certainly i agree porfiry s tone was rather strange and still more that wretch zametov
you are right there was something about him but why
why he has changed his mind since last night
if they had that brainless idea they would do their utmost to hide it and conceal their cards so as to catch you afterwards
but it was all impudent and careless
if they had had facts i mean real facts or at least grounds for suspicion then they would certainly have tried to hide their game in the hope of getting more they would have made a search long ago besides
so they try to throw me out by impudence
and perhaps he was irritated at having no facts and blurted it out in his vexation or perhaps he has some plan
perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to know
they have a psychology of their own brother
but it is loathsome explaining it all
but since we have spoken openly now and it is an excellent thing that we have at last i am glad
i will own now frankly that i noticed it in them long ago this idea
of course the merest hint only an insinuation but why an insinuation even
if only you knew how furious i have been
simply because a poor student unhinged by poverty and hypochondria on the eve of a severe delirious illness note that suspicious vain proud who has not seen a soul to speak to for six months in rags and in boots without soles has to face some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence and the unexpected debt thrust under his nose the presented by tchebarov the new paint thirty degrees reaumur and a stifling atmosphere a crowd of people the talk about the murder of a person where he had been just before and all that on an empty stomach he might well have a fainting fit
and that that is what they found it all on
i understand how annoying it is but in your place rodya i would laugh at them or better still spit in their ugly faces and spit a dozen times in all directions
i d hit out in all directions neatly too and so i d put an end to it
he really has put it well though raskolnikov thought
must i really enter into explanations with them
i feel vexed as it is that i condescended to speak to zametov yesterday in the restaurant
i will squeeze it out of him as one of the family he must let me know the ins and outs of it all
and as for zametov at last he sees through him
stay cried razumihin seizing him by the shoulder again
you say that the question about the workmen was a trap
but if you had done could you have said you had seen them painting the flat and the workmen
on the contrary you would have seen nothing even if you had seen it
who would own it against himself
if i had done i should certainly have said that i had seen the workmen and the flat raskolnikov answered with reluctance and obvious disgust
because only peasants or the most inexperienced novices deny everything flatly at examinations
if a man is ever so little developed and experienced he will certainly try to admit all the external facts that can t be avoided but will seek other explanations of them will introduce some special unexpected turn that will give them another significance and put them in another light
porfiry might well reckon that i should be sure to answer so and say i had seen them to give an air of truth and then make some explanation
but he would have told you at once that the workmen could not have been there two days before and that therefore you must have been there on the day of the murder at eight o clock
and so he would have caught you over a detail
yes that is what he was reckoning on that i should not have time to reflect and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer and so would forget that the workmen could not have been there two days before
it is in just such stupid things clever people are most easily caught
the more cunning a man is the less he suspects that he will be caught in a simple thing
the more cunning a man is the simpler the trap he must be caught in
porfiry is not such a fool as you think
he is a knave then if that is so
raskolnikov could not help laughing
but at the very moment he was struck by the strangeness of his own frankness and the eagerness with which he had made this explanation though he had kept up all the preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion obviously with a motive from necessity
i am getting a relish for certain aspects
but almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy as though an unexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him
his uneasiness kept on increasing
they had just reached the entrance to bakaleyev s
say what you like i will come with you
he screamed with such bitter irritation such despair in his eyes that razumihin s hands dropped
he stood for some time on the steps looking gloomily at raskolnikov striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging
at last gritting his teeth and clenching his fist he swore he would squeeze porfiry like a lemon that very day and went up the stairs to reassure pulcheria alexandrovna who was by now alarmed at their long absence
when raskolnikov got home his hair was soaked with sweat and he was breathing heavily
he went rapidly up the stairs walked into his unlocked room and at once fastened the latch
then in senseless terror he rushed to the corner to that hole under the paper where he had put the things put his hand in and for some minutes felt carefully in the hole in every crack and fold of the paper
finding nothing he got up and drew a deep breath
as he was reaching the steps of bakaleyev s he suddenly fancied that something a chain a stud or even a bit of paper in which they had been wrapped with the old woman s handwriting on it might somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack and then might suddenly turn up as unexpected conclusive evidence against him
he stood as though lost in thought and a strange humiliated half senseless smile strayed on his lips
he took his cap at last and went quietly out of the room
he went dreamily through the gateway
here he is himself shouted a loud voice
the porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointing him out to a short man who looked like an artisan wearing a long coat and a waistcoat and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman
he stooped and his head in a greasy cap hung forward
from his wrinkled flabby face he looked over fifty his little eyes were lost in fat and they looked out grimly sternly and discontentedly
raskolnikov asked going up to the porter
the man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him attentively deliberately then he turned slowly and went out of the gate into the street without saying a word
why he there was asking whether a student lived here mentioned your name and whom you lodged with
i saw you coming and pointed you out and he went away
the porter too seemed rather puzzled but not much so and after wondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room
raskolnikov ran after the stranger and at once caught sight of him walking along the other side of the street with the same even deliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground as though in meditation
he soon overtook him but for some time walked behind him
at last moving on to a level with him he looked at his face
the man noticed him at once looked at him quickly but dropped his eyes again and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word
you were inquiring for me of the porter
raskolnikov said at last but in a curiously quiet voice
the man made no answer he didn t even look at him
why do you come and ask for me and say nothing
raskolnikov s voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words clearly
the man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at raskolnikov
he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice
raskolnikov went on walking beside him
his legs felt suddenly weak a cold shiver ran down his spine and his heart seemed to stand still for a moment then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free
so they walked for about a hundred paces side by side in silence
muttered raskolnikov hardly audibly
are a murderer the man answered still more articulately and emphatically with a smile of triumphant hatred and again he looked straight into raskolnikov s pale face and stricken eyes
the man turned to the left without looking behind him
raskolnikov remained standing gazing after him
he saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still standing there
raskolnikov could not see clearly but he fancied that he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph
with slow faltering steps with shaking knees raskolnikov made his way back to his little garret feeling chilled all over
he took off his cap and put it on the table and for ten minutes he stood without moving
then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he stretched himself on it
some thoughts or fragments of thoughts some images without order or coherence floated before his mind faces of people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once whom he would never have recalled the belfry of the church at the billiard table in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards the smell of cigars in some underground tobacco shop a tavern room a back staircase quite dark all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with and the sunday bells floating in from somewhere
the images followed one another whirling like a hurricane
some of them he liked and tried to clutch at but they faded and all the while there was an oppression within him but it was not overwhelming sometimes it was even pleasant
the slight shivering still persisted but that too was an almost pleasant sensation
he heard the hurried footsteps of razumihin he closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep
razumihin opened the door and stood for some time in the doorway as though hesitating then he stepped softly into the room and went cautiously to the sofa
raskolnikov heard nastasya s whisper don t disturb him
both withdrew carefully and closed the door
raskolnikov opened his eyes turned on his back again clasping his hands behind his head
who is that man who sprang out of the earth
he has seen it all that s clear
why has he only now sprung out of the earth
hm continued raskolnikov turning cold and shivering and the jewel case nikolay found behind the door was that possible
you miss an infinitesimal line and you can build it into a pyramid of evidence
he felt with sudden loathing how weak how physically weak he had become
i ought to have known it he thought with a bitter smile
and how dared i knowing myself knowing how i should be take up an axe and shed blood
i ought to have known beforehand
at times he came to a standstill at some thought
the real to whom all is permitted storms toulon makes a massacre in paris an army in egypt half a million men in the moscow expedition and gets off with a jest at vilna
and altars are set up to him after his death and so is permitted
no such people it seems are not of flesh but of bronze
one sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh
napoleon the pyramids waterloo and a wretched skinny old woman a pawnbroker with a red trunk under her bed it s a nice hash for porfiry petrovitch to digest
a napoleon creep under an old woman s bed
at moments he felt he was raving
he sank into a state of feverish excitement
the old woman is of no consequence he thought hotly and incoherently
the old woman was a mistake perhaps but she is not what matters
the old woman was only an illness
i didn t kill a human being but a principle
i killed the principle but i didn t overstep i stopped on this side
and it seems i wasn t even capable of that
why was that fool razumihin abusing the socialists
they are industrious commercial people the happiness of all is their case
no life is only given to me once
and i shall never have it again i don t want to wait for the happiness of all
i want to live myself or else better not live at all
i simply couldn t pass by my mother starving keeping my rouble in my pocket while i waited for the happiness of all
i am putting my little brick into the happiness of all and so my heart is at peace
ech i am an √¶sthetic louse and nothing more he added suddenly laughing like a madman
yes i am certainly a louse he went on clutching at the idea gloating over it and playing with it with vindictive pleasure
in the first place because i can reason that i am one and secondly because for a month past i have been troubling benevolent providence calling it to witness that not for my own fleshly lusts did i undertake it but with a grand and noble object
thirdly because i aimed at carrying it out as justly as possible weighing measuring and calculating
of all the lice i picked out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as i needed for the first step no more nor less so the rest would have gone to a monastery according to her will
and what shows that i am utterly a louse he added grinding his teeth is that i am perhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse i killed and felt that i should tell myself so killing her
can anything be compared with the horror of that
i understand the prophet with his sabre on his steed allah commands and trembling creation must obey
the prophet is right he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain
it s for you to obey trembling creation and not have for that s not for you
i shall never never forgive the old woman
his hair was soaked with sweat his quivering lips were parched his eyes were fixed on the ceiling
yes i hate them i feel a physical hatred for them i can t bear them near me
i went up to my mother and kissed her i remember
to embrace her and think if she only knew
must be the same as i am he added straining himself to think as it were struggling with delirium
ah how i hate the old woman now
i feel i should kill her again if she came to life
it s strange though why is it i scarcely ever think of her as though i hadn t killed her
poor gentle things with gentle eyes
he lost consciousness it seemed strange to him that he didn t remember how he got into the street
the twilight had fallen and the full moon was shining more and more brightly but there was a peculiar breathlessness in the air
there were crowds of people in the street workmen and business people were making their way home other people had come out for a walk there was a smell of mortar dust and stagnant water
raskolnikov walked along mournful and anxious he was distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose of having to do something in a hurry but what it was he had forgotten
suddenly he stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street beckoning to him
he crossed over to him but at once the man turned and walked away with his head hanging as though he had made no sign to him
raskolnikov wondered but he tried to overtake him
when he was within ten paces he recognised him and was frightened it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long coat
raskolnikov followed him at a distance his heart was beating they went down a turning the man still did not look round
does he know i am following him thought raskolnikov
the man went into the gateway of a big house
raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in to see whether he would look round and sign to him
in the the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him
raskolnikov at once followed him into the yard but the man was gone
he must have gone up the first staircase
he heard slow measured steps two flights above
the staircase seemed strangely familiar
he reached the window on the first floor the moon shone through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light then he reached the second floor
this is the flat where the painters were at work
but how was it he did not recognise it at once
the steps of the man above had died away
so he must have stopped or hidden somewhere
he reached the third storey should he go on
there was a stillness that was dreadful
the sound of his own footsteps scared and frightened him
the man must be hiding in some corner here
the flat was standing wide open he hesitated and went in
it was very dark and empty in the passage as though everything had been removed he crept on tiptoe into the parlour which was flooded with moonlight
everything there was as before the chairs the the yellow sofa and the pictures in the frames
a huge round moon looked in at the windows
it s the moon that makes it so still weaving some mystery thought raskolnikov
he stood and waited waited a long while and the more silent the moonlight the more violently his heart beat till it was painful
suddenly he heard a momentary sharp crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again
a fly flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz
at that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall
he thought it wasn t there before
he went up to it quietly and felt that there was someone hiding behind it
he cautiously moved the cloak and saw sitting on a chair in the corner the old woman bent double so that he couldn t see her face but it was she
he stealthily took the axe from the noose and struck her one blow then another on the skull
but strange to say she did not stir as though she were made of wood
he was frightened bent down nearer and tried to look at her but she too bent her head lower
he bent right down to the ground and peeped up into her face from below he peeped and turned cold with horror the old woman was sitting and laughing shaking with noiseless laughter doing her utmost that he should not hear it
suddenly he fancied that the door from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and whispering within
he was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the old woman on the head with all his force but at every blow of the axe the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old woman was simply shaking with mirth
he was rushing away but the passage was full of people the doors of the flats stood open and on the landing on the stairs and everywhere below there were people rows of heads all looking but huddled together in silence and expectation
something gripped his heart his legs were rooted to the spot they would not move
he drew a deep breath but his dream seemed strangely to persist his door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the doorway watching him intently
raskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them again
he lay on his back without stirring
he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly perceptibly the stranger was standing in the same place still watching him
he stepped cautiously into the room carefully closing the door after him went up to the table paused a moment still keeping his eyes on raskolnikov and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa he put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane and his chin on his hands
it was evident that he was prepared to wait indefinitely
as far as raskolnikov could make out from his stolen glances he was a man no longer young stout with a full fair almost whitish beard
it was still light but beginning to get dusk
there was complete stillness in the room
not a sound came from the stairs
only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane
raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa
i knew you were not asleep but only pretending the stranger answered oddly laughing calmly
arkady ivanovitch svidriga√Ølov allow me to introduce myself
part iv chapter i can this be still a dream
he looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor
he said at last aloud in bewilderment
his visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation
i ve come to you for two reasons
in the first place i wanted to make your personal acquaintance as i have already heard a great deal about you that is interesting and flattering secondly i cherish the hope that you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the welfare of your sister avdotya romanovna
for without your support she might not let me come near her now for she is prejudiced against me but with your assistance i reckon on
you reckon wrongly interrupted raskolnikov
they only arrived yesterday may i ask you
i only arrived myself the day before
well let me tell you this rodion romanovitch i don t consider it necessary to justify myself but kindly tell me what was there particularly criminal on my part in all this business speaking without prejudice with common sense
raskolnikov continued to look at him in silence
that in my own house i persecuted a defenceless girl and insulted her with my infamous proposals is that it
but you ve only to assume that i too am a man nihil
in a word that i am capable of being attracted and falling in love which does not depend on our will then everything can be explained in the most natural manner
the question is am i a monster or am i myself a victim
in proposing to the object of my passion to elope with me to america or switzerland i may have cherished the deepest respect for her and may have thought that i was promoting our mutual happiness
reason is the slave of passion you know why probably i was doing more harm to myself than anyone
but that s not the point raskolnikov interrupted with disgust
it s simply that whether you are right or wrong we dislike you
we don t want to have anything to do with you
svidriga√Ølov broke into a sudden laugh
but there s no getting round you he said laughing in the frankest way
i hoped to get round you but you took up the right line at once
but you are trying to get round me still
what of it cried svidriga√Ølov laughing openly
but this is what the french call and the most innocent form of deception
but still you have interrupted me one way or another i repeat again there would never have been any unpleasantness except for what happened in the garden
marfa petrovna you have got rid of marfa petrovna too so they say
but as for your question i really don t know what to say though my own conscience is quite at rest on that score
don t suppose that i am in any apprehension about it
all was regular and in order the medical inquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy dinner and a bottle of wine and indeed it could have proved nothing else
but i ll tell you what i have been thinking to myself of late on my way here in the train especially didn t
i contribute to all that calamity morally in a way by irritation or something of the sort
but i came to the conclusion that that too was quite out of the question
i wonder you trouble yourself about it
only consider i struck her just twice with a switch there were no marks even don t regard me as a cynic please i am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that but i know for certain too that marfa petrovna was very likely pleased at my so to say warmth
the story of your sister had been wrung out to the last drop for the last three days marfa petrovna had been forced to sit at home she had nothing to show herself with in the town
besides she had bored them so with that letter you heard about her reading the letter
and all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven
her first act was to order the carriage to be got out
not to speak of the fact that there are cases when women are very very glad to be insulted in spite of all their show of indignation
there are instances of it with everyone human beings in general indeed greatly love to be insulted have you noticed that
but it s particularly so with women
one might even say it s their only amusement
at one time raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so finishing the interview
but some curiosity and even a sort of prudence made him linger for a moment
no not very svidriga√Ølov answered calmly
and marfa petrovna and i scarcely ever fought
we lived very harmoniously and she was always pleased with me
i only used the whip twice in all our seven years not counting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character
the first time two months after our marriage immediately after we arrived in the country and the last time was that of which we are speaking
did you suppose i was such a monster such a reactionary such a slave driver
by the way do you remember rodion romanovitch how a few years ago in those days of beneficent publicity a nobleman i ve forgotten his name was put to shame everywhere in all the papers for having thrashed a german woman in the railway train
it was in those days that very year i believe the disgraceful action of the took place you know the egyptian nights that public reading you remember
ah the golden days of our youth where are they
well as for the gentleman who thrashed the german i feel no sympathy with him because after all what need is there for sympathy
but i must say that there are sometimes such provoking germans that i don t believe there is a progressive who could quite answer for himself
no one looked at the subject from that point of view then but that s the truly humane point of view i assure you
after saying this svidriga√Ølov broke into a sudden laugh again
raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in his mind and able to keep it to himself
i expect you ve not talked to anyone for some days he asked
i suppose you are wondering at my being such an adaptable man
no i am only wondering at your being too adaptable a man
because i am not offended at the rudeness of your questions
as you asked so i answered he replied with a surprising expression of simplicity
you know there s hardly anything i take interest in he went on as it were dreamily especially now i ve nothing to do
you are quite at liberty to imagine though that i am making up to you with a motive particularly as i told you i want to see your sister about something
but i ll confess frankly i am very much bored
the last three days especially so i am delighted to see you
don t be angry rodion romanovitch but you seem to be somehow awfully strange yourself
say what you like there s something wrong with you and now too not this very minute i mean but now generally
well well i won t i won t don t scowl
i am not such a bear you know as you think
raskolnikov looked gloomily at him
you are not a bear perhaps at all he said
i fancy indeed that you are a man of very good breeding or at least know how on occasion to behave like one
i am not particularly interested in anyone s opinion svidriga√Ølov answered dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness and therefore why not be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our climate and especially if one has a natural propensity that way he added laughing again
but i ve heard you have many friends here
you are as they say not without connections
what can you want with me then unless you ve some special object
that s true that i have friends here svidriga√Ølov admitted not replying to the chief point
i ve been lounging about for the last three days and i ve seen them or they ve seen me
i am well dressed and reckoned not a poor man the emancipation of the serfs hasn t affected me my property consists chiefly of forests and water meadows
the revenue has not fallen off but i am not going to see them i was sick of them long ago
i ve been here three days and have called on no one
how has it come into existence among us tell me that
a town of officials and students of all sorts
yes there s a great deal i didn t notice when i was here eight years ago kicking up my heels
my only hope now is in anatomy by jove it is
but as for these clubs dussauts parades or progress indeed maybe well all that can go on without me he went on again without noticing the question
besides who wants to be a why have you been a then
there was a regular set of us men of the best society eight years ago we had a fine time
and all men of breeding you know poets men of property
and indeed as a rule in our russian society the best manners are found among those who ve been thrashed have you noticed that
i ve deteriorated in the country
but i did get into prison for debt through a low greek who came from nezhin
then marfa petrovna turned up she bargained with him and bought me off for thirty thousand silver pieces i owed seventy thousand
we were united in lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure
you know she was five years older than i
for seven years i never left the country
and take note that all my life she held a document over me the iou for thirty thousand roubles so if i were to elect to be restive about anything i should be trapped at once
women find nothing incompatible in that
if it hadn t been for that would you have given her the slip
it was scarcely the document restrained me
i didn t want to go anywhere else
marfa petrovna herself invited me to go abroad seeing i was bored but i ve been abroad before and always felt sick there
for no reason but the sunrise the bay of naples the sea you look at them and it makes you sad
what s most revolting is that one is really sad
here at least one blames others for everything and excuses oneself
i should have gone perhaps on an expedition to the north pole because ai le vin and hate drinking and there s nothing left but wine
but i say i ve been told berg is going up in a great balloon next sunday from the yusupov garden and will take up passengers at a fee
no oh no muttered svidriga√Ølov really seeming to be deep in thought
no the document didn t restrain me svidriga√Ølov went on meditatively
it was my own doing not leaving the country and nearly a year ago marfa petrovna gave me back the document on my and made me a present of a considerable sum of money too
you see how i trust you arkady ivanovitch that was actually her expression
but do you know i managed the estate quite decently they know me in the neighbourhood
marfa petrovna at first approved but afterwards she was afraid of my
you seem to be missing marfa petrovna very much missing her
and by the way do you believe in ghosts
svidriga√Ølov looked at him rather oddly
marfa petrovna is pleased to visit me he said twisting his mouth into a strange smile
how do you mean she is pleased to visit you
i saw her first on the very day of the funeral an hour after she was buried
it was the day before i left to come here
the second time was the day before yesterday at daybreak on the journey at the station of malaya vishera and the third time was two hours ago in the room where i am staying
she comes speaks to me for a minute and goes out at the door always at the door
what made me think that something of the sort must be happening to you
at the same moment he was surprised at having said it
svidriga√Ølov asked in astonishment
i say that there was something in common between us eh
raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat
when i came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut pretending i said to myself at once here s the man
what are you talking about cried raskolnikov
svidriga√Ølov muttered ingenuously as though he too were puzzled
they stared in each other s faces
raskolnikov shouted with vexation
what does she say when she comes to you
would you believe it she talks of the silliest trifles and man is a strange creature it makes me angry
the first time she came in i was tired you know the funeral service the funeral ceremony the lunch afterwards
at last i was left alone in my study
i lighted a cigar and began to think she came in at the door
you ve been so busy arkady ivanovitch you have forgotten to wind the clock she said
all those seven years i ve wound that clock every week
and if i forgot it she would always remind me
the next day i set off on my way here
i got out at the station at daybreak i d been asleep tired out with my eyes half open i was drinking some coffee
i looked up and there was suddenly marfa petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of cards in her hands
shall i tell your fortune for the journey arkady ivanovitch
she was a great hand at telling fortunes
i shall never forgive myself for not asking her to
i ran away in a fright and besides the bell rang
i was sitting feeling very heavy after a miserable dinner from a cookshop i was sitting smoking all of a sudden marfa petrovna again
she came in very smart in a new green silk dress with a long train
aniska was a dressmaker in the country one of our former serf girls who had been trained in moscow a pretty wench
she stood turning round before me
i looked at the dress and then i looked carefully very carefully at her face
i wonder you trouble to come to me about such trifles marfa petrovna
good gracious you won t let one disturb you about anything
to tease her i said i want to get married marfa petrovna
that s just like you arkady ivanovitch it does you very little credit to come looking for a bride when you ve hardly buried your wife
and if you could make a good choice at least but i know it won t be for your happiness or hers you will only be a to all good people
then she went out and her train seemed to rustle
but perhaps you are telling lies
i rarely lie answered svidriga√Ølov thoughtfully apparently not noticing the rudeness of the question
and in the past have you ever seen ghosts before
i have seen them but only once in my life six years ago
i had a serf filka just after his burial i called out forgetting filka my pipe
he came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were
i sat still and thought he is doing it out of revenge because we had a violent quarrel just before his death
how dare you come in with a hole in your elbow
he turned and went out and never came again
i didn t tell marfa petrovna at the time
i wanted to have a service sung for him but i was ashamed
i know i am not well without your telling me though i don t know what s wrong i believe i am five times as strong as you are
i didn t ask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen but whether you believe that they exist
raskolnikov cried with positive anger
what do people generally say muttered svidriga√Ølov as though speaking to himself looking aside and bowing his head
they say you are ill so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy
but that s not strictly logical
i agree that ghosts only appear to the sick but that only proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick not that they don t exist
nothing of the sort raskolnikov insisted irritably
svidriga√Ølov went on looking at him deliberately
but what do you say to this argument help me with it ghosts are as it were shreds and fragments of other worlds the beginning of them
a man in health has of course no reason to see them because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the sake of completeness and order to live only in this life
but as soon as one is ill as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is broken one begins to realise the possibility of another world and the more seriously ill one is the closer becomes one s contact with that other world so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that world
if you believe in a future life you could believe in that too
i don t believe in a future life said raskolnikov
svidriga√Ølov sat lost in thought
and what if there are only spiders there or something of that sort he said suddenly
he is a madman thought raskolnikov
we always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception something vast vast
instead of all that what if it s one little room like a bath house in the country black and grimy and spiders in every corner and that s all eternity is
can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than that
raskolnikov cried with a feeling of anguish
and how can we tell perhaps that is just and do you know it s what i would certainly have made it answered svidriga√Ølov with a vague smile
this horrible answer sent a cold chill through raskolnikov
svidriga√Ølov raised his head looked at him and suddenly began laughing
only think he cried half an hour ago we had never seen each other we regarded each other as enemies there is a matter unsettled between us we ve thrown it aside and away we ve gone into the abstract
wasn t i right in saying that we were birds of a feather kindly allow me raskolnikov went on irritably to ask you to explain why you have honoured me with your visit and and i am in a hurry i have no time to waste
your sister avdotya romanovna is going to be married to luzhin pyotr petrovitch
can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning her name
i can t understand how you dare utter her name in my presence if you really are svidriga√Ølov
why but i ve come here to speak about her how can i avoid mentioning her
i am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this luzhin who is a connection of mine through my wife if you have only seen him for half an hour or heard any facts about him
he is no match for avdotya romanovna
i believe avdotya romanovna is sacrificing herself generously and imprudently for the sake of for the sake of her family
i fancied from all i had heard of you that you would be very glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly advantages
now i know you personally i am convinced of it
all this is very na√Øve excuse me i should have said impudent on your part said raskolnikov
you mean to say that i am seeking my own ends
don t be uneasy rodion romanovitch if i were working for my own advantage i would not have spoken out so directly
i will confess something psychologically curious about that just now defending my love for avdotya romanovna i said i was myself the victim
well let me tell you that i ve no feeling of love now not the slightest so that i wonder myself indeed for i really did feel something
through idleness and depravity raskolnikov put in
i certainly am idle and depraved but your sister has such qualities that even i could not help being impressed by them
but that s all nonsense as i see myself now
i began to be aware of it before but was only perfectly sure of it the day before yesterday almost at the moment i arrived in petersburg
i still fancied in moscow though that i was coming to try to get avdotya romanovna s hand and to cut out luzhin
excuse me for interrupting you kindly be brief and come to the object of your visit
i am in a hurry i want to go out
on arriving here and determining on a certain journey i should like to make some necessary preliminary arrangements
i left my children with an aunt they are well provided for and they have no need of me personally
and a nice father i should make too
i have taken nothing but what marfa petrovna gave me a year ago
excuse me i am just coming to the point
before the journey which may come off i want to settle luzhin too
it s not that i detest him so much but it was through him i quarrelled with marfa petrovna when i learned that she had dished up this marriage
i want now to see avdotya romanovna through your mediation and if you like in your presence to explain to her that in the first place she will never gain anything but harm from luzhin
then begging her pardon for all past unpleasantness to make her a present of ten thousand roubles and so assist the rupture with luzhin a rupture to which i believe she is herself not disinclined if she could see the way to it
you are certainly mad cried raskolnikov not so much angered as astonished
i knew you would scream at me but in the first place though i am not rich this ten thousand roubles is perfectly free i have absolutely no need for it
if avdotya romanovna does not accept it i shall waste it in some more foolish way
secondly my conscience is perfectly easy i make the offer with no ulterior motive
you may not believe it but in the end avdotya romanovna and you will know
the point is that i did actually cause your sister whom i greatly respect some trouble and unpleasantness and so sincerely regretting it i want not to compensate not to repay her for the unpleasantness but simply to do something to her advantage to show that i am not after all privileged to do nothing but harm
if there were a millionth fraction of in my offer i should not have made it so openly and i should not have offered her ten thousand only when five weeks ago i offered her more besides i may perhaps very soon marry a young lady and that alone ought to prevent suspicion of any design on avdotya romanovna
in conclusion let me say that in marrying luzhin she is taking money just the same only from another man
don t be angry rodion romanovitch think it over coolly and quietly
svidriga√Ølov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he was saying this
i beg you to say no more said raskolnikov
in any case this is unpardonable impertinence
then a man may do nothing but harm to his neighbour in this world and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good by trivial conventional formalities
if i died for instance and left that sum to your sister in my will surely she wouldn t refuse it
however if you refuse it so be it though ten thousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion
in any case i beg you to repeat what i have said to avdotya romanovna
in that case rodion romanovitch i shall be obliged to try and see her myself and worry her by doing so
and if i do tell her will you not try to see her
i don t know really what to say
i should like very much to see her once more
perhaps we may become better friends
you think we may become friends
i didn t quite intend to disturb you and i came here without reckoning on it though i was very much struck by your face this morning
where did you see me this morning
i kept fancying there is something about you like me
i am not intrusive i used to get on all right with and i never bored prince svirbey a great personage who is a distant relation of mine and i could write about raphael s in madam prilukov s album and i never left marfa petrovna s side for seven years and i used to stay the night at viazemsky s house in the hay market in the old days and i may go up in a balloon with berg perhaps
are you starting soon on your travels may i ask
why on that journey you spoke of it yourself
well that s a wide subject if only you knew what you are asking he added and gave a sudden loud short laugh
perhaps i ll get married instead of the journey
but i am very anxious to see avdotya romanovna once
tell your sister rodion romanovitch that marfa petrovna remembered her in her will and left her three thousand roubles
marfa petrovna arranged it a week before her death and it was done in my presence
avdotya romanovna will be able to receive the money in two or three weeks
as he went out svidriga√Ølov ran up against razumihin in the doorway
the two young men hurried to bakaleyev s to arrive before luzhin
asked razumihin as soon as they were in the street
it was svidriga√Ølov that landowner in whose house my sister was insulted when she was their governess
through his persecuting her with his attentions she was turned out by his wife marfa petrovna
this marfa petrovna begged dounia s forgiveness afterwards and she s just died suddenly
it was of her we were talking this morning
i don t know why i m afraid of that man
he came here at once after his wife s funeral
he is very strange and is determined on doing something
that s what i wanted to tell you do you hear
what can he do to harm avdotya romanovna
thank you rodya for speaking to me like that
did you see him asked raskolnikov after a pause
yes i noticed him i noticed him well
yes i remember him perfectly i should know him in a thousand i have a good memory for faces
that s all right muttered raskolnikov
i keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination
well you all say raskolnikov went on twisting his mouth into a smile that i am mad
i thought just now that perhaps i really am mad and have only seen a phantom
perhaps i am really mad and perhaps everything that happened all these days may be only imagination
ach rodya you have been upset again
but what did he say what did he come for
now let me tell you my story he began i came to you you were asleep
then we had dinner and then i went to porfiry s zametov was still with him
i tried to begin but it was no use
i couldn t speak in the right way
they don t seem to understand and can t understand but are not a bit ashamed
i drew porfiry to the window and began talking to him but it was still no use
he looked away and i looked away
at last i shook my fist in his ugly face and told him as a cousin i d brain him
he merely looked at me i cursed and came away
but you see i thought i d made a mess of it but as i went downstairs a brilliant idea struck me why should we trouble
of course if you were in any danger or anything but why need you care
you needn t care a hang for them
we shall have a laugh at them afterwards and if i were in your place i d mystify them more than ever
how ashamed they ll be afterwards
we can thrash them afterwards but let s laugh at them now
to be sure answered raskolnikov
strange to say till that moment it had never occurred to him to wonder what razumihin would think when he knew
as he thought it raskolnikov looked at him
razumihin s account of his visit to porfiry had very little interest for him so much had come and gone since then
in the corridor they came upon luzhin he had arrived punctually at eight and was looking for the number so that all three went in together without greeting or looking at one another
the young men walked in first while pyotr petrovitch for good manners lingered a little in the passage taking off his coat
pulcheria alexandrovna came forward at once to greet him in the doorway dounia was welcoming her brother
pyotr petrovitch walked in and quite amiably though with redoubled dignity bowed to the ladies
he looked however as though he were a little put out and could not yet recover himself
pulcheria alexandrovna who seemed also a little embarrassed hastened to make them all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling
dounia and luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table
razumihin and raskolnikov were facing pulcheria alexandrovna razumihin was next to luzhin and raskolnikov was beside his sister
pyotr petrovitch deliberately drew out a cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of a benevolent man who felt himself slighted and was firmly resolved to insist on an explanation
in the passage the idea had occurred to him to keep on his overcoat and walk away and so give the two ladies a sharp and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position
but he could not bring himself to do this
besides he could not endure uncertainty and he wanted an explanation if his request had been so openly disobeyed there was something behind it and in that case it was better to find it out beforehand it rested with him to punish them and there would always be time for that
i trust you had a favourable journey he inquired officially of pulcheria alexandrovna
and avdotya romanovna is not either
i am young and strong i don t get tired but it was a great strain for mother answered dounia
our national railways are of terrible length
mother russia as they say is a vast country
in spite of all my desire to do so i was unable to meet you yesterday
but i trust all passed off without inconvenience
oh no pyotr petrovitch it was all terribly disheartening pulcheria alexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation and if dmitri prokofitch had not been sent us i really believe by god himself we should have been utterly lost
she added introducing him to luzhin
i had the pleasure yesterday muttered pyotr petrovitch with a hostile glance sidelong at razumihin then he scowled and was silent
pyotr petrovitch belonged to that class of persons on the surface very polite in society who make a great point of punctiliousness but who directly they are crossed in anything are completely disconcerted and become more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society
again all was silent raskolnikov was obstinately mute avdotya romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon
razumihin had nothing to say so pulcheria alexandrovna was anxious again
marfa petrovna is dead have you heard
she began having recourse to her leading item of conversation
i was immediately informed and i have come to make you acquainted with the fact that arkady ivanovitch svidriga√Ølov set off in haste for petersburg immediately after his wife s funeral
so at least i have excellent authority for believing
dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother
yes indeed and doubtless not without some design having in view the rapidity of his departure and all the circumstances preceding it
won t he leave dounia in peace even here cried pulcheria alexandrovna
i imagine that neither you nor avdotya romanovna have any grounds for uneasiness unless of course you are yourselves desirous of getting into communication with him
for my part i am on my guard and am now discovering where he is lodging
oh pyotr petrovitch you would not believe what a fright you have given me pulcheria alexandrovna went on i ve only seen him twice but i thought him terrible terrible
i am convinced that he was the cause of marfa petrovna s death
it s impossible to be certain about that
i do not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of events by the moral influence so to say of the affront but as to the general conduct and moral characteristics of that personage i am in agreement with you
i do not know whether he is well off now and precisely what marfa petrovna left him this will be known to me within a very short period but no doubt here in petersburg if he has any pecuniary resources he will relapse at once into his old ways
he is the most depraved and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men
i have considerable reason to believe that marfa petrovna who was so unfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years ago was of service to him also in another way
solely by her exertions and sacrifices a criminal charge involving an element of fantastic and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to siberia was hushed up
that s the sort of man he is if you care to know
are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of this
dounia asked sternly and emphatically
i only repeat what i was told in secret by marfa petrovna
i must observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear
there was and i believe still is living here a woman called resslich a foreigner who lent small sums of money at interest and did other commissions and with this woman svidriga√Ølov had for a long while close and mysterious relations
she had a relation a niece i believe living with her a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen or perhaps not more than fourteen
resslich hated this girl and grudged her every crust she used to beat her mercilessly
one day the girl was found hanging in the garret
at the inquest the verdict was suicide
after the usual proceedings the matter ended but later on information was given that the child had been cruelly outraged by svidriga√Ølov
it is true this was not clearly established the information was given by another german woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted no statement was actually made to the police thanks to marfa petrovna s money and exertions it did not get beyond gossip
and yet the story is a very significant one
you heard no doubt avdotya romanovna when you were with them the story of the servant philip who died of ill treatment he received six years ago before the abolition of serfdom
i heard on the contrary that this philip hanged himself
quite so but what drove him or rather perhaps disposed him to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of svidriga√Ølov
i don t know that answered dounia dryly
i only heard a queer story that philip was a sort of hypochondriac a sort of domestic philosopher the servants used to say he read himself silly and that he hanged himself partly on account of svidriga√Ølov s mockery of him and not his blows
when i was there he behaved well to the servants and they were actually fond of him though they certainly did blame him for philip s death
i perceive avdotya romanovna that you seem disposed to undertake his defence all of a sudden luzhin observed twisting his lips into an ambiguous smile there s no doubt that he is an astute man and insinuating where ladies are concerned of which marfa petrovna who has died so strangely is a terrible instance
my only desire has been to be of service to you and your mother with my advice in view of the renewed efforts which may certainly be anticipated from him
for my part it s my firm conviction that he will end in a debtor s prison again
marfa petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything substantial on him having regard for his children s interests and if she left him anything it would only be the merest sufficiency something insignificant and ephemeral which would not last a year for a man of his habits
pyotr petrovitch i beg you said dounia say no more of svidriga√Ølov
he has just been to see me said raskolnikov breaking his silence for the first time
there were exclamations from all and they all turned to him
even pyotr petrovitch was roused
an hour and a half ago he came in when i was asleep waked me and introduced himself raskolnikov continued
he was fairly cheerful and at ease and quite hopes that we shall become friends
he is particularly anxious by the way dounia for an interview with you at which he asked me to assist
he has a proposition to make to you and he told me about it
he told me too that a week before her death marfa petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will dounia and that you can receive the money very shortly
cried pulcheria alexandrovna crossing herself
then he said that he wasn t rich and all the estate was left to his children who are now with an aunt then that he was staying somewhere not far from me but where i don t know i didn t ask
but what what does he want to propose to dounia cried pulcheria alexandrovna in a fright
raskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea
pyotr petrovitch looked at his watch
i am compelled to keep a business engagement and so i shall not be in your way he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up
don t go pyotr petrovitch said dounia you intended to spend the evening
besides you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an explanation with mother
precisely so avdotya romanovna pyotr petrovitch answered impressively sitting down again but still holding his hat
i certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon a very important point indeed
but as your brother can not speak openly in my presence of some proposals of svidriga√Ølov i too do not desire and am not able to speak openly in the presence of others of certain matters of the greatest gravity
moreover my most weighty and urgent request has been disregarded
assuming an aggrieved air luzhin relapsed into dignified silence
your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was disregarded solely at my insistance said dounia
you wrote that you had been insulted by my brother i think that this must be explained at once and you must be reconciled
and if rodya really has insulted you then he and apologise
pyotr petrovitch took a stronger line
there are insults avdotya romanovna which no goodwill can make us forget
there is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep and when it has been overstepped there is no return
that wasn t what i was speaking of exactly pyotr petrovitch dounia interrupted with some impatience
please understand that our whole future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as soon as possible
i tell you frankly at the start that i can not look at it in any other light and if you have the least regard for me all this business must be ended however hard that may be
i repeat that if my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness
i am surprised at your putting the question like that said luzhin getting more and more irritated
esteeming and so to say adoring you i may at the same time very well indeed be able to dislike some member of your family
though i lay claim to the happiness of your hand i can not accept duties incompatible with
ah don t be so ready to take offence pyotr petrovitch dounia interrupted with feeling and be the sensible and generous man i have always considered and wish to consider you to be
i ve given you a great promise i am your betrothed
trust me in this matter and believe me i shall be capable of judging impartially
my assuming the part of judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you
when i insisted on his coming to our interview after your letter i told him nothing of what i meant to do
understand that if you are not reconciled i must choose between you it must be either you or he
that is how the question rests on your side and on his
i don t want to be mistaken in my choice and i must not be
for your sake i must break off with my brother for my brother s sake i must break off with you
i can find out for certain now whether he is a brother to me and i want to know it and of you whether i am dear to you whether you esteem me whether you are the husband for me
avdotya romanovna luzhin declared huffily your words are of too much consequence to me i will say more they are offensive in view of the position i have the honour to occupy in relation to you
to say nothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an impertinent boy you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to me
you say you or he showing thereby of how little consequence i am in your eyes
i can not let this pass considering the relationship and the obligations existing between us
i set your interest beside all that has hitherto been most precious in my life what has made up the of my life and here you are offended at my making too
raskolnikov smiled sarcastically razumihin fidgeted but pyotr petrovitch did not accept the reproof on the contrary at every word he became more persistent and irritable as though he relished it
love for the future partner of your life for your husband ought to outweigh your love for your brother he pronounced sententiously and in any case i can not be put on the same level
although i said so emphatically that i would not speak openly in your brother s presence nevertheless i intend now to ask your honoured mother for a necessary explanation on a point of great importance closely affecting my dignity
your son he turned to pulcheria alexandrovna yesterday in the presence of razsudkin or
excuse me i have forgotten your surname he bowed politely to razumihin insulted me by misrepresenting the idea i expressed to you in a private conversation drinking coffee that is that marriage with a poor girl who has had experience of trouble is more advantageous from the conjugal point of view than with one who has lived in luxury since it is more profitable for the moral character
your son intentionally exaggerated the significance of my words and made them ridiculous accusing me of malicious intentions and as far as i could see relied upon your correspondence with him
i shall consider myself happy pulcheria alexandrovna if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite conclusion and thereby considerately reassure me
kindly let me know in what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to rodion romanovitch
i don t remember faltered pulcheria alexandrovna
i repeated them as i understood them
i don t know how rodya repeated them to you perhaps he exaggerated
he could not have exaggerated them except at your instigation
pyotr petrovitch pulcheria alexandrovna declared with dignity the proof that dounia and i did not take your words in a very bad sense is the fact that we are here
good mother said dounia approvingly
then this is my fault again said luzhin aggrieved
well pyotr petrovitch you keep blaming rodion but you yourself have just written what was false about him pulcheria alexandrovna added gaining courage
i don t remember writing anything false
you wrote raskolnikov said sharply not turning to luzhin that i gave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who was killed as was the fact but to his daughter whom i had never seen till yesterday
you wrote this to make dissension between me and my family and for that object added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl whom you don t know
excuse me sir said luzhin quivering with fury
i enlarged upon your qualities and conduct in my letter solely in response to your sister s and mother s inquiries how i found you and what impression you made on me
as for what you ve alluded to in my letter be so good as to point out one word of falsehood show that is that you didn t throw away your money and that there are not worthless persons in that family however unfortunate
to my thinking you with all your virtues are not worth the little finger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones
would you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother and sister
i have done so already if you care to know
i made her sit down with mother and dounia
rodya cried pulcheria alexandrovna
dounia crimsoned razumihin knitted his brows
luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm
you may see for yourself avdotya romanovna he said whether it is possible for us to agree
i hope now that this question is at an end once and for all
i will withdraw that i may not hinder the pleasures of family intimacy and the discussion of secrets
he got up from his chair and took his hat
but in withdrawing i venture to request that for the future i may be spared similar meetings and so to say compromises
i appeal particularly to you honoured pulcheria alexandrovna on this subject the more as my letter was addressed to you and to no one else
pulcheria alexandrovna was a little offended
you seem to think we are completely under your authority pyotr petrovitch
dounia has told you the reason your desire was disregarded she had the best intentions
and indeed you write as though you were laying commands upon me
are we to consider every desire of yours as a command
let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show particular delicacy and consideration for us now because we have thrown up everything and have come here relying on you and so we are in any case in a sense in your hands
that is not quite true pulcheria alexandrovna especially at the present moment when the news has come of marfa petrovna s legacy which seems indeed very apropos judging from the new tone you take to me he added sarcastically
judging from that remark we may certainly presume that you were reckoning on our helplessness dounia observed irritably
but now in any case i can not reckon on it and i particularly desire not to hinder your discussion of the secret proposals of arkady ivanovitch svidriga√Ølov which he has entrusted to your brother and which have i perceive a great and possibly a very agreeable interest for you
razumihin could not sit still on his chair
pyotr petrovitch go away she turned to him white with anger
pyotr petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion
he had too much confidence in himself in his power and in the helplessness of his victims
he could not believe it even now
he turned pale and his lips quivered
avdotya romanovna if i go out of this door now after such a dismissal then you may reckon on it i will never come back
what insolence cried dounia springing up from her seat
i don t want you to come back again
cried luzhin utterly unable to the last moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of his reckoning now
but do you know avdotya romanovna that i might protest
what right have you to speak to her like that
pulcheria alexandrovna intervened hotly
am i to give my dounia to a man like you
we are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action and i above all
but you have bound me pulcheria alexandrovna luzhin stormed in a frenzy by your promise and now you deny it and
i have been led on account of that into expenses
this last complaint was so characteristic of pyotr petrovitch that raskolnikov pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it could not help breaking into laughter
but pulcheria alexandrovna was furious
but the conductor brought it for nothing for you
what are you thinking about pyotr petrovitch it was you bound us hand and foot not we
enough mother no more please avdotya romanovna implored
pyotr petrovitch do be kind and go
i am going but one last word he said quite unable to control himself
your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that i made up my mind to take you so to speak after the gossip of the town had spread all over the district in regard to your reputation
disregarding public opinion for your sake and reinstating your reputation i certainly might very well reckon on a fitting return and might indeed look for gratitude on your part
and my eyes have only now been opened
i see myself that i may have acted very very recklessly in disregarding the universal verdict
does the fellow want his head smashed cried razumihin jumping up
you are a mean and spiteful man cried dounia
not a movement cried raskolnikov holding razumihin back then going close up to luzhin kindly leave the room
he said quietly and distinctly and not a word more or
pyotr petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that worked with anger then he turned went out and rarely has any man carried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against raskolnikov
him and him alone he blamed for everything
it is noteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case was perhaps not utterly lost and that so far as the ladies were concerned all might very well indeed be set right again
the fact was that up to the last moment he had never expected such an ending he had been overbearing to the last degree never dreaming that two destitute and defenceless women could escape from his control
this conviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit a conceit to the point of fatuity
pyotr petrovitch who had made his way up from insignificance was morbidly given to had the highest opinion of his intelligence and capacities and sometimes even gloated in solitude over his image in the glass
but what he loved and valued above all was the money he had amassed by his labour and by all sorts of devices that money made him the equal of all who had been his superiors
when he had bitterly reminded dounia that he had decided to take her in spite of evil report pyotr petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity and had indeed felt genuinely indignant at such black ingratitude
and yet when he made dounia his offer he was fully aware of the groundlessness of all the gossip
the story had been everywhere contradicted by marfa petrovna and was by then disbelieved by all the townspeople who were warm in dounia a defence
and he would not have denied that he knew all that at the time
yet he still thought highly of his own resolution in lifting dounia to his level and regarded it as something heroic
in speaking of it to dounia he had let out the secret feeling he cherished and admired and he could not understand that others should fail to admire it too
he had called on raskolnikov with the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good deeds and to hear agreeable flattery
and as he went downstairs now he considered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised
dounia was simply essential to him to do without her was unthinkable
for many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage but he had gone on waiting and amassing money
he brooded with relish in profound secret over the image of a girl virtuous poor she must be poor very young very pretty of good birth and education very timid one who had suffered much and was completely humbled before him one who would all her life look on him as her saviour worship him admire him and only him
how many scenes how many amorous episodes he had imagined on this seductive and playful theme when his work was over
and behold the dream of so many years was all but realised the beauty and education of avdotya romanovna had impressed him her helpless position had been a great allurement in her he had found even more than he dreamed of
here was a girl of pride character virtue of education and breeding superior to his own he felt that and this creature would be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension and would humble herself in the dust before him and he would have absolute unbounded power over her
not long before he had too after long reflection and hesitation made an important change in his career and was now entering on a wider circle of business
with this change his cherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely to be realised
he was in fact determined to try his fortune in petersburg
he knew that women could do a very great deal
the fascination of a charming virtuous highly educated woman might make his way easier might do wonders in attracting people to him throwing an aureole round him and now everything was in ruins
this sudden horrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder it was like a hideous joke an absurdity
he had only been a tiny bit masterful had not even time to speak out had simply made a joke been carried away and it had ended so seriously
and of course too he did love dounia in his own way he already possessed her in his dreams and all at once
the next day the very next day it must all be set right smoothed over settled
above all he must crush that conceited milksop who was the cause of it all
with a sick feeling he could not help recalling razumihin too but he soon reassured himself on that score as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him
the man he really dreaded in earnest was svidriga√Ølov
he had in short a great deal to attend to
no i i am more to blame than anyone said dounia kissing and embracing her mother
i was tempted by his money but on my honour brother i had no idea he was such a base man
if i had seen through him before nothing would have tempted me
pulcheria alexandrovna muttered but half consciously as though scarcely able to realise what had happened
they were all relieved and in five minutes they were laughing
only now and then dounia turned white and frowned remembering what had passed
pulcheria alexandrovna was surprised to find that she too was glad she had only that morning thought rupture with luzhin a terrible misfortune
he did not yet dare to express his joy fully but he was in a fever of excitement as though a had fallen off his heart
now he had the right to devote his life to them to serve them
but he felt afraid to think of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination range
but raskolnikov sat still in the same place almost sullen and indifferent
though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of luzhin he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened
dounia could not help thinking that he was still angry with her and pulcheria alexandrovna watched him timidly
what did svidriga√Ølov say to you said dounia approaching him
yes yes cried pulcheria alexandrovna
he wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he desires to see you once in my presence
on no account cried pulcheria alexandrovna
and how dare he offer her money
then raskolnikov repeated rather dryly his conversation with svidriga√Ølov omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of marfa petrovna wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk
what answer did you give him asked dounia
at first i said i would not take any message to you
then he said that he would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help
he assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation now he has no feeling for you
he doesn t want you to marry luzhin
his talk was altogether rather muddled
how do you explain him to yourself rodya
i must confess i don t quite understand him
he offers you ten thousand and yet says he is not well off
he says he is going away and in ten minutes he forgets he has said it
then he says he is going to be married and has already fixed on the girl
no doubt he has a motive and probably a bad one
but it s odd that he should be so clumsy about it if he had any designs against you
of course i refused this money on your account once for all
altogether i thought him very strange
one might almost think he was mad
but i may be mistaken that may only be the part he assumes
the death of marfa petrovna seems to have made a great impression on him
god rest her soul exclaimed pulcheria alexandrovna
i shall always always pray for her
where should we be now dounia without this three thousand
it s as though it had fallen from heaven
why rodya this morning we had only three roubles in our pocket and dounia and i were just planning to pawn her watch so as to avoid borrowing from that man until he offered help
dounia seemed strangely impressed by svidriga√Ølov s offer
he has got some terrible plan she said in a half whisper to herself almost shuddering
raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror
i fancy i shall have to see him more than once again he said to dounia
will you give me leave too avdotya romanovna
dounia smiled and held out her hand but the look of anxiety did not leave her face
pulcheria alexandrovna gazed at her timidly but the three thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her
a quarter of an hour later they were all engaged in a lively conversation
even raskolnikov listened attentively for some time though he did not talk
and what are you to do in a little town
the great thing is you are all here together and you need one another you do need one another believe me
for a time anyway take me into partnership and i assure you we ll plan a capital enterprise
i ll explain it all in detail to you the whole project
it all flashed into my head this morning before anything had happened
i tell you what i have an uncle i must introduce him to you a most accommodating and respectable old man
this uncle has got a capital of a thousand roubles and he lives on his pension and has no need of that money
for the last two years he has been bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent
i know what that means he simply wants to help me
last year i had no need of it but this year i resolved to borrow it as soon as he arrived
then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have enough for a start so we ll go into partnership and what are we going to do
then razumihin began to unfold his project and he explained at length that almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all of what they are selling and for that reason they are usually bad publishers and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give a profit sometimes a considerable one
razumihin had indeed been dreaming of setting up as a publisher
for the last two years he had been working in publishers offices and knew three european languages well though he had told raskolnikov six days before that he was schwach in german with an object of persuading him to take half his translation and half the payment for it
he had told a lie then and raskolnikov knew he was lying
why why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief means of success money of our own
of course there will be a lot of work but we will work you avdotya romanovna i rodion
you get a splendid profit on some books nowadays
and the great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants translating and we shall be translating publishing learning all at once
i can be of use because i have experience
for nearly two years i ve been scuttling about among the publishers and now i know every detail of their business
you need not be a saint to make pots believe me
and why why should we let our chance slip
why i know and i kept the secret two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles simply for thinking of translating and publishing
indeed and i would not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them
if i were to tell a publisher i dare say he d hesitate they are such blockheads
and as for the business side printing paper selling you trust to me i know my way about
we ll begin in a small way and go on to a large
in any case it will get us our living and we shall get back our capital
i like what you are saying dmitri prokofitch
i know nothing about it of course put in pulcheria alexandrovna it may be a good idea but again god knows
of course we must remain here at least for a time
what do you think brother said dounia
i think he s got a very good idea he answered
of course it s too soon to dream of a publishing firm but we certainly might bring out five or six books and be sure of success
i know of one book myself which would be sure to go well
and as for his being able to manage it there s no doubt about that either
now stay there s a flat here in this house belonging to the same owner
it s a special flat apart not communicating with these lodgings
it s furnished rent moderate three rooms
suppose you take them to begin with
i ll pawn your watch and bring you the money and everything can be arranged then
you can all three live together and rodya will be with you
but where are you off to rodya what rodya you are going already
pulcheria alexandrovna asked in dismay
at such a minute cried razumihin
dounia looked at her brother with incredulous wonder
he held his cap in his hand he was preparing to leave them
one would think you were burying me or saying for ever he said somewhat oddly
he attempted to smile but it did not turn out a smile
but who knows perhaps it is the last time we shall see each other
it was what he was thinking and it somehow was uttered aloud
what is the matter with you cried his mother
where are you going rodya asked dounia rather strangely
he answered vaguely as though hesitating what he would say
but there was a look of sharp determination in his white face
i meant to say as i was coming here
i meant to tell you mother and you dounia that it would be better for us to part for a time
i will come afterwards i will come of myself when it s possible
whatever may come to me whether i come to ruin or not i want to be alone
forget me altogether it s better
when i can i ll come of myself or
perhaps it will all come back but now if you love me give me up else i shall begin to hate you i feel it
good god cried pulcheria alexandrovna
both his mother and his sister were terribly alarmed
rodya rodya be reconciled with us
he turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room
brother what are you doing to mother
she whispered her eyes flashing with indignation
i m coming he muttered in an undertone as though not fully conscious of what he was saying and he went out of the room
wicked heartless egoist cried dounia
razumihin whispered in her ear squeezing her hand tightly
i shall be back directly he shouted to the mother and he ran out of the room
raskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the passage
i knew you would run after me he said
go back to them be with them be with them and always
i perhaps i shall come if i can
and without holding out his hand he walked away
razumihin muttered at his wits end
once for all never ask me about anything
it was dark in the corridor they were standing near the lamp
for a minute they were looking at one another in silence
razumihin remembered that minute all his life
raskolnikov s burning and intent eyes grew more penetrating every moment piercing into his soul into his consciousness
something strange as it were passed between them
some idea some hint as it were slipped something awful hideous and suddenly understood on both sides
do you understand now said raskolnikov his face twitching nervously
go back go to them he said suddenly and turning quickly he went out of the house
i will not attempt to describe how razumihin went back to the ladies how he soothed them how he protested that rodya needed rest in his illness protested that rodya was sure to come that he would come every day that he was very very much upset that he must not be irritated that he razumihin would watch over him would get him a doctor the best doctor a consultation
in fact from that evening razumihin took his place with them as a son and a brother
chapter iv raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where sonia lived
it was an old green house of three storeys
he found the porter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of kapernaumov the tailor
having found in the corner of the courtyard the entrance to the dark and narrow staircase he mounted to the second floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey over the yard
while he was wandering in the darkness uncertain where to turn for kapernaumov s door a door opened three paces from him he mechanically took hold of it
it s i come to see you answered raskolnikov and he walked into the tiny entry
on a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick
good heavens cried sonia weakly and she stood rooted to the spot
this way and raskolnikov trying not to look at her hastened in
a minute later sonia too came in with the candle set down the candlestick and completely disconcerted stood before him inexpressibly agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit
the colour rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes
she felt sick and ashamed and happy too
raskolnikov turned away quickly and sat on a chair by the table
he scanned the room in a rapid glance
it was a large but exceedingly room the only one let by the kapernaumovs to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left
in the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door always kept locked
that led to the next flat which formed a separate lodging
sonia s room looked like a barn it was a very irregular quadrangle and this gave it a grotesque appearance
a wall with three windows looking out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute angle and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light
the other corner was disproportionately obtuse
there was scarcely any furniture in the big room in the corner on the right was a bedstead beside it nearest the door a chair
a plain deal table covered by a blue cloth stood against the same wall close to the door into the other flat
on the opposite wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers looking as it were lost in a desert
that was all there was in the room
the yellow scratched and shabby was black in the corners
it must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter
there was every sign of poverty even the bedstead had no curtain
sonia looked in silence at her visitor who was so attentively and unceremoniously scrutinising her room and even began at last to tremble with terror as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter of her destinies
he asked still not lifting his eyes
yes muttered sonia oh yes it is she added hastily as though in that lay her means of escape
my landlady s clock has just struck
i ve come to you for the last time raskolnikov went on gloomily although this was the first time
i may perhaps not see you again are you going away
then you are not coming to katerina ivanovna
never mind that i ve come to say one word
he raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was sitting down while she was all the while standing before him
sit down he said in a changed voice gentle and friendly
he looked kindly and almost compassionately at her
quite transparent like a dead hand
i have always been like that she said
even when you lived at home yes
of course you were he added abruptly and the expression of his face and the sound of his voice changed again suddenly
you rent this room from the kapernaumovs
yes they live there through that door
they have another room like this
i should be afraid in your room at night he observed gloomily
they are very good people very kind answered sonia who still seemed bewildered and all the furniture everything everything is theirs
and they are very kind and the children too often come to see me
it s not exactly that she stammers but she can t speak plainly
and it s only the eldest one that stammers and the others are simply ill
but where did you hear about them
and how you went out at six o clock and came back at nine and how katerina ivanovna knelt down by your bed
i fancied i saw him she whispered hesitatingly
i was walking in the street out there at the corner about ten o clock and he seemed to be walking in front
i wanted to go to katerina ivanovna
you were walking in the streets
yes sonia whispered abruptly again overcome with confusion and looking down
katerina ivanovna used to beat you i dare say
sonia looked at him almost with dismay
of course said sonia with plaintive emphasis and she clasped her hands in distress
you see she is quite like a child
her mind is quite unhinged you see from sorrow
and how clever she used to be how generous how kind
ah you don t understand you don t understand
sonia said this as though in despair wringing her hands in excitement and distress
her pale cheeks flushed there was a look of anguish in her eyes
it was clear that she was stirred to the very depths that she was longing to speak to champion to express something
a sort of compassion if one may so express it was reflected in every feature of her face
and if she did beat me what then
you know nothing nothing about it
she is seeking righteousness she is pure
she has such faith that there must be righteousness everywhere and she expects it
and if you were to torture her she wouldn t do wrong
she doesn t see that it s impossible for people to be righteous and she is angry at it
sonia looked at him inquiringly
they are left on your hands you see
they were all on your hands before though
and your father came to you to beg for drink
i don t know sonia articulated mournfully
they are in debt for the lodging but the landlady i hear said that she wanted to get rid of them and katerina ivanovna says that she won t stay another minute
sonia was agitated again and even angry as though a canary or some other little bird were to be angry
she persisted getting hot and excited
her mind is unhinged haven t you noticed it
at one minute she is worrying like a child that everything should be right the lunch and all that
then she is wringing her hands spitting blood weeping and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the wall in despair
then she will be comforted again
she builds all her hopes on you she says that you will help her now and that she will borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to superintend it and we will begin a new splendid life
and she kisses and hugs me comforts me and you know she has such faith such faith in her fancies
and all the day long she has been washing cleaning mending
she dragged the wash tub into the room with her feeble hands and sank on the bed gasping for breath
we went this morning to the shops to buy shoes for polenka and lida for theirs are quite worn out
only the money we d reckoned wasn t enough not nearly enough
and she picked out such dear little boots for she has taste you don t know
and there in the shop she burst out crying before the shopmen because she hadn t enough
well after that i can understand your living like this raskolnikov said with a bitter smile
why i know you gave your last penny yourself though you d seen nothing of it and if you d seen everything oh dear
and how often how often i ve brought her to tears
ah i ve been wretched at the thought of it all day
sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it
yes i i went to see them she went on weeping and father said read me something sonia my head aches read to me here s a book
he had a book he had got from andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov he lives there he always used to get hold of such funny books
and i said i can t stay as i didn t want to read and i d gone in chiefly to show katerina ivanovna some collars
lizaveta the pedlar sold me some collars and cuffs cheap pretty new embroidered ones
katerina ivanovna liked them very much she put them on and looked at herself in the glass and was delighted with them
make me a present of them sonia she said please do
she said she wanted them so much
they just reminded her of her old happy days
she looked at herself in the glass admired herself and she has no clothes at all no things of her own hasn t had all these years
and she never asks anyone for anything she is proud she d sooner give away everything
and these she asked for she liked them so much
what use are they to you katerina ivanovna
i spoke like that to her i ought not to have said that
and she was so grieved so grieved at my refusing her
and she was not grieved for the collars but for my refusing i saw that
ah if only i could bring it all back change it take back those words
did you know lizaveta the pedlar
katerina ivanovna is in consumption rapid consumption she will soon die said raskolnikov after a pause without answering her question
and sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands as though imploring that she should not
but it will be better if she does die
no not better not at all better
sonia unconsciously repeated in dismay
what can you do except take them to live with you
oh i don t know cried sonia almost in despair and she put her hands to her head
it was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and he had only roused it again
and what if even now while katerina ivanovna is alive you get ill and are taken to the hospital what will happen then
and sonia s face worked with awful terror
raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile
you are not insured against it are you
they will be in the street all of them she will cough and beg and knock her head against some wall as she did and the children will cry
then she will fall down be taken to the police station and to the hospital she will die and the children
god will not let it be broke at last from sonia s overburdened bosom
she listened looking imploringly at him clasping her hands in dumb entreaty as though it all depended upon him
raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room
sonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible dejection
he asked stopping suddenly before her
sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again
no she whispered with a painful effort
it will be the same with polenka no doubt he said suddenly
sonia cried aloud in desperation as though she had been stabbed
god would not allow anything so awful
but perhaps there is no god at all raskolnikov answered with a sort of malignance laughed and looked at her
sonia s face suddenly changed a tremor passed over it
she looked at him with unutterable reproach tried to say something but could not speak and broke into bitter bitter sobs hiding her face in her hands
you say katerina ivanovna s mind is unhinged your own mind is unhinged he said after a brief silence
he still paced up and down the room in silence not looking at her
at last he went up to her his eyes glittered
he put his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful face
his eyes were hard feverish and piercing his lips were twitching
all at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the ground kissed her foot
sonia drew back from him as from a madman
and certainly he looked like a madman
she muttered turning pale and a sudden anguish clutched at her heart
i did not bow down to you i bowed down to all the suffering of humanity he said wildly and walked away to the window
listen he added turning to her a minute later
i said just now to an insolent man that he was not worth your little finger and that i did my sister honour making her sit beside you
and in her presence cried sonia frightened
it was not because of your dishonour and your sin i said that of you but because of your great suffering
but you are a great sinner that s true he added almost solemnly and your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself
isn t it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so and at the same time you know yourself you ve only to open your eyes that you are not helping anyone by it not saving anyone from anything
tell me he went on almost in a frenzy how this shame and degradation can exist in you side by side with other opposite holy feelings
it would be better a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end it all
sonia asked faintly gazing at him with eyes of anguish but not seeming surprised at his suggestion
raskolnikov looked strangely at her
he read it all in her face so she must have had that thought already perhaps many times and earnestly she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly that now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion
she had not even noticed the cruelty of his words
the significance of his reproaches and his peculiar attitude to her shame she had of course not noticed either and that too was clear to him
but he saw how monstrously the thought of her disgraceful shameful position was torturing her and had long tortured her
what what he thought could hitherto have hindered her from putting an end to it
only then he realised what those poor little orphan children and that pitiful katerina ivanovna knocking her head against the wall in her consumption meant for sonia
but nevertheless it was clear to him again that with her character and the amount of education she had after all received she could not in any case remain so
he was still confronted by the question how could she have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind since she could not bring herself to jump into the water
of course he knew that sonia s position was an exceptional case though unhappily not unique and not infrequent indeed but that very exceptionalness her tinge of education her previous life might one would have thought have killed her at the first step on that revolting path
what held her up surely not depravity
all that infamy had obviously only touched her mechanically not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her heart he saw that
he saw through her as she stood before him
there are three ways before her he thought the canal the madhouse or at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns the heart to stone
the last idea was the most revolting but he was a sceptic he was young abstract and therefore cruel and so he could not help believing that the last end was the most likely
can that creature who has still preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last into that sink of filth and iniquity
can the process already have begun
can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now because vice has begun to be less loathsome to her
he cried as sonia had just before
no what has kept her from the canal till now is the idea of sin and they the children
and if she has not gone out of her mind but who says she has not gone out of her mind
can one talk can one reason as she does
how can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she is slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger
he stayed obstinately at that thought
he liked that explanation indeed better than any other
he began looking more intently at her
so you pray to god a great deal sonia
sonia did not speak he stood beside her waiting for an answer
she whispered rapidly forcibly glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes and squeezing his hand
sonia was silent a long while as though she could not answer
her weak chest kept heaving with emotion
she cried suddenly looking sternly and wrathfully at him
that s it that s it he repeated to himself
he does everything she whispered quickly looking down again
that s the explanation he decided scrutinising her with eager curiosity with a new strange almost morbid feeling
he gazed at that pale thin irregular angular little face those soft blue eyes which could flash with such fire such stern energy that little body still shaking with indignation and anger and it all seemed to him more and more strange almost impossible
there was a book lying on the chest of drawers
he had noticed it every time he paced up and down the room
now he took it up and looked at it
it was the new testament in the russian translation
it was bound in leather old and worn
he called to her across the room
she was still standing in the same place three steps from the table
it was brought me she answered as it were unwillingly not looking at him
everything about sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every moment
he carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the pages
sonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer
she was standing sideways to the table
where is the raising of lazarus
you are not looking in the right place
it s in the fourth gospel she whispered sternly without looking at him
find it and read it to me he said
he sat down with his elbow on the table leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly prepared to listen
in three weeks time they ll welcome me in the madhouse
i shall be there if i am not in a worse place he muttered to himself
sonia heard raskolnikov s request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly to the table
she asked looking up at him across the table
her voice became sterner and sterner
and haven t you heard it in church
and you won t go to your father s funeral
his nerves were more and more strained
we used to read together and talk
the last phrase sounded strange in his ears
and here was something new again the mysterious meetings with lizaveta and both of them religious maniacs
i shall be a religious maniac myself soon
he cried irritably and insistently
she hardly dared to read to him
he looked almost with exasperation at the unhappy lunatic
she whispered softly and as it were breathlessly
sonia opened the book and found the place
her hands were shaking her voice failed her
twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the first syllable
now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany she forced herself at last to read but at the third word her voice broke like an overstrained string
there was a catch in her breath
raskolnikov saw in part why sonia could not bring herself to read to him and the more he saw this the more roughly and irritably he insisted on her doing so
he understood only too well how painful it was for her to betray and unveil all that was her
he understood that these feelings really were her which she had kept perhaps for years perhaps from childhood while she lived with an unhappy father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief in the midst of starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches
but at the same time he knew now and knew for certain that although it filled her with dread and suffering yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read to that he might hear it and to read
he read this in her eyes he could see it in her intense emotion
she mastered herself controlled the spasm in her throat and went on reading the eleventh chapter of john
she went on to the nineteenth verse
and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother
then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house
then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died
but i know that even now whatsoever
thou wilt ask of god god will give it thee
then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would quiver and break again
jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again
martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day
jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die
she saith unto him and drawing a painful breath sonia read distinctly and forcibly as though she were making a public confession of faith
yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world
she stopped and looked up quickly at him but controlling herself went on reading
raskolnikov sat without moving his elbows on the table and his eyes turned away
then when mary was come where jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died
when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have ye laid him
they said unto him lord come and see
then said the jews behold how he loved him
and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died
raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion
she was trembling in a real physical fever
she was getting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense triumph came over her
her voice rang out like a bell triumph and joy gave it power
the lines danced before her eyes but she knew what she was reading by heart
at the last verse could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind dropping her voice she passionately reproduced the doubt the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving jews who in another moment would fall at his feet as though struck by thunder sobbing and believing
and too is blinded and unbelieving he too will hear he too will believe yes yes
at once now was what she was dreaming and she was quivering with happy anticipation
jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave
it was a cave and a stone lay upon it
jesus said take ye away the stone
martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead four days
jesus saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of god
then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid
and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me
and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me
and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth
and he that was dead came forth
she read loudly cold and trembling with ecstasy as though she were seeing it before her eyes
bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin
jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go
then many of the jews which came to mary and had seen the things which jesus did believed on him
she could read no more closed the book and got up from her chair quickly
that is all about the raising of lazarus she whispered severely and abruptly and turning away she stood motionless not daring to raise her eyes to him
the was flickering out in the battered candlestick dimly lighting up in the room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely been reading together the eternal book
i came to speak of something raskolnikov said aloud frowning
she lifted her eyes to him in silence
his face was particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination in it
i have abandoned my family he said my mother and sister
i ve broken with them completely
her recent meeting with his mother and sister had left a great impression which she could not analyse
she heard his news almost with horror
i ve come to you we are both accursed let us go our way together
his eyes glittered as though he were mad sonia thought in her turn
she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back
i only know it s the same road i know that and nothing more
she looked at him and understood nothing
she knew only that he was terribly infinitely unhappy
no one of them will understand if you tell them but i have understood
i need you that is why i have come to you
i don t understand whispered sonia
you too have transgressed have had the strength to transgress
you have laid hands on yourself you have destroyed a life
you might have lived in spirit and understanding but you ll end in the hay market
but you won t be able to stand it and if you remain alone you ll go out of your mind like me
you are like a mad creature already
so we must go together on the same road
what s all this for said sonia strangely and violently agitated by his words
because you can t remain like this that s why
you must look things straight in the face at last and not weep like a child and cry that god won t allow it
what will happen if you should really be taken to the hospital
she is mad and in consumption she ll soon die and the children
do you mean to tell me polenka won t come to grief
haven t you seen children here at the street corners sent out by their mothers to beg
i ve found out where those mothers live and in what surroundings
children can t remain children there
at seven the child is vicious and a thief
yet children you know are the image of christ theirs is the kingdom of heaven
he bade us honour and love them they are the humanity of the future
what s to be done what s to be done repeated sonia weeping hysterically and wringing her hands
break what must be broken once for all that s all and take the suffering on oneself
freedom and power and above all power
over all trembling creation and all the
perhaps it s the last time i shall speak to you
if i don t come you ll hear of it all and then remember these words
and some day later on in years to come you ll understand perhaps what they meant
if i come i ll tell you who killed lizaveta
she asked chilled with horror looking wildly at him
i know and will tell you only you
i m not coming to you to ask forgiveness but simply to tell you
i chose you out long ago to hear this when your father talked of you and when lizaveta was alive i thought of it
sonia gazed at him as at a madman
but she herself was like one insane and felt it
good heavens how does he know who killed lizaveta
but at the same time did not enter her head not for a moment
he has abandoned his mother and sister
he had kissed her foot and said said yes he had said it clearly that he could not live without her
sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious
she jumped up from time to time wept and wrung her hands then sank again into feverish sleep and dreamt of polenka katerina ivanovna and lizaveta of reading the gospel and him him with pale face with burning eyes kissing her feet weeping
on the other side of the door on the right which divided sonia s room from madame resslich s flat was a room which had long stood empty
a card was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the canal advertising it to let
sonia had long been accustomed to the room s being uninhabited
but all that time svidriga√Ølov had been standing listening at the door of the empty room
when raskolnikov went out he stood still thought a moment went on tiptoe to his own room which adjoined the empty one brought a chair and noiselessly carried it to the door that led to sonia s room
the conversation had struck him as interesting and remarkable and he had greatly enjoyed it so much so that he brought a chair that he might not in the future for instance have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour but might listen in comfort
when next morning at eleven o clock punctually raskolnikov went into the department of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in to porfiry petrovitch he was surprised at being kept waiting so long it was at least ten minutes before he was summoned
he had expected that they would pounce upon him
but he stood in the and people who apparently had nothing to do with him were continually passing to and fro before him
in the next room which looked like an office several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had no notion who or what raskolnikov might be
he looked uneasily and suspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard some mysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape
but there was nothing of the sort he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty details then other people no one seemed to have any concern with him
he might go where he liked for them
the conviction grew stronger in him that if that enigmatic man of yesterday that phantom sprung out of the earth had seen everything they would not have let him stand and wait like that
and would they have waited till he elected to appear at eleven
either the man had not yet given information or or simply he knew nothing had seen nothing and how could he have seen anything
and so all that had happened to him the day before was again a phantom exaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination
this conjecture had begun to grow strong the day before in the midst of all his alarm and despair
thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh conflict he was suddenly aware that he was trembling and he felt a rush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear at facing that hateful porfiry petrovitch
what he dreaded above all was meeting that man again he hated him with an intense unmitigated hatred and was afraid his hatred might betray him
his indignation was such that he ceased trembling at once he made ready to go in with a cold and arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible to watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained nerves
at that moment he was summoned to porfiry petrovitch
he found porfiry petrovitch alone in his study
his study was a room neither large nor small furnished with a large that stood before a sofa upholstered in checked material a bureau a bookcase in the corner and several chairs all government furniture of polished yellow wood
in the further wall there was a closed door beyond it there were no doubt other rooms
on raskolnikov s entrance porfiry petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in and they remained alone
he met his visitor with an apparently genial and air and it was only after a few minutes that raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him as though he had been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret
in our domain began porfiry holding out both hands to him
come sit down old man or perhaps you don t like to be called my dear fellow and old man
please don t think it too familiar
raskolnikov sat down keeping his eyes fixed on him
in our domain the apologies for familiarity the french phrase were all characteristic signs
he held out both hands to me but he did not give me one he drew it back in time struck him suspiciously
both were watching each other but when their eyes met quick as lightning they looked away
i brought you this paper about the watch
is it all right or shall i copy it again
yes yes don t be uneasy it s all right porfiry petrovitch said as though in haste and after he had said it he took the paper and looked at it
nothing more is needed he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table
a minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from the table and put it on his bureau
i believe you said yesterday you would like to question me formally about my acquaintance with the murdered woman
raskolnikov was beginning again
why did i put in i believe passed through his mind in a flash
why am i so uneasy at having put in that came in a second flash
and he suddenly felt that his uneasiness at the mere contact with porfiry at the first words at the first looks had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions and that this was fearfully dangerous
his nerves were quivering his emotion was increasing
there s no hurry there s no hurry muttered porfiry petrovitch moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim as it were making dashes towards the window the bureau and the table at one moment avoiding raskolnikov s suspicious glance then again standing still and looking him straight in the face
his fat round little figure looked very strange like a ball rolling from one side to the other and rebounding back
he went on offering his visitor a cigarette
you know i am receiving you here but my own quarters are through there you know my government quarters
but i am living outside for the time i had to have some repairs done here
government quarters you know are a capital thing
yes a capital thing answered raskolnikov looking at him almost ironically
a capital thing a capital thing repeated porfiry petrovitch as though he had just thought of something quite different
yes a capital thing he almost shouted at last suddenly staring at raskolnikov and stopping short two steps from him
this stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the serious brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor
but this stirred raskolnikov s spleen more than ever and he could not resist an ironical and rather incautious challenge
tell me please he asked suddenly looking almost insolently at him and taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence
i believe it s a sort of legal rule a sort of legal tradition for all investigating lawyers to begin their attack from afar with a trivial or at least an irrelevant subject so as to encourage or rather to divert the man they are to disarm his caution and then all at once to give him an unexpected blow with some fatal question
it s a sacred tradition mentioned i fancy in all the manuals of the art
why do you imagine that was why i spoke about government quarters eh
and as he said this porfiry petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked a crafty look passed over his face
the wrinkles on his forehead were smoothed out his eyes contracted his features broadened and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh shaking all over and looking raskolnikov straight in the face
the latter forced himself to laugh too but when porfiry seeing that he was laughing broke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson raskolnikov s repulsion overcame all precaution he left off laughing scowled and stared with hatred at porfiry keeping his eyes fixed on him while his intentionally prolonged laughter lasted
there was lack of precaution on both sides however for porfiry petrovitch seemed to be laughing in his visitor s face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with which the visitor received it
the latter fact was very significant in raskolnikov s eyes he saw that porfiry petrovitch had not been embarrassed just before either but that he raskolnikov had perhaps fallen into a trap that there must be something some motive here unknown to him that perhaps everything was in readiness and in another moment would break upon him
he went straight to the point at once rose from his seat and took his cap
porfiry petrovitch he began resolutely though with considerable irritation yesterday you expressed a desire that i should come to you for some inquiries he laid special stress on the word inquiries
i have come and if you have anything to ask me ask it and if not allow me to withdraw
i have to be at the funeral of that man who was run over of whom you know also he added feeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at his anger
i am sick of it all do you hear
in short he shouted feeling that the phrase about his illness was still more out of place in short kindly examine me or let me go at once
and if you must examine me do so in the proper form
i will not allow you to do so otherwise and so meanwhile as we have evidently nothing to keep us now
what shall i question you about cackled porfiry petrovitch with a change of tone instantly leaving off laughing
please don t disturb yourself he began fidgeting from place to place and fussily making raskolnikov sit down
there s no hurry there s no hurry it s all nonsense
oh no i m very glad you ve come to see me at last
i look upon you simply as a visitor
and as for my confounded laughter please excuse it rodion romanovitch
it s my nerves you tickled me so with your witty observation i assure you sometimes i shake with laughter like an ball for half an hour at a time
i m often afraid of an attack of paralysis
please do or i shall think you are angry
raskolnikov did not speak he listened watching him still frowning angrily
he did sit down but still held his cap
i must tell you one thing about myself my dear rodion romanovitch porfiry petrovitch continued moving about the room and again avoiding his visitor s eyes
you see i m a bachelor a man of no consequence and not used to society besides i have nothing before me i m set i m running to seed and and have you noticed rodion romanovitch that in our petersburg circles if two clever men meet who are not intimate but respect each other like you and me it takes them half an hour before they can find a subject for conversation they are dumb they sit opposite each other and feel awkward
everyone has subjects of conversation ladies for instance people in high society always have their subjects of conversation est de but people of the middle sort like us thinking people that is are always and awkward
whether it is the lack of public interest or whether it is we are so honest we don t want to deceive one another i don t know
do put down your cap it looks as if you were just going it makes me uncomfortable
raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of porfiry petrovitch
does he really want to distract my attention with his silly babble
i can t offer you coffee here but why not spend five minutes with a friend
porfiry pattered on and you know all these official duties please don t mind my running up and down excuse it my dear fellow i am very much afraid of offending you but exercise is absolutely indispensable for me
i m always sitting and so glad to be moving about for five minutes
i suffer from my sedentary life
i always intend to join a gymnasium they say that officials of all ranks even privy councillors may be seen skipping gaily there there you have it modern science
but as for my duties here inquiries and all such formalities
you mentioned inquiries yourself just now
i assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for the interrogator than for the interrogated
you made the observation yourself just now very aptly and wittily
raskolnikov had made no observation of the kind
one keeps harping on the same note like a drum
there is to be a reform and we shall be called by a different name at least
and as for our legal tradition as you so wittily called it i thoroughly agree with you
every prisoner on trial even the rudest peasant knows that they begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions as you so happily put it and then deal him a blow your felicitous comparison
so you really imagined that i meant by government quarters
you spoke of formality just now apropos of the inquiry you know
but what s the use of formality
sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets a good deal more out of it
one can always fall back on formality allow me to assure you
and after all what does it amount to
an examining lawyer can not be bounded by formality at every step
the work of investigation is so to speak a free art in its own way
porfiry petrovitch took breath a moment
he had simply babbled on uttering empty phrases letting slip a few enigmatic words and again reverting to incoherence
he was almost running about the room moving his fat little legs quicker and quicker looking at the ground with his right hand behind his back while with his left making gesticulations that were extraordinarily incongruous with his words
raskolnikov suddenly noticed that as he ran about the room he seemed twice to stop for a moment near the door as though he were listening
you are certainly quite right about it porfiry began gaily looking with extraordinary simplicity at raskolnikov which startled him and instantly put him on his guard certainly quite right in laughing so wittily at our legal forms
some of these elaborate psychological methods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless if one adheres too closely to the forms
well if i recognise or more strictly speaking if i suspect someone or other to be a criminal in any case entrusted to me you re reading for the law of course rodion romanovitch
well then it is a precedent for you for the future though don t suppose i should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish about crime
no i simply make bold to state it by way of fact if i took this man or that for a criminal why i ask should i worry him prematurely even though i had evidence against him
in one case i may be bound for instance to arrest a man at once but another may be in quite a different position you know so why shouldn t i let him walk about the town a bit
but i see you don t quite understand so i ll give you a clearer example
if i put him in prison too soon i may very likely give him so to speak moral support
raskolnikov had no idea of laughing
he was sitting with compressed lips his feverish eyes fixed on porfiry petrovitch s
yet that is the case with some types especially for men are so different
but evidence you know can generally be taken two ways
i am an examining lawyer and a weak man i confess it
i should like to make a proof so to say mathematically clear
i should like to make a chain of evidence such as twice two are four it ought to be a direct irrefutable proof
and if i shut him up too soon even though i might be convinced was the man i should very likely be depriving myself of the means of getting further evidence against him
by giving him so to speak a definite position i shall put him out of suspense and set his mind at rest so that he will retreat into his shell
they say that at sevastopol soon after alma the clever people were in a terrible fright that the enemy would attack openly and take sevastopol at once
but when they saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege they were delighted i am told and reassured for the thing would drag on for two months at least
you re laughing you don t believe me again
these are special cases i admit
but you must observe this my dear rodion romanovitch the general case the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended for which they are calculated and laid down in books does not exist at all for the reason that every case every crime for instance so soon as it actually occurs at once becomes a thoroughly special case and sometimes a case unlike any that s gone before
very comic cases of that sort sometimes occur
if i leave one man quite alone if i don t touch him and don t worry him but let him know or at least suspect every moment that i know all about it and am watching him day and night and if he is in continual suspicion and terror he ll be bound to lose his head
he ll come of himself or maybe do something which will make it as plain as twice two are four it s delightful
it may be so with a simple peasant but with one of our sort an intelligent man cultivated on a certain side it s a dead certainty
for my dear fellow it s a very important matter to know on what side a man is cultivated
and then there are nerves there are nerves you have overlooked them
why they are all sick nervous and irritable
and then how they all suffer from spleen
that i assure you is a regular for us
and it s no anxiety to me his running about the town free
let him let him walk about for a bit
i know well enough that i ve caught him and that he won t escape me
a pole will escape abroad but not here especially as i am watching and have taken measures
will he escape into the depths of the country perhaps
but you know peasants live there real rude russian peasants
a modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such strangers as our peasants
but that s all nonsense and on the surface
it s not merely that he has nowhere to run to he is unable to escape me
through a law of nature he can t escape me if he had anywhere to go
have you seen a butterfly round a candle
that s how he will keep circling and circling round me
freedom will lose its attractions
he ll begin to brood he ll weave a tangle round himself he ll worry himself to death
what s more he will provide me with a mathematical proof if i only give him long enough interval
and he ll keep circling round me getting nearer and nearer and then flop
he ll fly straight into my mouth and i ll swallow him and that will be very amusing
raskolnikov made no reply he sat pale and motionless still gazing with the same intensity into porfiry s face
it s a lesson he thought turning cold
this is beyond the cat playing with a mouse like yesterday
he can t be showing off his power with no motive prompting me he is far too clever for that
it s all nonsense my friend you are pretending to scare me
you ve no proofs and the man i saw had no real existence
you simply want to make me lose my head to work me up beforehand and so to crush me
but you are wrong you won t do it
is he reckoning on my shattered nerves
no my friend you are wrong you won t do it even though you have some trap for me let us see what you have in store for me
and he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal
at times he longed to fall on porfiry and strangle him
this anger was what he dreaded from the beginning
he felt that his parched lips were flecked with foam his heart was throbbing
but he was still determined not to speak till the right moment
he realised that this was the best policy in his position because instead of saying too much he would be irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too freely
anyhow this was what he hoped for
no i see you don t believe me you think i am playing a harmless joke on you porfiry began again getting more and more lively chuckling at every instant and again pacing round the room
and to be sure you re right god has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in other people a buffoon but let me tell you and i repeat it excuse an old man my dear rodion romanovitch you are a man still young so to say in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything like all young people
playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and that s for all the world like the old austrian as far as i can judge of military matters that is on paper they d beaten napoleon and taken him prisoner and there in their study they worked it all out in the cleverest fashion but look you general mack surrendered with all his army
i see i see rodion romanovitch you are laughing at a civilian like me taking examples out of military history
but i can t help it it s my weakness
and i m ever so fond of reading all military histories
i ve certainly missed my proper career
i ought to have been in the army upon my word i ought
i shouldn t have been a napoleon but i might have been a major
well i ll tell you the whole truth my dear fellow about this i mean actual fact and a man s temperament my dear sir are weighty matters and it s astonishing how they sometimes deceive the sharpest calculation
i listen to an old man am speaking seriously rodion romanovitch as he said this porfiry petrovitch who was scarcely actually seemed to have grown old even his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together
moreover i m a candid man am i a candid man or not
i fancy i really am i tell you these things for nothing and don t even expect a reward for it
well to proceed wit in my opinion is a splendid thing it is so to say an adornment of nature and a consolation of life and what tricks it can play
so that it sometimes is hard for a poor examining lawyer to know where he is especially when he s liable to be carried away by his own fancy too for you know he is a man after all
but the poor fellow is saved by the criminal s temperament worse luck for him
but young people carried away by their own wit don t think of that when they overstep all obstacles as you wittily and cleverly expressed it yesterday
he will lie that is the man who is a the incognito and he will lie well in the cleverest fashion you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit but at the most interesting the most flagrant moment he will faint
of course there may be illness and a stuffy room as well but anyway
he lied incomparably but he didn t reckon on his temperament
another time he will be carried away by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him he will turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead but his paleness will be too much like the real thing again he has given us an idea
though his questioner may be deceived at first he will think differently next day if he is not a fool and of course it is like that at every step
he puts himself forward where he is not wanted speaks continually when he ought to keep silent brings in all sorts of allegorical allusions
comes and asks why didn t you take me long ago
and that can happen you know with the cleverest man the psychologist the literary man
the temperament reflects everything like a mirror
gaze into it and admire what you see
but why are you so pale rodion romanovitch
oh don t trouble please cried raskolnikov
and he suddenly broke into a laugh
porfiry stood facing him paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed
raskolnikov got up from the sofa abruptly checking his hysterical laughter
porfiry petrovitch he began speaking loudly and distinctly though his legs trembled and he could scarcely stand
i see clearly at last that you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister lizaveta
let me tell you for my part that i am sick of this
if you find that you have a right to prosecute me legally to arrest me then prosecute me arrest me
but i will not let myself be jeered at to my face and worried
his lips trembled his eyes glowed with fury and he could not restrain his voice
he shouted bringing his fist down on the table
do you hear that porfiry petrovitch
what does it mean cried porfiry petrovitch apparently quite frightened
rodion romanovitch my dear fellow what is the matter with you
i won t allow it raskolnikov shouted again
just think what could we say to them
porfiry petrovitch whispered in horror bringing his face close to raskolnikov s
i won t allow it i won t allow it raskolnikov repeated mechanically but he too spoke in a sudden whisper
porfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window
and you must have some water my dear fellow
and he was running to the door to call for some when he found a decanter of water in the corner
come drink a little he whispered rushing up to him with the decanter
porfiry petrovitch s alarm and sympathy were so natural that raskolnikov was silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity
he did not take the water however
rodion romanovitch my dear fellow you ll drive yourself out of your mind i assure you ach ach
have some water do drink a little
he forced him to take the glass
raskolnikov raised it mechanically to his lips but set it on the table again with disgust
you ll bring back your illness again my dear fellow porfiry petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy though he still looked rather disconcerted
good heavens you must take more care of yourself
dmitri prokofitch was here came to see me yesterday i know i know i ve a nasty ironical temper but what they made of it
good heavens he came yesterday after you d been
we dined and he talked and talked away and i could only throw up my hands in despair
but do sit down for mercy s sake sit down
no not from me but i knew he went to you and why he went raskolnikov answered sharply
what of it why this rodion romanovitch that i know more than that about you i know about everything
i know how you went take a at night when it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood so that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it
yes i understand your state of mind at that time
but you ll drive yourself mad like that upon my word
you re full of generous indignation at the wrongs you ve received first from destiny and then from the police officers and so you rush from one thing to another to force them to speak out and make an end of it all because you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness
i have guessed how you feel haven t i
only in that way you ll lose your head and razumihin s too he s too
a man for such a position you must know that
you are ill and he is good and your illness is infectious for him
i ll tell you about it when you are more yourself
but do sit down for goodness sake
please rest you look shocking do sit down
raskolnikov sat down he no longer shivered he was hot all over
in amazement he listened with strained attention to porfiry petrovitch who still seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude
but he did not believe a word he said though he felt a strange inclination to believe
porfiry s unexpected words about the flat had utterly overwhelmed him
how can it be he knows about the flat then he thought suddenly and he tells it me himself
yes in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar a case of morbid psychology porfiry went on quickly
a man confessed to murder and how he kept it up
it was a regular hallucination he brought forward facts he imposed upon everyone and why
he had been partly but only partly unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that he had given the murderers the opportunity he sank into dejection it got on his mind and turned his brain he began imagining things and he persuaded himself that he was the murderer
but at last the high court of appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under proper care
why my dear fellow you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse to work upon your nerves to go ringing bells at night and asking about blood
i ve studied all this morbid psychology in my practice
a man is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry
it s all illness rodion romanovitch
you have begun to neglect your illness
you should consult an experienced doctor what s the good of that fat fellow
you were delirious when you did all this
for a moment raskolnikov felt everything going round
is it possible is it possible flashed through his mind that he is still lying
he rejected that idea feeling to what a degree of fury it might drive him feeling that that fury might drive him mad
i knew what i was doing he cried straining every faculty to penetrate porfiry s game i was quite myself do you hear
you said yesterday you were not delirious you were particularly emphatic about it
i understand all you can tell me
listen rodion romanovitch my dear fellow
if you were actually a criminal or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession of your faculties
and so emphatically and persistently
quite impossible to my thinking
if you had anything on your conscience you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious
there was a note of slyness in this inquiry
raskolnikov drew back on the sofa as porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at him
another thing about razumihin you certainly ought to have said that he came of his own accord to have concealed your part in it
you lay stress on his coming at your instigation
you keep telling lies he said slowly and weakly twisting his lips into a sickly smile you are trying again to show that you know all my game that you know all i shall say beforehand he said conscious himself that he was not weighing his words as he ought
you want to frighten me or you are simply laughing at me
he still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of intense hatred in his eyes
you know perfectly well that the best policy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible to conceal as little as possible
porfiry tittered there s no catching you you ve a perfect monomania
but still you do believe me you believe a quarter i ll soon make you believe the whole because i have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you good
yes i do went on porfiry touching raskolnikov s arm genially you must take care of your illness
besides your mother and sister are here now you must think of them
you must soothe and comfort them and you do nothing but frighten them
you are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it
why i learnt it all from you yourself
you don t notice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything
from razumihin too i learnt a number of interesting details yesterday
no you interrupted me but i must tell you that for all your wit your suspiciousness makes you lose the view of things
i an examining lawyer have betrayed a precious thing like that a real fact for it is a fact worth having and you see nothing in it
why if i had the slightest suspicion of you should i have acted like that
no i should first have disarmed your suspicions and not let you see i knew of that fact should have diverted your attention and suddenly have dealt you a blow your expression saying and what were you doing sir pray at ten or nearly eleven at the murdered woman s flat and why did you ring the bell and why did you ask about blood
and why did you invite the porters to go with you to the police station to the lieutenant
that s how i ought to have acted if i had a grain of suspicion of you
i ought to have taken your evidence in due form searched your lodging and perhaps have arrested you too
so i have no suspicion of you since i have not done that
but you can t look at it normally
and you see nothing i say again
raskolnikov started so that porfiry petrovitch could not fail to perceive it
you are lying all the while he cried i don t know your object but you are lying
you did not speak like that just now and i can not be mistaken
porfiry repeated apparently incensed but preserving a and ironical face as though he were not in the least concerned at raskolnikov s opinion of him
but how did i treat you just now i the examining lawyer
prompting you and giving you every means for your defence illness i said delirium injury melancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it
though indeed all those psychological means of defence are not very reliable and cut both ways illness delirium i don t remember that s all right but why my good sir in your illness and in your delirium were you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others
raskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him
briefly he said loudly and imperiously rising to his feet and in so doing pushing porfiry back a little briefly i want to know do you acknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not
tell me porfiry petrovitch tell me once for all and make haste
what a business i m having with you cried porfiry with a perfectly sly and composed face
and why do you want to know why do you want to know so much since they haven t begun to worry you
why you are like a child asking for matches
why do you force yourself upon us eh
i repeat raskolnikov cried furiously that i can t put up with it
with what uncertainty interrupted porfiry
and i won t do you hear do you hear
he shouted bringing his fist down on the table again
i warn you seriously take care of yourself
i am not joking porfiry whispered but this time there was not the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face
now he was peremptory stern frowning and for once laying aside all mystification
but this was only for an instant
raskolnikov bewildered suddenly fell into actual frenzy but strange to say he again obeyed the command to speak quietly though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury
i will not allow myself to be tortured he whispered instantly recognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and driven to even greater fury by the thought
arrest me search me but kindly act in due form and don t play with me
don t worry about the form porfiry interrupted with the same sly smile as it were gloating with enjoyment over raskolnikov
i invited you to see me quite in a friendly way
i don t want your friendship and i spit on it
what will you say now if you mean to arrest me
he took up his cap and went to the door
and won t you see my little surprise chuckled porfiry again taking him by the arm and stopping him at the door
he seemed to become more playful and which maddened raskolnikov
he asked standing still and looking at porfiry in alarm
my little surprise it s sitting there behind the door
i locked him in that he should not escape
raskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it but it was locked
and he brought a key out of his pocket
you are lying roared raskolnikov without restraint you lie you damned punchinello
and he rushed at porfiry who retreated to the other door not at all alarmed
you are lying and mocking so that i may betray myself to you
why you could not betray yourself any further my dear rodion romanovitch
don t shout i shall call the clerks
you knew i was ill and tried to work me into a frenzy to make me betray myself that was your object
you ve no evidence you have only wretched rubbishly suspicions like zametov s
you knew my character you wanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and deputies
what things people will imagine
and to do so would not be acting in form as you say you don t know the business my dear fellow
and there s no escaping form as you see porfiry muttered listening at the door through which a noise could be heard
ah they re coming cried raskolnikov
well produce them all your deputies your witnesses what you like
but at this moment a strange incident occurred something so unexpected that neither raskolnikov nor porfiry petrovitch could have looked for such a conclusion to their interview
chapter vi when he remembered the scene afterwards this is how raskolnikov saw it
the noise behind the door increased and suddenly the door was opened a little
what is it cried porfiry petrovitch annoyed
for an instant there was no answer but it was evident that there were several persons at the door and that they were apparently pushing somebody back
porfiry petrovitch repeated uneasily
the prisoner nikolay has been brought someone answered
how irregular cried porfiry rushing to the door
but he began the same voice and suddenly ceased
two seconds not more were spent in actual struggle then someone gave a violent shove and then a man very pale strode into the room
this man s appearance was at first sight very strange
he stared straight before him as though seeing nothing
there was a determined gleam in his eyes at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his face as though he were being led to the scaffold
his white lips were faintly twitching
he was dressed like a workman and was of medium height very young slim his hair cut in round crop with thin spare features
the man whom he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing him by the shoulder he was a warder but nikolay pulled his arm away
several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway
all this took place almost instantaneously
why have you brought him so soon
porfiry petrovitch muttered extremely annoyed and as it were thrown out of his reckoning
but nikolay suddenly knelt down
what s the matter cried porfiry surprised
i am the murderer nikolay articulated suddenly rather breathless but speaking fairly loudly
for ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb even the warder stepped back mechanically retreated to the door and stood immovable
what is it cried porfiry petrovitch recovering from his momentary stupefaction
i am the murderer repeated nikolay after a brief pause
what you what whom did you kill
porfiry petrovitch was obviously bewildered
nikolay again was silent for a moment
alyona ivanovna and her sister lizaveta ivanovna i killed with an axe
darkness came over me he added suddenly and was again silent
porfiry petrovitch stood for some moments as though meditating but suddenly roused himself and waved back the uninvited spectators
they instantly vanished and closed the door
then he looked towards raskolnikov who was standing in the corner staring wildly at nikolay and moved towards him but stopped short looked from nikolay to raskolnikov and then again at nikolay and seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter
you re in too great a hurry he shouted at him almost angrily
i didn t ask you what came over you
i want to give evidence nikolay pronounced
nikolay did not understand the question
and mitka is not guilty and had no share in it
don t be in a hurry about mitka
how was it you ran downstairs like that at the time
it was to put them off the scent
i ran after mitka nikolay replied hurriedly as though he had prepared the answer
it s not his own tale he is telling he muttered as though to himself and suddenly his eyes rested on raskolnikov again
he was apparently so taken up with nikolay that for a moment he had forgotten raskolnikov
my dear rodion romanovitch excuse me
he flew up to him this won t do i m afraid you must go it s no good your staying
and taking him by the arm he showed him to the door
i suppose you didn t expect it said raskolnikov who though he had not yet fully grasped the situation had regained his courage
you did not expect it either my friend
you re trembling too porfiry petrovitch
they were already at the door porfiry was impatient for raskolnikov to be gone
and your little surprise aren t you going to show it to me
why his teeth are chattering as he asks
that s in god s hands muttered porfiry with an unnatural smile
as he walked through the office raskolnikov noticed that many people were looking at him
among them he saw the two porters from house whom he had invited that night to the police station
but he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of porfiry petrovitch behind him
turning round he saw the latter running after him out of breath
one word rodion romanovitch as to all the rest it s in god s hands but as a matter of form there are some questions i shall have to ask you
so we shall meet again shan t we
and porfiry stood still facing him with a smile
he seemed to want to say something more but could not speak out
you must forgive me porfiry petrovitch for what has just passed
i lost my temper began raskolnikov who had so far regained his courage that he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness
don t mention it don t mention it porfiry replied almost gleefully
i myself too i have a wicked temper i admit it
if it s god s will we may see a great deal of one another
and will get to know each other through and through added raskolnikov
yes know each other through and through assented porfiry petrovitch and he screwed up his eyes looking earnestly at raskolnikov
now you re going to a birthday party
take care of yourself and get well
i don t know what to wish you said raskolnikov who had begun to descend the stairs but looked back again
i should like to wish you success but your office is such a comical one
porfiry petrovitch had turned to go but he seemed to prick up his ears at this
why how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor nikolay psychologically after your fashion till he confessed
you must have been at him day and night proving to him that he was the murderer and now that he has confessed you ll begin vivisecting him again
it s not your own tale you are telling
you must admit it s a comical business
you noticed then that i said to nikolay just now that it was not his own tale he was telling
and you always fasten on the comic side
they say that was the marked characteristic of gogol among the writers
i shall look forward to meeting you
so shall raskolnikov walked straight home
he was so muddled and bewildered that on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa trying to collect his thoughts
he did not attempt to think about nikolay he was stupefied he felt that his confession was something inexplicable amazing something beyond his understanding
but nikolay s confession was an actual fact
the consequences of this fact were clear to him at once its falsehood could not fail to be discovered and then they would be after him again
till then at least he was free and must do something for himself for the danger was imminent
his position gradually became clear to him
remembering sketchily the main outlines of his recent scene with porfiry he could not help shuddering again with horror
of course he did not yet know all porfiry s aims he could not see into all his calculations
but he had already partly shown his hand and no one knew better than raskolnikov how terrible porfiry s lead had been for him
a little more and he have given himself away completely circumstantially
knowing his nervous temperament and from the first glance seeing through him porfiry though playing a bold game was bound to win
there s no denying that raskolnikov had compromised himself seriously but no had come to light as yet there was nothing positive
but was he taking a true view of the position
what had porfiry been trying to get at
had he really some surprise prepared for him
had he really been expecting something or not
how would they have parted if it had not been for the unexpected appearance of nikolay
porfiry had shown almost all his cards of course he had risked something in showing them and if he had really had anything up his sleeve raskolnikov reflected he would have shown that too
could it have concealed anything like a fact a piece of positive evidence
if porfiry really had any evidence it must be connected with him
he sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in his hands
he was still shivering nervously
at last he got up took his cap thought a minute and went to the door
he had a sort of presentiment that for at least he might consider himself out of danger
he had a sudden sense almost of joy he wanted to make haste to katerina ivanovna s
he would be too late for the funeral of course but he would be in time for the memorial dinner and there at once he would see sonia
he stood still thought a moment and a suffering smile came for a moment on to his lips
but as he was about to open the door it began opening of itself
the door opened gently and slowly and there suddenly appeared a figure yesterday s visitor
the man stood in the doorway looked at raskolnikov without speaking and took a step forward into the room
he was exactly the same as yesterday the same figure the same dress but there was a great change in his face he looked dejected and sighed deeply
if he had only put his hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have looked exactly like a peasant woman
asked raskolnikov numb with terror
the man was still silent but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground touching it with his finger
i have sinned the man articulated softly
when you came perhaps in drink and bade the porters go to the police station and asked about the blood i was vexed that they let you go and took you for drunken
i was so vexed that i lost my sleep
and remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for you
raskolnikov interrupted instantly beginning to recollect
i was standing at the gate with them don t you remember
we have carried on our trade in that house for years past
we cure and prepare hides we take work home
and the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came clearly before raskolnikov s mind he recollected that there had been several people there besides the porters women among them
he remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the
he could not recall the face of the speaker and even now he did not recognise it but he remembered that he had turned round and made him some answer
so this was the solution of yesterday s horror
the most awful thought was that he had been actually almost lost had almost done for himself on account of such a circumstance
so this man could tell nothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains
so porfiry too had nothing but that no facts but this which both nothing positive
so if no more facts come to light and they must not they must not
then then what can they do to him
how can they convict him even if they arrest him
and porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not known about it before
was it you who told porfiry that i d been there
he cried struck by a sudden idea
the head of the detective department
the porters did not go there but i went
i got there two minutes before you
and i heard i heard it all how he worried you
i was sitting there all the time
i saw that the porters did not want to do what i said began the man for it s too late said they and maybe he ll be angry that we did not come at the time
i was vexed and i lost my sleep and i began making inquiries
and finding out yesterday where to go i went
the first time i went he wasn t there when i came an hour later he couldn t see me
i went the third time and they showed me in
i informed him of everything just as it happened and he began skipping about the room and punching himself on the chest
what do you scoundrels mean by it
if i d known about it i should have arrested him
then he ran out called somebody and began talking to him in the corner then he turned to me scolding and questioning me
he scolded me a great deal and i told him everything and i told him that you didn t dare to say a word in answer to me yesterday and that you didn t recognise me
and he fell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest and getting angry and running about and when you were announced he told me to go into the next room
don t move whatever you may hear
and he set a chair there for me and locked me in
and when nikolay d been brought he let me out as soon as you were gone
i shall send for you again and question you he said
and did he question nikolay while you were there
he got rid of me as he did of you before he spoke to nikolay
the man stood still and again suddenly bowed down touching the ground with his finger
forgive me for my evil thoughts and my slander
may god forgive you answered raskolnikov
and as he said this the man bowed down again but not to the ground turned slowly and went out of the room
it all cuts both ways now it all cuts both ways repeated raskolnikov and he went out more confident than ever
now we ll make a fight for it he said with a malicious smile as he went down the stairs
his malice was aimed at himself with shame and contempt he recollected his cowardice
i the morning that followed the fateful interview with dounia and her mother brought sobering influences to bear on pyotr petrovitch
intensely unpleasant as it was he was forced little by little to accept as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before fantastic and incredible
the black snake of wounded vanity had been gnawing at his heart all night
when he got out of bed pyotr petrovitch immediately looked in the
he was afraid that he had jaundice
however his health seemed unimpaired so far and looking at his noble countenance which had grown fattish of late pyotr petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the conviction that he would find another bride and perhaps even a better one
but coming back to the sense of his present position he turned aside and spat vigorously which excited a sarcastic smile in andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov the young friend with whom he was staying
that smile pyotr petrovitch noticed and at once set it down against his young friend s account
he had set down a good many points against him of late
his anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to have told andrey semyonovitch about the result of yesterday s interview
that was the second mistake he had made in temper through impulsiveness and irritability
moreover all that morning one unpleasantness followed another
he even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case in the senate
he was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being redecorated at his own expense the owner a rich german tradesman would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money though pyotr petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated
in the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the flat
am i to get married simply for the sake of the furniture
pyotr petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a gleam of desperate hope
can all that be really so irrevocably over
is it no use to make another effort
the thought of dounia sent a voluptuous pang through his heart
he endured anguish at that moment and if it had been possible to slay raskolnikov instantly by wishing it pyotr petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish
it was my mistake too not to have given them money he thought as he returned dejectedly to lebeziatnikov s room and why on earth was i such a jew
i meant to keep them without a penny so that they should turn to me as their providence and look at them
if i d spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau and presents on jewellery materials and all that sort of trash from knopp s and the english shop my position would have been better and stronger
they could not have refused me so easily
they are the sort of people that would feel bound to return money and presents if they broke it off and they would find it hard to do it
and their conscience would prick them how can we dismiss a man who has hitherto been so generous and delicate
and grinding his teeth again pyotr petrovitch called himself a fool but not aloud of course
he returned home twice as irritated and angry as before
the preparations for the funeral dinner at katerina ivanovna s excited his curiosity as he passed
he had heard about it the day before he fancied indeed that he had been invited but absorbed in his own cares he had paid no attention
inquiring of madame lippevechsel who was busy laying the table while katerina ivanovna was away at the cemetery he heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair that all the lodgers had been invited among them some who had not known the dead man that even andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of his previous quarrel with katerina ivanovna that he pyotr petrovitch was not only invited but was eagerly expected as he was the most important of the lodgers
amalia ivanovna herself had been invited with great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness and so she was very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them she was moreover dressed up to the nines all in new black silk and she was proud of it
all this suggested an idea to pyotr petrovitch and he went into his room or rather lebeziatnikov s somewhat thoughtful
he had learnt that raskolnikov was to be one of the guests
andrey semyonovitch had been at home all the morning
the attitude of pyotr petrovitch to this gentleman was strange though perhaps natural
pyotr petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him
he had not come to stay with him on his arrival in petersburg simply from parsimony though that had been perhaps his chief object
he had heard of andrey semyonovitch who had once been his ward as a leading young progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting circles the doings of which were a legend in the provinces
it had impressed pyotr petrovitch
these powerful omniscient circles who despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a peculiar but quite vague alarm
he had not of course been able to form even an approximate notion of what they meant
he like everyone had heard that there were especially in petersburg progressives of some sort nihilists and so on and like many people he exaggerated and distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree
what for many years past he had feared more than anything was shown and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the thought of transferring his business to petersburg
he was afraid of this as little children are sometimes
some years before when he was just entering on his own career he had come upon two cases in which rather important personages in the province patrons of his had been cruelly shown up
one instance had ended in great scandal for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious trouble
for this reason pyotr petrovitch intended to go into the subject as soon as he reached petersburg and if necessary to anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of our younger generation
he relied on andrey semyonovitch for this and before his visit to raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current phrases
he soon discovered that andrey semyonovitch was a commonplace simpleton but that by no means reassured pyotr petrovitch
even if he had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him it would not have allayed his uneasiness
all the doctrines the ideas the systems with which andrey semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for him
he had his own object he simply wanted to find out at once what was happening
had these people any power or not
had he anything to fear from them
would they expose any enterprise of his
and what precisely was now the object of their attacks
could he somehow make up to them and get round them if they really were powerful
was this the thing to do or not
couldn t he gain something through them
in fact hundreds of questions presented themselves
andrey semyonovitch was an an√¶mic scrofulous little man with strangely flaxen whiskers of which he was very proud
he was a clerk and had almost always something wrong with his eyes
he was rather but and sometimes extremely conceited in speech which had an absurd effect incongruous with his little figure
he was one of the lodgers most respected by amalia ivanovna for he did not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings
andrey semyonovitch really was rather stupid he attached himself to the cause of progress and our younger generation from enthusiasm
he was one of the numerous and varied legion of dullards of abortions conceited coxcombs who attach themselves to the idea most in fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve however sincerely
though lebeziatnikov was so he too was beginning to dislike pyotr petrovitch
this happened on both sides unconsciously
however simple andrey semyonovitch might be he began to see that pyotr petrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him and that he was not the right sort of man
he had tried expounding to him the system of fourier and the darwinian theory but of late pyotr petrovitch began to listen too sarcastically and even to be rude
the fact was he had begun instinctively to guess that lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace simpleton but perhaps a liar too and that he had no connections of any consequence even in his own circle but had simply picked things up and that very likely he did not even know much about his own work of propaganda for he was in too great a muddle
a fine person he would be to show anyone up
it must be noted by the way that pyotr petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest praise from andrey semyonovitch he had not protested for instance when andrey semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to the establishment of the new commune or to abstain from christening his future children or to acquiesce if dounia were to take a lover a month after marriage and so on
pyotr petrovitch so enjoyed hearing his own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they were attributed to him
pyotr petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted over bundles of notes
andrey semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank notes with indifference and even contempt
nothing would have convinced pyotr petrovitch that andrey semyonovitch could really look on the money unmoved and the latter on his side kept thinking bitterly that pyotr petrovitch was capable of entertaining such an idea about him and was perhaps glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend by reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them
he found him incredibly inattentive and irritable though he andrey semyonovitch began enlarging on his favourite subject the foundation of a new special commune
the brief remarks that dropped from pyotr petrovitch between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame betrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony
but the humane andrey semyonovitch ascribed pyotr petrovitch s to his recent breach with dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that theme
he had something progressive to say on the subject which might console his worthy friend and could not fail to promote his development
there is some sort of festivity being prepared at that at the widow s isn t there
pyotr petrovitch asked suddenly interrupting andrey semyonovitch at the most interesting passage
why i was telling you last night what i think about all such ceremonies
and she invited you too i heard
you were talking to her yesterday
i should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on this feast all the money she got from that other fool raskolnikov
i was surprised just now as i came through at the preparations there the wines
continued pyotr petrovitch who seemed to have some object in pursuing the conversation
i only said a word to her in passing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a year s salary as a destitute widow of a government clerk
i suppose she has invited me on that account hasn t she
i don t intend to go either said lebeziatnikov
i should think not after giving her a thrashing
whom cried lebeziatnikov flustered and blushing
why you thrashed katerina ivanovna a month ago
so that s what your convictions amount to and the woman question too wasn t quite sound
and pyotr petrovitch as though comforted went back to clicking his beads
cried lebeziatnikov who was always afraid of allusions to the subject
it was not like that at all it was quite different
you ve heard it wrong it s a libel
she rushed at me first with her nails she pulled out all my whiskers
it s permissable for anyone i should hope to defend himself and i never allow anyone to use violence to me on principle for it s an act of despotism
luzhin went on laughing maliciously
you keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself
and it has nothing nothing whatever to do with the woman question
you don t understand i used to think indeed that if women are equal to men in all respects even in strength as is maintained now there ought to be equality in that too
of course i reflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise for there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is unthinkable and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality in fighting
i am not so stupid though of course there is fighting there won t be later but at present there is confound it
it s not on that account that i am not going
i am not going on principle not to take part in the revolting convention of memorial dinners that s why
though of course one might go to laugh at it
i am sorry there won t be any priests at it
i should certainly go if there were
then you would sit down at another man s table and insult it and those who invited you
eh certainly not insult but protest
i should do it with a good object
i might indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda
it s a duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the more harshly perhaps the better
and something might grow up from that seed
they might be offended at first but afterwards they d see i d done them a service
you know terebyeva who is in the community now was blamed because when she left her family and devoted herself she wrote to her father and mother that she wouldn t go on living conventionally and was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh that she might have spared them and have written more kindly
i think that s all nonsense and there s no need of softness on the contrary what s wanted is protest
varents had been married seven years she abandoned her two children she told her husband straight out in a letter i have realised that i can not be happy with you
i can never forgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there is another organisation of society by means of the communities
i have only lately learned it from a man to whom i have given myself and with whom i am establishing a community
i speak plainly because i consider it dishonest to deceive you
do not hope to get me back you are too late
that s how letters like that ought to be written
is that terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage
but what if it were the fourth what if it were the fifteenth that s all nonsense
and if ever i regretted the death of my father and mother it is now and i sometimes think if my parents were living what a protest i would have aimed at them
i would have done something on purpose
i am really sorry there is no one
well be that as you will pyotr petrovitch interrupted but tell me this do you know the dead man s daughter the little thing
it s true what they say about her isn t it what of it
i think that is it is my own personal conviction that this is the normal condition of women
in our present society it is not altogether normal because it is compulsory but in the future society it will be perfectly normal because it will be voluntary
even as it is she was quite right she was suffering and that was her asset so to speak her capital which she had a perfect right to dispose of
of course in the future society there will be no need of assets but her part will have another significance rational and in harmony with her environment
as to sofya semyonovna personally i regard her action as a vigorous protest against the organisation of society and i respect her deeply for it i rejoice indeed when i look at her
i was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings
that s another slander he yelled
that was all katerina ivanovna s invention for she did not understand
and i never made love to sofya semyonovna
i was simply developing her entirely disinterestedly trying to rouse her to protest
all i wanted was her protest and sofya semyonovna could not have remained here anyway
have you asked her to join your community
you keep on laughing and very inappropriately allow me to tell you
there is no such r√¥le in a community
the community is established that there should be no such r√¥les
in a community such a r√¥le is essentially transformed and what is stupid here is sensible there what under present conditions is unnatural becomes perfectly natural in the community
it all depends on the environment
it s all the environment and man himself is nothing
and i am on good terms with sofya semyonovna to this day which is a proof that she never regarded me as having wronged her
i am trying now to attract her to the community but on quite quite a different footing
we are trying to establish a community of our own a special one on a broader basis
we have gone further in our convictions
and meanwhile i m still developing sofya semyonovna
she has a beautiful beautiful character
and you take advantage of her fine character eh
in fact i feel it strange myself how timid chaste and modern she is with me
and you of course are developing her
trying to prove to her that all that modesty is nonsense
how coarsely how stupidly excuse me saying so you misunderstand the word development
good heavens how crude you still are
we are striving for the freedom of women and you have only one idea in your head
setting aside the general question of chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed prejudices i fully accept her chastity with me because that s for her to decide
of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me i should think myself very lucky because i like the girl very much but as it is no one has ever treated her more courteously than i with more respect for her dignity
you had much better make her a present of something
i bet you never thought of that
you don t understand as i ve told you already
of course she is in such a position but it s another question
seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider deserving of contempt you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow creature
you don t know what a character she is
i am only sorry that of late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books
i am sorry too that with all the energy and resolution in protesting which she has already shown once she has little little so to say independence so as to break free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas
yet she thoroughly understands some questions for instance about kissing of hands that is that it s an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her hand because it s a sign of inequality
she listened attentively to an account of the workmen s associations in france too
now i am explaining the question of coming into the room in the future society
we had a debate lately on the question has a member of the community the right to enter another member s room whether man or woman at any time
it might be at an inconvenient moment
you are always thinking of something unpleasant he cried with aversion
how vexed i am that when i was expounding our system i referred prematurely to the question of personal privacy
it s always a to people like you they turn it into ridicule before they understand it
and how proud they are of it too
i ve often maintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till he has a firm faith in the system
and tell me please what do you find so shameful even in cesspools
i should be the first to be ready to clean out any cesspool you like
and it s not a question of it s simply work honourable useful work which is as good as any other and much better than the work of a raphael and a pushkin because it is more useful
and more honourable more honourable
what do you mean by more honourable
i don t understand such expressions to describe human activity
more honourable nobler all those are prejudices which i reject
everything which is to mankind is honourable
you can snigger as much as you like but that s so
pyotr petrovitch laughed heartily
he had finished counting the money and was putting it away
but some of the notes he left on the table
the cesspool question had already been a subject of dispute between them
what was absurd was that it made lebeziatnikov really angry while it amused luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted to anger his young friend
it s your yesterday that makes you so and annoying blurted out lebeziatnikov who in spite of his independence and his protests did not venture to oppose pyotr petrovitch and still behaved to him with some of the respect habitual in earlier years
you d better tell me this pyotr petrovitch interrupted with haughty displeasure can you or rather are you really friendly enough with that young person to ask her to step in here for a minute
i think they ve all come back from the cemetery
i want to see her that young person
lebeziatnikov asked with surprise
i am leaving here or and therefore i wanted to speak to her about
however you may be present during the interview
it s better you should be indeed
for there s no knowing what you might imagine
i only asked and if you ve anything to say to her nothing is easier than to call her in
i ll go directly and you may be sure i won t be in your way
five minutes later lebeziatnikov came in with sonia
she came in very much surprised and overcome with shyness as usual
she was always shy in such circumstances and was always afraid of new people she had been as a child and was even more so now
pyotr petrovitch met her politely and affably but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in his opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weight in dealing with a creature so young and so as she
he hastened to reassure her and made her sit down facing him at the table
sonia sat down looked about her at lebeziatnikov at the notes lying on the table and then again at pyotr petrovitch and her eyes remained riveted on him
lebeziatnikov was moving to the door
pyotr petrovitch signed to sonia to remain seated and stopped lebeziatnikov
has he come he asked him in a whisper
well i particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave me alone with this young woman
i only want a few words with her but god knows what they may make of it
i shouldn t like raskolnikov to repeat anything
of course i am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy but still you are right
i ll stand here at the window and not be in your way
pyotr petrovitch returned to the sofa sat down opposite sonia looked attentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified even severe expression as much as to say don t you make any mistake madam
sonia was overwhelmed with embarrassment
in the first place sofya semyonovna will you make my excuses to your respected mamma
katerina ivanovna stands in the place of a mother to you
pyotr petrovitch began with great dignity though affably
it was evident that his intentions were friendly
quite so yes the place of a mother sonia answered timidly and hurriedly
then will you make my apologies to her
through inevitable circumstances i am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in spite of your mamma s kind invitation
and sonia hastily jumped up from her seat
wait that s not all pyotr petrovitch detained her smiling at her simplicity and ignorance of good manners and you know me little my dear sofya semyonovna if you suppose i would have ventured to trouble a person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself only
her eyes rested again for an instant on the notes that remained on the table but she quickly looked away and fixed her eyes on pyotr petrovitch
she felt it horribly indecorous especially for to look at another person s money
she stared at the gold which pyotr petrovitch held in his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a yellow stone on his middle finger
but suddenly she looked away and not knowing where to turn ended by staring pyotr petrovitch again straight in the face
after a pause of still greater dignity he continued
i chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with katerina ivanovna poor woman
that was sufficient to enable me to ascertain that she is in a position preternatural if one may so express it
or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say ill
so then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak compassion i should be glad to be of service to her in any way foreseeing her unfortunate position
i believe the whole of this family depends now entirely on you
allow me to ask sonia rose to her feet did you say something to her yesterday of the possibility of a pension
because she told me you had undertaken to get her one
not in the slightest and indeed it s an absurdity i merely hinted at her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had died in the service if only she has patronage
but apparently your late parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the service at all of late
in fact if there could be any hope it would be very ephemeral because there would be no claim for assistance in that case far from it
and she is dreaming of a pension already
for she is credulous and and she believes everything from the goodness of her heart and and and she is like that
you must excuse her said sonia and again she got up to go
but you haven t heard what i have to say
no i haven t heard muttered sonia
she was terribly confused she sat down again a third time
seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones i should be glad as i have said before so far as lies in my power to be of service that is so far as is in my power not more
one might for instance get up a subscription for her or a lottery something of the sort such as is always arranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous of assisting people
it was of that i intended to speak to you it might be done
god will repay you for it faltered sonia gazing intently at pyotr petrovitch
it might be but we will talk of it later
we might begin it we will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak
lebeziatnikov i hope will assist us
but there is one circumstance of which i ought to warn you beforehand and for which i venture to trouble you sofya semyonovna to come here
in my opinion money can not be indeed it s unsafe to put it into katerina ivanovna s own hands
though she has not so to speak a crust of bread for and
well boots or shoes or anything she has bought jamaica rum and even i believe madeira and and coffee
it will all fall upon you again they won t have a crust of bread
it s absurd really and so to my thinking a subscription ought to be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money but only you for instance
i don t know this is only once in her life
she was so anxious to do honour to celebrate the memory
but just as you think and i shall be very very they will all be and god will reward and the orphans
very well then keep it in mind and now will you accept for the benefit of your relation the small sum that i am able to spare from me personally
i am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in connection with it
here having so to speak anxieties of my own i can not do more
and pyotr petrovitch held out to sonia a note carefully unfolded
sonia took it flushed crimson jumped up muttered something and began taking leave
pyotr petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously to the door
she got out of the room at last agitated and distressed and returned to katerina ivanovna overwhelmed with confusion
all this time lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the room anxious not to interrupt the conversation when sonia had gone he walked up to pyotr petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand
i heard and everything he said laying stress on the last verb
that is honourable i mean to say it s humane
you wanted to avoid gratitude i saw
and although i can not i confess in principle sympathise with private charity for it not only fails to eradicate the evil but even promotes it yet i must admit that i saw your action with pleasure yes yes i like it
that s all nonsense muttered pyotr petrovitch somewhat disconcerted looking carefully at lebeziatnikov
a man who has suffered distress and annoyance as you did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others such a man even though he is making a social mistake is still deserving of respect
i did not expect it indeed of you pyotr petrovitch especially as according to your ideas
oh what a drawback your ideas are to you
how distressed you are for instance by your yesterday cried the lebeziatnikov who felt a return of affection for pyotr petrovitch
and what do you want with marriage with marriage my dear noble pyotr petrovitch
why do you cling to this of marriage
well you may beat me if you like but i am glad positively glad it hasn t come off that you are free that you are not quite lost for humanity
because i don t want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and to bring up another man s children that s why i want legal marriage luzhin replied in order to make some answer
he seemed preoccupied by something
you referred to children lebeziatnikov started off like a warhorse at the trumpet call
children are a social question and a question of first importance i agree but the question of children has another solution
some refuse to have children altogether because they suggest the institution of the family
we ll speak of children later but now as to the question of honour i confess that s my weak point
that horrid military pushkin expression is unthinkable in the dictionary of the future
it s nonsense there will be no deception in a free marriage
that is only the natural consequence of a legal marriage so to say its corrective a protest
so that indeed it s not humiliating and if i ever to suppose an absurdity were to be legally married i should be positively glad of it
i should say to my wife my dear hitherto i have loved you now i respect you for you ve shown you can protest
that s because you are incapable of getting away from prejudices
i understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived in a legal marriage but it s simply a despicable consequence of a despicable position in which both are humiliated
when the deception is open as in a free marriage then it does not exist it s unthinkable
your wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you incapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for her new husband
i sometimes dream if i were to be married pfoo
i mean if i were to marry legally or not it s just the same i should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for herself
my dear i should say i love you but even more than that i desire you to respect me
pyotr petrovitch sniggered as he listened but without much merriment
he was preoccupied with something else and even lebeziatnikov at last noticed it
pyotr petrovitch seemed excited and rubbed his hands
lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected upon it afterwards
chapter ii it would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the idea of that senseless dinner in katerina ivanovna s disordered brain
nearly ten of the twenty roubles given by raskolnikov for marmeladov s funeral were wasted upon it
possibly katerina ivanovna felt obliged to honour the memory of the deceased suitably that all the lodgers and still more amalia ivanovna might know that he was in no way their inferior and perhaps very much their superior and that no one had the right to turn up his nose at him
perhaps the chief element was that peculiar poor man s pride which compels many poor people to spend their last savings on some traditional social ceremony simply in order to do like other people and not to be looked down upon
it is very probable too that katerina ivanovna longed on this occasion at the moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone to show those wretched contemptible lodgers that she knew how to do things how to entertain and that she had been brought up in a genteel she might almost say aristocratic colonel s family and had not been meant for sweeping floors and washing the children s rags at night
even the poorest and most people are sometimes liable to these paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible nervous craving
and katerina ivanovna was not she might have been killed by circumstance but her spirit could not have been broken that is she could not have been intimidated her will could not be crushed
moreover sonia had said with good reason that her mind was unhinged
she could not be said to be insane but for a year past she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained
the later stages of consumption are apt doctors tell us to affect the intellect
there was no great variety of wines nor was there madeira but wine there was
there was vodka rum and lisbon wine all of the poorest quality but in sufficient quantity
besides the traditional rice and honey there were three or four dishes one of which consisted of pancakes all prepared in amalia ivanovna s kitchen
two samovars were boiling that tea and punch might be offered after dinner
katerina ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions with the help of one of the lodgers an unfortunate little pole who had somehow been stranded at madame lippevechsel s
he promptly put himself at katerina ivanovna s disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before running about as fast as his legs could carry him and very anxious that everyone should be aware of it
for every trifle he ran to katerina ivanovna even hunting her out at the bazaar at every instant called her
she was heartily sick of him before the end though she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this serviceable and magnanimous man
it was one of katerina ivanovna s characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours
her praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing she would invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance and quite genuinely believe in their reality
then all of a sudden she would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring
she was naturally of a gay lively and disposition but from continual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so that all should live in peace and joy and should not to break the peace that the slightest jar the smallest disaster reduced her almost to frenzy and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and fancies to cursing her fate and raving and knocking her head against the wall
amalia ivanovna too suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in katerina ivanovna s eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary respect probably only because amalia ivanovna had thrown herself heart and soul into the preparations
she had undertaken to lay the table to provide the linen crockery and to cook the dishes in her kitchen and katerina ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone herself to the cemetery
even the was nearly clean the crockery knives forks and glasses were of course of all shapes and patterns lent by different lodgers but the table was properly laid at the time fixed and amalia ivanovna feeling she had done her work well had put on a black silk dress and a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some pride
this pride though justifiable displeased katerina ivanovna for some reason as though the table could not have been laid except by amalia ivanovna
she disliked the cap with new ribbons too
could she be stuck up the stupid german because she was mistress of the house and had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers
katerina ivanovna s father who had been a colonel and almost a governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons and then anyone like amalia ivanovna or rather ludwigovna would not have been allowed into the kitchen
katerina ivanovna however put off expressing her feelings for the time and contented herself with treating her coldly though she decided inwardly that she would certainly have to put amalia ivanovna down and set her in her proper place for goodness only knew what she was fancying herself
katerina ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral except the pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery while to the memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned up the wretched creatures many of them not quite sober
the older and more respectable of them all as if by common consent stayed away
pyotr petrovitch luzhin for instance who might be said to be the most respectable of all the lodgers did not appear though katerina ivanovna had the evening before told all the world that is amalia ivanovna polenka sonia and the pole that he was the most generous man with a large property and vast connections who had been a friend of her first husband s and a guest in her father s house and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her a considerable pension
it must be noted that when katerina ivanovna exalted anyone s connections and fortune it was without any ulterior motive quite disinterestedly for the mere pleasure of adding to the consequence of the person praised
probably taking his cue from luzhin that contemptible wretch lebeziatnikov had not turned up either
he was only asked out of kindness and because he was sharing the same room with pyotr petrovitch and was a friend of his so that it would have been awkward not to invite him
among those who failed to appear were the genteel lady and her daughter who had only been lodgers in the house for the last fortnight but had several times complained of the noise and uproar in katerina ivanovna s room especially when marmeladov had come back drunk
katerina ivanovna heard this from amalia ivanovna who quarrelling with katerina ivanovna and threatening to turn the whole family out of doors had shouted at her that they were not worth the foot of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing
katerina ivanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter whose foot she was not worth and who had turned away haughtily when she casually met them so that they might know that she was more noble in her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice and might see that she was not accustomed to her way of living
she had proposed to make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father s governorship and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly stupid of them to turn away on meeting her
the fat he was really a discharged officer of low rank was also absent but it appeared that he had been not himself for the last two days
the party consisted of the pole a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat who had not a word to say for himself and smelt abominably a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the post office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone at amalia ivanovna s
a retired clerk of the commissariat department came too he was drunk had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy was without a waistcoat
one of the visitors sat straight down to the table without even greeting katerina ivanovna
finally one person having no suit appeared in his but this was too much and the efforts of amalia ivanovna and the pole succeeded in removing him
the pole brought with him however two other poles who did not live at amalia ivanovna s and whom no one had seen here before
all this irritated katerina ivanovna intensely
for whom had they made all these preparations then
to make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid for at the table but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box while polenka as a big girl had to look after them feed them and keep their noses wiped like children s
katerina ivanovna in fact could hardly help meeting her guests with increased dignity and even haughtiness
she stared at some of them with special severity and loftily invited them to take their seats
rushing to the conclusion that amalia ivanovna must be responsible for those who were absent she began treating her with extreme nonchalance which the latter promptly observed and resented
such a beginning was no good omen for the end
raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the cemetery
katerina ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him in the first place because he was the one educated visitor and as everyone knew was in two years to take a professorship in the university and secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having been unable to be at the funeral
she positively pounced upon him and made him sit on her left hand amalia ivanovna was on her right
in spite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round correctly and that everyone should taste them in spite of the agonising cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse during the last few days she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to raskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at the failure of the dinner interspersing her remarks with lively and uncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of her landlady
katerina ivanovna nodded towards the landlady
look at her she s making round eyes she feels that we are talking about her and can t understand
and what does she put on that cap for
have you noticed that she wants everyone to consider that she is patronising me and doing me an honour by being here
i asked her like a sensible woman to invite people especially those who knew my late husband and look at the set of fools she has brought
look at that one with the spotty face
not one of them has ever poked his nose in here i ve never set eyes on them
what have they come here for i ask you
she cried suddenly to one of them have you tasted the pancakes
look he s jumped up and is making his bows they must be quite starved poor things
they don t make a noise anyway though i m really afraid for our landlady s silver spoons
she addressed her suddenly almost aloud if your spoons should happen to be stolen i won t be responsible i warn you
she laughed turning to raskolnikov and again nodding towards the landlady in high glee at her sally
she didn t understand she didn t understand again
look how she sits with her mouth open
here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that lasted five minutes
drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead and her handkerchief was stained with blood
she showed raskolnikov the blood in silence and as soon as she could get her breath began whispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her cheeks
do you know i gave her the most delicate instructions so to speak for inviting that lady and her daughter you understand of whom i am speaking
it needed the utmost delicacy the greatest nicety but she has managed things so that that fool that conceited baggage that provincial nonentity simply because she is the widow of a major and has come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the government offices because at fifty she paints her face everybody knows it
a creature like that did not think fit to come and has not even answered the invitation which the most ordinary good manners required
i can t understand why pyotr petrovitch has not come
what is it sonia where have you been
it s odd that even at your father s funeral you should be so unpunctual
rodion romanovitch make room for her beside you
that s your place sonia take what you like
have some of the cold entr√©e with jelly that s the best
they ll bring the pancakes directly
have they given the children some
polenka have you got everything
be a good girl lida and kolya don t fidget with your feet sit like a little gentleman
sonia hastened to give her pyotr petrovitch s apologies trying to speak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most respectful phrases which she attributed to pyotr petrovitch
she added that pyotr petrovitch had particularly told her to say that as soon as he possibly could he would come immediately to discuss alone with her and to consider what could be done for her etc sonia knew that this would comfort katerina ivanovna would flatter her and gratify her pride
she sat down beside raskolnikov she made him a hurried bow glancing curiously at him
but for the rest of the time she seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him
she seemed though she kept looking at katerina ivanovna trying to please her
neither she nor katerina ivanovna had been able to get mourning sonia was wearing dark brown and katerina ivanovna had on her only dress a dark striped cotton one
the message from pyotr petrovitch was very successful
listening to sonia with dignity katerina ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how pyotr petrovitch was then at once whispered almost aloud to raskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of pyotr petrovitch s position and standing to find himself in such extraordinary company in spite of his devotion to her family and his old friendship with her father
that s why i am so grateful to you rodion romanovitch that you have not disdained my hospitality even in such surroundings she added almost aloud
but i am sure that it was only your special affection for my poor husband that has made you keep your promise
then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors and suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man wouldn t he have some more meat and had he been given some wine
the old man made no answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked though his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him
he simply gazed about him with his mouth open which only increased the general mirth
but as to pyotr petrovitch i always had confidence in him katerina ivanovna continued and of course he is not like with an extremely stern face she addressed amalia ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter was quite disconcerted not like your dressed up draggletails whom my father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen and my late husband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the goodness of his heart
yes he was fond of drink he was fond of it he did drink
cried the commissariat clerk gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka
my late husband certainly had that weakness and everyone knows it katerina ivanovna attacked him at once but he was a kind and honourable man who loved and respected his family
the worst of it was his good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people and he drank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe
would you believe it rodion romanovitch they found a gingerbread cock in his pocket he was dead drunk but he did not forget the children
did you say a cock shouted the commissariat clerk
katerina ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply
no doubt you think like everyone that i was too severe with him she went on addressing raskolnikov
he respected me he respected me very much
and how sorry i was for him sometimes
he would sit in a corner and look at me i used to feel so sorry for him i used to want to be kind to him and then would think to myself be kind to him and he will drink again it was only by severity that you could keep him within bounds
yes he used to get his hair pulled pretty often roared the commissariat clerk again swallowing another glass of vodka
some fools would be the better for a good drubbing as well as having their hair pulled
i am not talking of my late husband now
katerina ivanovna snapped at him
the flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked her chest heaved
in another minute she would have been ready to make a scene
many of the visitors were sniggering evidently delighted
they began poking the commissariat clerk and whispering something to him
they were evidently trying to egg him on
allow me to ask what are you alluding to began the clerk that is to say whose about whom did you say just now
and he took another drink of vodka
raskolnikov sat in silence listening with disgust
he only ate from politeness just tasting the food that katerina ivanovna was continually putting on his plate to avoid hurting her feelings
but sonia became more and more anxious and distressed she too foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably and saw with terror katerina ivanovna s growing irritation
she knew that she sonia was the chief reason for the genteel ladies contemptuous treatment of katerina ivanovna s invitation
she had heard from amalia ivanovna that the mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the question how could she let her daughter sit down beside young
sonia had a feeling that katerina ivanovna had already heard this and an insult to sonia meant more to katerina ivanovna than an insult to herself her children or her father sonia knew that katerina ivanovna would not be satisfied now till she had shown those draggletails that they were both
to make matters worse someone passed sonia from the other end of the table a plate with two hearts pierced with an arrow cut out of black bread
katerina ivanovna flushed crimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it was a drunken ass
amalia ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss and at the same time deeply wounded by katerina ivanovna s haughtiness and to restore the of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began apropos of nothing telling a story about an acquaintance of hers karl from the chemist s who was driving one night in a cab and that the cabman wanted him to kill and karl very much begged him not to kill and wept and clasped hands and frightened and from fear pierced his heart
though katerina ivanovna smiled she observed at once that amalia ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in russian the latter was still more offended and she retorted that her aus was a very important man and always went with his hands in pockets
katerina ivanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that amalia ivanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself
katerina ivanovna whispered at once her almost restored she meant to say he kept his hands in his pockets but she said he put his hands in people s pockets
and have you noticed rodion romanovitch that all these petersburg foreigners the germans especially are all stupider than we
can you fancy anyone of us telling how karl from the chemist s pierced his heart from fear and that the idiot instead of punishing the cabman clasped his hands and wept and much begged
and you know she fancies it s very touching and does not suspect how stupid she is
to my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great deal cleverer anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with drink but you know these foreigners are always so well behaved and serious
regaining her katerina ivanovna began at once telling raskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension she intended to open a school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town t
this was the first time she had spoken to him of the project and she launched out into the most alluring details
it suddenly appeared that katerina ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of which marmeladov had spoken to raskolnikov in the tavern when he told him that katerina ivanovna his wife had danced the shawl dance before the governor and other great personages on leaving school
this certificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove katerina ivanovna s right to open a but she had armed herself with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming those two draggletails if they came to the dinner and proving incontestably that katerina ivanovna was of the most noble she might even say aristocratic family a colonel s daughter and was far superior to certain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late
the certificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken guests and katerina ivanovna did not try to retain it for it actually contained the statement toutes that her father was of the rank of a major and also a companion of an order so that she really was almost the daughter of a colonel
warming up katerina ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and happy life they would lead in t on the gymnasium teachers whom she would engage to give lessons in her one a most respectable old frenchman one mangot who had taught katerina ivanovna herself in old days and was still living in t and would no doubt teach in her school on moderate terms
next she spoke of sonia who would go with her to t and help her in all her plans
at this someone at the further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw
though katerina ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of it she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of sonia s undoubted ability to assist her of her gentleness patience devotion generosity and good education tapping sonia on the cheek and kissing her warmly twice
sonia flushed crimson and katerina ivanovna suddenly burst into tears immediately observing that she was nervous and silly that she was too much upset that it was time to finish and as the dinner was over it was time to hand round the tea
at that moment amalia ivanovna deeply aggrieved at taking no part in the conversation and not being listened to made one last effort and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty observation that in the future she would have to pay particular attention to and that there certainly must be a good to look after the linen and secondly that the young ladies must not novels at night katerina ivanovna who certainly was upset and very tired as well as heartily sick of the dinner at once cut short amalia ivanovna saying she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense that it was the business of the laundry maid and not of the directress of a to look after and as for that was simply rudeness and she begged her to be silent
amalia ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only meant her good and that she had meant her very good and that it was long since she had paid her for the lodgings
katerina ivanovna at once set her down saying that it was a lie to say she wished her good because only yesterday when her dead husband was lying on the table she had worried her about the lodgings
to this amalia ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those ladies but those ladies had not come because those ladies ladies and can not come to a lady who is not a lady
katerina ivanovna at once pointed out to her that as she was a slut she could not judge what made one really a lady
amalia ivanovna at once declared that her aus was a very very important man and both hands in pockets went and always used to say poof poof
and she leapt up from the table to represent her father sticking her hands in her pockets puffing her cheeks and uttering vague sounds resembling poof poof
amid loud laughter from all the lodgers who purposely encouraged amalia ivanovna hoping for a fight
but this was too much for katerina ivanovna and she at once declared so that all could hear that amalia ivanovna probably never had a father but was simply a drunken petersburg finn and had certainly once been a cook and probably something worse
amalia ivanovna turned as red as a lobster and squealed that perhaps katerina ivanovna never had a father but she had a aus and that he wore a long coat and always said
katerina ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family was and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print that her father was a colonel while amalia ivanovna s father if she really had one was probably some finnish milkman but that probably she never had a father at all since it was still uncertain whether her name was amalia ivanovna or amalia ludwigovna
at this amalia ivanovna lashed to fury struck the table with her fist and shrieked that she was amalia ivanovna and not ludwigovna that her was named johann and that he was a burgomeister and that katerina ivanovna s was quite never a burgomeister
katerina ivanovna rose from her chair and with a stern and apparently calm voice though she was pale and her chest was heaving observed that if she dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a level with her papa she katerina ivanovna would tear her cap off her head and trample it under foot
amalia ivanovna ran about the room shouting at the top of her voice that she was mistress of the house and that katerina ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute then she rushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table
there was a great outcry and uproar the children began crying
sonia ran to restrain katerina ivanovna but when amalia ivanovna shouted something about the yellow ticket katerina ivanovna pushed sonia away and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat
at that minute the door opened and pyotr petrovitch luzhin appeared on the threshold
he stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant eyes
katerina ivanovna rushed to him
she cried protect me you at least
make this foolish woman understand that she can t behave like this to a lady in misfortune that there is a law for such things
remembering my father s hospitality protect these orphans
your papa as you are well aware i had not the honour of knowing someone laughed aloud
and i do not intend to take part in your everlasting squabbles with amalia ivanovna
i have come here to speak of my own affairs and i want to have a word with your stepdaughter sofya
pyotr petrovitch edging by her went to the opposite corner where sonia was
katerina ivanovna remained standing where she was as though thunderstruck
she could not understand how pyotr petrovitch could deny having enjoyed her father s hospitality
though she had invented it herself she believed in it firmly by this time
she was struck too by the businesslike dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of pyotr petrovitch
all the clamour gradually died away at his entrance
not only was this serious business man strikingly incongruous with the rest of the party but it was evident too that he had come upon some matter of consequence that some exceptional cause must have brought him and that therefore something was going to happen
raskolnikov standing beside sonia moved aside to let him pass pyotr petrovitch did not seem to notice him
a minute later lebeziatnikov too appeared in the doorway he did not come in but stood still listening with marked interest almost wonder and seemed for a time perplexed
excuse me for possibly interrupting you but it s a matter of some importance pyotr petrovitch observed addressing the company generally
i am glad indeed to find other persons present
amalia ivanovna i humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful attention to what i have to say to sofya ivanovna
sofya ivanovna he went on addressing sonia who was very much surprised and already alarmed immediately after your visit i found that a note was missing from my table in the room of my friend lebeziatnikov
if in any way whatever you know and will tell us where it is now i assure you on my word of honour and call all present to witness that the matter shall end there
in the opposite case i shall be compelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then
complete silence reigned in the room
even the crying children were still
sonia stood deadly pale staring at luzhin and unable to say a word
well how is it to be then asked luzhin looking intently at her
i know nothing about it sonia articulated faintly at last
luzhin repeated and again he paused for some seconds
think a moment mademoiselle he began severely but still as it were admonishing her
reflect i am prepared to give you time for consideration
kindly observe this if i were not so entirely convinced i should not you may be sure with my experience venture to accuse you so directly
seeing that for such direct accusation before witnesses if false or even mistaken i should myself in a certain sense be made responsible i am aware of that
this morning i changed for my own purposes several securities for the sum of approximately three thousand roubles
the account is noted down in my
on my return home i proceeded to count the money as lebeziatnikov will bear witness and after counting two thousand three hundred roubles i put the rest in my in my coat pocket
about five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them three notes of a hundred roubles each
at that moment you entered at my invitation and all the time you were present you were exceedingly embarrassed so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the conversation and tried to make off
lebeziatnikov can bear witness to this
you yourself mademoiselle probably will not refuse to confirm my statement that i invited you through lebeziatnikov solely in order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your relative katerina ivanovna whose dinner i was unable to attend and the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a subscription lottery or the like for her benefit
you thanked me and even shed tears
i describe all this as it took place primarily to recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest detail has escaped my recollection
then i took a note from the table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part for the benefit of your relative
then i accompanied you to the door you being still in the same state of embarrassment after which being left alone with lebeziatnikov i talked to him for ten minutes then lebeziatnikov went out
and i returned to the table with the money lying on it intending to count it and to put it aside as i proposed doing before
to my surprise one note had disappeared
lebeziatnikov i can not suspect
i am ashamed to allude to such a supposition
i can not have made a mistake in my reckoning for the minute before your entrance i had finished my accounts and found the total correct
you will admit that recollecting your embarrassment your eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some time on the table and taking into consideration your social position and the habits associated with it i was so to say with horror and positively against my will to entertain a suspicion a cruel but justifiable suspicion
i will add further and repeat that in spite of my positive conviction i realise that i run a certain risk in making this accusation but as you see i could not let it pass
i have taken action and i will tell you why solely madam solely owing to your black ingratitude
i invite you for the benefit of your destitute relative i present you with my donation of ten roubles and you on the spot repay me for all that with such an action
moreover like a true friend i beg you and you could have no better friend at this moment think what you are doing otherwise i shall be immovable
i have taken nothing sonia whispered in terror you gave me ten roubles here it is take it
sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket untied a corner of it took out the note and gave it to luzhin
and the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking he insisted reproachfully not taking the note
all were looking at her with such awful stern ironical hostile eyes
she looked at raskolnikov he stood against the wall with his arms crossed looking at her with glowing eyes
amalia ivanovna we shall have to send word to the police and therefore i humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter luzhin said softly and even kindly
i knew she was the thief cried amalia ivanovna throwing up her hands
luzhin caught her up then i suppose you had some reason before this for thinking so
i beg you worthy amalia ivanovna to remember your words which have been uttered before witnesses
there was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides
what cried katerina ivanovna suddenly realising the position and she rushed at luzhin
and running to sonia she flung her wasted arms round her and held her as in a vise
how dared you take ten roubles from him
give me the ten roubles at once here
and snatching the note from sonia katerina ivanovna crumpled it up and flung it straight into luzhin s face
it hit him in the eye and fell on the ground
amalia ivanovna hastened to pick it up
pyotr petrovitch lost his temper
at that moment several other persons besides lebeziatnikov appeared in the doorway among them the two ladies
idiot shrieked katerina ivanovna
you are an idiot yourself pettifogging lawyer base man
why she d give away her last penny
and katerina ivanovna broke into hysterical laughter
she suddenly saw the landlady and you too sausage eater you declare that she is a thief you trashy prussian hen s leg in a crinoline
she hasn t been out of this room she came straight from you you wretch and sat down beside me everyone saw her
she sat here by rodion romanovitch
since she s not left the room the money would have to be on her
but if you don t find it then excuse me my dear fellow you ll answer for it
i ll go to our sovereign to our sovereign to our gracious tsar himself and throw myself at his feet this minute
but i am not so submissive let me tell you
and katerina ivanovna in a frenzy shook luzhin and dragged him towards sonia
i am ready i ll be responsible but calm yourself madam calm yourself
i see that you are not so submissive
luzhin muttered that ought to be before the police though indeed there are witnesses enough as it is
but in any case it s difficult for a man on account of her sex
but with the help of amalia ivanovna though of course it s not the way to do things
let anyone who likes search her
look monster the pocket is empty here was her handkerchief
and katerina ivanovna turned or rather snatched both pockets inside out
but from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing a parabola in the air fell at luzhin s feet
everyone saw it several cried out
pyotr petrovitch stooped down picked up the paper in two fingers lifted it where all could see it and opened it
pyotr petrovitch held up the note showing it to everyone
exclamations arose on all sides
raskolnikov was silent keeping his eyes fixed on sonia except for an occasional rapid glance at luzhin
sonia stood still as though unconscious
she was hardly able to feel surprise
suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks she uttered a cry and hid her face in her hands
i know nothing about it she cried with a heartrending wail and she ran to katerina ivanovna who clasped her tightly in her arms as though she would shelter her from all the world
she cried in the face of the obvious fact swaying her to and fro in her arms like a baby kissing her face continually then snatching at her hands and kissing them too you took it
you are fools fools she cried addressing the whole room you don t know you don t know what a heart she has what a girl she is
she d sell her last rag she d go barefoot to help you if you needed it that s what she is
she has the yellow passport because my children were starving she sold herself for us
defend her why are you all standing still
rodion romanovitch why don t you stand up for her
you are not worth her little finger all of you together
the wail of the poor consumptive helpless woman seemed to produce a great effect on her audience
the agonised wasted consumptive face the parched lips the hoarse voice the tears unrestrained as a child s the trustful childish and yet despairing prayer for help were so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her
pyotr petrovitch at any rate was at once moved to
madam madam this incident does not reflect upon you
he cried impressively no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an instigator or even an accomplice in it especially as you have proved her guilt by turning out her pockets showing that you had no previous idea of it
i am most ready most ready to show compassion if poverty so to speak drove sofya semyonovna to it but why did you refuse to confess mademoiselle
were you afraid of the disgrace
but how could you have lowered yourself to such an action
gentlemen he addressed the whole company gentlemen
compassionate and so to say commiserating these people i am ready to overlook it even now in spite of the personal insult lavished upon me
and may this disgrace be a lesson to you for the future he said addressing sonia and i will carry the matter no further
pyotr petrovitch stole a glance at raskolnikov
their eyes met and the fire in raskolnikov s seemed ready to reduce him to ashes
meanwhile katerina ivanovna apparently heard nothing
she was kissing and hugging sonia like a madwoman
the children too were embracing sonia on all sides and polenka though she did not fully understand what was wrong was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs as she hid her pretty little face swollen with weeping on sonia s shoulder
a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway
pyotr petrovitch looked round quickly
lebeziatnikov repeated staring him straight in the face
pyotr petrovitch gave a positive start all noticed it and recalled it afterwards
lebeziatnikov strode into the room
and you dared to call me as witness he said going up to pyotr petrovitch
i mean that you are a slanderer that s what my words mean
lebeziatnikov said hotly looking sternly at him with his eyes
raskolnikov gazed intently at him as though seizing and weighing each word
pyotr petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment
if you mean that for me he began stammering
i m in my mind but you are a scoundrel
i kept waiting on purpose to understand it for i must own even now it is not quite logical
what you have done it all for i can t understand
give over talking in your nonsensical riddles
you may be a drunkard perhaps vile man but i am not
i never touch vodka for it s against my convictions
would you believe it he he himself with his own hands gave sofya semyonovna that note i saw it i was a witness i ll take my oath
repeated lebeziatnikov addressing all
are you crazy milksop squealed luzhin
she is herself before you she herself here declared just now before everyone that i gave her only ten roubles
how could i have given it to her
i saw it i saw it lebeziatnikov repeated and though it is against my principles i am ready this very minute to take any oath you like before the court for i saw how you slipped it in her pocket
only like a fool i thought you did it out of kindness
when you were saying to her at the door while you held her hand in one hand with the other the left you slipped the note into her pocket
he cried impudently why how could you standing by the window see the note
and though i was standing some way off i saw it all
and though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from the window that s true i knew for certain that it was a note because when you were going to give sofya semyonovna ten roubles you took up from the table a note i saw it because i was standing near then and an idea struck me at once so that i did not forget you had it in your hand
you folded it and kept it in your hand all the time
i didn t think of it again until when you were getting up you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped it
i noticed it because the same idea struck me again that you meant to do her a kindness without my seeing
you can fancy how i watched you and i saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket
i saw it i saw it i ll take my oath
lebeziatnikov was almost breathless
exclamations arose on all hands chiefly expressive of wonder but some were menacing in tone
they all crowded round pyotr petrovitch
katerina ivanovna flew to lebeziatnikov
you are the only one to take her part
katerina ivanovna hardly knowing what she was doing sank on her knees before him
yelled luzhin roused to fury it s all nonsense you ve been talking
an idea struck you you didn t think you noticed what does it amount to
so i gave it to her on the sly on purpose
that s what i can t understand but that what i am telling you is the fact that s certain
so far from my being mistaken you infamous criminal man i remember how on account of it a question occurred to me at once just when i was thanking you and pressing your hand
what made you put it secretly in her pocket
could it be simply to conceal it from me knowing that my convictions are opposed to yours and that i do not approve of private benevolence which effects no radical cure
well i decided that you really were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me
perhaps too i thought he wants to give her a surprise when she finds a whole note in her pocket
for i know some benevolent people are very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way
then the idea struck me too that you wanted to test her to see whether when she found it she would come to thank you
then too that you wanted to avoid thanks and that as the saying is your right hand should not know something of that sort in fact
i thought of so many possibilities that i put off considering it but still thought it indelicate to show you that i knew your secret
but another idea struck me again that sofya semyonovna might easily lose the money before she noticed it that was why i decided to come in here to call her out of the room and to tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket
but on my way i went first to madame kobilatnikov s to take them the general treatise on the positive method and especially to recommend piderit s article and also wagner s then i come on here and what a state of things i find
now could i could i have all these ideas and reflections if i had not seen you put the note in her pocket
when lebeziatnikov finished his harangue with the logical deduction at the end he was quite tired and the perspiration streamed from his face
he could not alas even express himself correctly in russian though he knew no other language so that he was quite exhausted almost emaciated after this heroic exploit
but his speech produced a powerful effect
he had spoken with such vehemence with such conviction that everyone obviously believed him
pyotr petrovitch felt that things were going badly with him
what is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you
you may have dreamt it that s all
and i tell you you are lying sir
you are lying and slandering from some spite against me simply from pique because i did not agree with your godless social propositions
but this retort did not benefit pyotr petrovitch
murmurs of disapproval were heard on all sides
cried lebeziatnikov that s nonsense
call the police and i ll take my oath
there s only one thing i can t understand what made him risk such a contemptible action
i can explain why he risked such an action and if necessary i too will swear to it raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice and he stepped forward
he appeared to be firm and composed
everyone felt clearly from the very look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would be solved
now i can explain it all to myself said raskolnikov addressing lebeziatnikov
from the very beginning of the business i suspected that there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it
i began to suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only which i will explain at once to everyone they account for everything
your valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me
this gentleman he pointed to luzhin was recently engaged to be married to a young lady my sister avdotya romanovna raskolnikov
but coming to petersburg he quarrelled with me the day before yesterday at our first meeting and i drove him out of my room i have two witnesses to prove it
the day before yesterday i did not know that he was staying here in your room and that consequently on the very day we quarrelled the day before yesterday he saw me give katerina ivanovna some money for the funeral as a friend of the late marmeladov
he at once wrote a note to my mother and informed her that i had given away all my money not to katerina ivanovna but to sofya semyonovna and referred in a most contemptible way to the character of sofya semyonovna that is hinted at the character of my attitude to sofya semyonovna
all this you understand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister by insinuating that i was squandering on unworthy objects the money which they had sent me and which was all they had
yesterday evening before my mother and sister and in his presence i declared that i had given the money to katerina ivanovna for the funeral and not to sofya semyonovna and that i had no acquaintance with sofya semyonovna and had never seen her before indeed
at the same time i added that he pyotr petrovitch luzhin with all his virtues was not worth sofya semyonovna s little finger though he spoke so ill of her
to his question would i let sofya semyonovna sit down beside my sister i answered that i had already done so that day
irritated that my mother and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations he gradually began being unpardonably rude to them
a final rupture took place and he was turned out of the house
all this happened yesterday evening
now i beg your special attention consider if he had now succeeded in proving that sofya semyonovna was a thief he would have shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his suspicions that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on a level with sofya semyonovna that in attacking me he was protecting and preserving the honour of my sister his betrothed
in fact he might even through all this have been able to estrange me from my family and no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them to say nothing of revenging himself on me personally for he has grounds for supposing that the honour and happiness of sofya semyonovna are very precious to me
that was what he was working for
that s the whole reason for it and there can be no other
it was like this or somewhat like this that raskolnikov wound up his speech which was followed very attentively though often interrupted by exclamations from his audience
but in spite of interruptions he spoke clearly calmly exactly firmly
his decisive voice his tone of conviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone
yes yes that s it lebeziatnikov assented gleefully that must be it for he asked me as soon as sofya semyonovna came into our room whether you were here whether i had seen you among katerina ivanovna s guests
he called me aside to the window and asked me in secret
it was essential for him that you should be here
luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak
he seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape
perhaps he would have been glad to give up everything and get away but at the moment this was scarcely possible
it would have implied admitting the truth of the accusations brought against him
moreover the company which had already been excited by drink was now too much stirred to allow it
the commissariat clerk though indeed he had not grasped the whole position was shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very unpleasant to luzhin
but not all those present were drunk lodgers came in from all the rooms
the three poles were tremendously excited and were continually shouting at him the is a
and muttering threats in polish
sonia had been listening with strained attention though she too seemed unable to grasp it all she seemed as though she had just returned to consciousness
she did not take her eyes off raskolnikov feeling that all her safety lay in him
katerina ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted
amalia ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone with her mouth wide open unable to make out what had happened
she only saw that pyotr petrovitch had somehow come to grief
raskolnikov was attempting to speak again but they did not let him
everyone was crowding round luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse
but pyotr petrovitch was not intimidated
seeing that his accusation of sonia had completely failed he had recourse to insolence allow me gentlemen allow me
he said making his way through the crowd
i assure you it will be useless you will gain nothing by it
on the contrary you ll have to answer gentlemen for violently obstructing the course of justice
the thief has been more than unmasked and i shall prosecute
our judges are not so blind and not so drunk and will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels agitators and atheists who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are foolish enough to admit
don t let me find a trace of you in my room
kindly leave at once and everything is at an end between us
when i think of the trouble i ve been taking the way i ve been expounding all this fortnight
i told you myself that i was going when you tried to keep me now i will simply add that you are a fool
i advise you to see a doctor for your brains and your short sight
but the commissariat clerk was unwilling to let him off so easily he picked up a glass from the table brandished it in the air and flung it at pyotr petrovitch but the glass flew straight at amalia ivanovna
she screamed and the clerk overbalancing fell heavily under the table
pyotr petrovitch made his way to his room and half an hour later had left the house
sonia timid by nature had felt before that day that she could be more easily than anyone and that she could be wronged with impunity
yet till that moment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care gentleness and submissiveness before everyone
her disappointment was too great
she could of course bear with patience and almost without murmur anything even this
but for the first minute she felt it too bitter
in spite of her triumph and her justification when her first terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all clearly the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her made her heart throb with anguish
and she was overcome with hysterical weeping
at last unable to bear any more she rushed out of the room and ran home almost immediately after luzhin s departure
when amidst loud laughter the glass flew at amalia ivanovna it was more than the landlady could endure
with a shriek she rushed like a fury at katerina ivanovna considering her to blame for everything
and with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay her hands on that belonged to katerina ivanovna and throwing it on the floor
katerina ivanovna pale almost fainting and gasping for breath jumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at amalia ivanovna
but the battle was too unequal the landlady waved her away like a feather
as though that godless calumny was not enough this vile creature attacks me
on the day of my husband s funeral i am turned out of my lodging
after eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street with my orphans
wailed the poor woman sobbing and gasping
she cried with flashing eyes is there no justice upon earth
whom should you protect if not us orphans
there is law and justice on earth there is i will find it
polenka stay with the children i ll come back
wait for me if you have to wait in the street
we will see whether there is justice on earth
and throwing over her head that green shawl which marmeladov had mentioned to raskolnikov katerina ivanovna squeezed her way through the disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room and wailing and tearful she ran into the street with a vague intention of going at once somewhere to find justice
polenka with the two little ones in her arms crouched terrified on the trunk in the corner of the room where she waited trembling for her mother to come back
amalia ivanovna raged about the room shrieking lamenting and throwing everything she came across on the floor
the lodgers talked incoherently some commented to the best of their ability on what had happened others quarrelled and swore at one another while others struck up a song
now it s time for me to go thought raskolnikov
well sofya semyonovna we shall see what you ll say now
and he set off in the direction of sonia s lodgings
chapter iv raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of sonia against luzhin although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own heart
but having gone through so much in the morning he found a sort of relief in a change of sensations apart from the strong personal feeling which impelled him to defend sonia
he was agitated too especially at some moments by the thought of his approaching interview with sonia he to tell her who had killed lizaveta
he knew the terrible suffering it would be to him and as it were brushed away the thought of it
so when he cried as he left katerina ivanovna s well sofya semyonovna we shall see what you ll say now
he was still superficially excited still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over luzhin
but strange to say by the time he reached sonia s lodging he felt a sudden impotence and fear
he stood still in hesitation at the door asking himself the strange question must he tell her who killed lizaveta
it was a strange question because he felt at the very time not only that he could not help telling her but also that he could not put off the telling
he did not yet know why it must be so he only it and the agonising sense of his impotence before the inevitable almost crushed him
to cut short his hesitation and suffering he quickly opened the door and looked at sonia from the doorway
she was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in her hands but seeing raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet him as though she were expecting him
what would have become of me but for you
she said quickly meeting him in the middle of the room
evidently she was in haste to say this to him
it was what she had been waiting for
raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she had only just risen
she stood facing him two steps away just as she had done the day before
he said and felt that his voice was trembling it was all due to your social position and the habits associated with it
did you understand that just now
only don t talk to me as you did yesterday she interrupted him
there is misery enough without that
she made haste to smile afraid that he might not like the reproach
i was silly to come away from there
i wanted to go back directly but i kept thinking that you would come
he told her that amalia ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging and that katerina ivanovna had run off somewhere to seek justice
my god cried sonia let s go at once
it s everlastingly the same thing said raskolnikov irritably
you ve no thought except for them
but katerina ivanovna you won t lose katerina ivanovna you may be sure she ll come to you herself since she has run out he added peevishly
if she doesn t find you here you ll be blamed for it
sonia sat down in painful suspense
raskolnikov was silent gazing at the floor and deliberating
this time luzhin did not want to prosecute you he began not looking at sonia but if he had wanted to if it had suited his plans he would have sent you to prison if it had not been for lebeziatnikov and me
ah yes she assented in a faint voice
yes she repeated preoccupied and distressed
but i might easily not have been there
and it was quite an accident lebeziatnikov s turning up
and if you d gone to prison what then
do you remember what i said yesterday
i thought you would cry out again don t speak of it leave off
raskolnikov gave a laugh but rather a forced one
we must talk about something you know
it would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a certain problem as lebeziatnikov would say
he was beginning to lose the thread
imagine sonia that you had known all luzhin s intentions beforehand
known that is for a fact that they would be the ruin of katerina ivanovna and the children and yourself thrown in since you don t count yourself for anything polenka too for she ll go the same way
well if suddenly it all depended on your decision whether he or they should go on living that is whether luzhin should go on living and doing wicked things or katerina ivanovna should die
how would you decide which of them was to die
there was something peculiar in this hesitating question which seemed approaching something in a roundabout way
i felt that you were going to ask some question like that she said looking inquisitively at him
why do you ask about what could not happen said sonia reluctantly
then it would be better for luzhin to go on living and doing wicked things
you haven t dared to decide even that
but i can t know the divine providence
and why do you ask what can t be answered
what s the use of such foolish questions
how could it happen that it should depend on my decision who has made me a judge to decide who is to live and who is not to live
oh if the divine providence is to be mixed up in it there is no doing anything raskolnikov grumbled morosely
you d better say straight out what you want
you are leading up to something again
can you have come simply to torture me
she could not control herself and began crying bitterly
he looked at her in gloomy misery
of course you re right sonia he said softly at last
his tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone
even his voice was suddenly weak
i told you yesterday that i was not coming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing i ve said is to ask forgiveness
i said that about luzhin and providence for my own sake
he tried to smile but there was something helpless and incomplete in his pale smile
he bowed his head and hid his face in his hands
and suddenly a strange surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred for sonia passed through his heart
as it were wondering and frightened of this sensation he raised his head and looked intently at her but he met her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him there was love in them his hatred vanished like a phantom
it was not the real feeling he had taken the one feeling for the other
it only meant that minute had come
he hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head
suddenly he turned pale got up from his chair looked at sonia and without uttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed
his sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he had stood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and felt that he must not lose another minute
what s the matter asked sonia dreadfully frightened
this was not at all not at all the way he had intended to tell and he did not understand what was happening to him now
she went up to him softly sat down on the bed beside him and waited not taking her eyes off him
it was unendurable he turned his deadly pale face to her
his lips worked helplessly struggling to utter something
a pang of terror passed through sonia s heart
what s the matter she repeated drawing a little away from him
nothing sonia don t be frightened
it really is nonsense if you think of it he muttered like a man in delirium
he added suddenly looking at her
i keep asking myself that question sonia
he had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour before but now he spoke helplessly hardly knowing what he said and feeling a continual tremor all over
she muttered in distress looking intently at him
he suddenly smiled a pale helpless smile for two seconds
you remember what i meant to tell you yesterday
i said as i went away that perhaps i was saying for ever but that if i came i would tell you who who killed lizaveta
well here i ve come to tell you
then you really meant it yesterday
she asked quickly as though suddenly regaining her reason
sonia s face grew paler and paler and she breathed painfully
she asked again hardly audibly and again after a minute s pause
he turned to her and looked very intently at her
guess he said with the same distorted helpless smile
but you why do you frighten me like this
i must be a great friend of since i know raskolnikov went on still gazing into her face as though he could not turn his eyes away
he did not mean to kill that lizaveta he killed her accidentally
he meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and he went there and then lizaveta came in he killed her too
both still gazed at one another
he asked suddenly feeling as though he were flinging himself down from a steeple
as soon as he had said this again the same familiar sensation froze his heart
he looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the face of lizaveta
he remembered clearly the expression in lizaveta s face when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the wall putting out her hand with childish terror in her face looking as little children do when they begin to be frightened of something looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them shrinking back and holding out their little hands on the point of crying
almost the same thing happened now to sonia
with the same helplessness and the same terror she looked at him for a while and suddenly putting out her left hand pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to get up from the bed moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed even more immovably on him
the same fear showed itself on his face
in the same way he stared at her and almost with the same smile
good god broke in an awful wail from her bosom
she sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows but a moment later she got up moved quickly to him seized both his hands and gripping them tight in her thin fingers began looking into his face again with the same intent stare
in this last desperate look she tried to look into him and catch some last hope
but there was no hope there was no doubt remaining it was all true
later on indeed when she recalled that moment she thought it strange and wondered why she had seen at once that there was no doubt
she could not have said for instance that she had foreseen something of the sort and yet now as soon as he told her she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen this very thing
don t torture me he begged her miserably
it was not at all not at all like this he had thought of telling her but this is how it happened
she jumped up seeming not to know what she was doing and wringing her hands walked into the middle of the room but quickly went back and sat down again beside him her shoulder almost touching his
all of a sudden she started as though she had been stabbed uttered a cry and fell on her knees before him she did not know why
what have you done what have you done to yourself
she said in despair and jumping up she flung herself on his neck threw her arms round him and held him tightly
raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile
you are a strange girl sonia you kiss me and hug me when i tell you about that
you don t think what you are doing
there is no one no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you
she cried in a frenzy not hearing what he said and she suddenly broke into violent hysterical weeping
a feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at once
two tears started into his eyes and hung on his eyelashes
he said looking at her almost with hope
no no never nowhere cried sonia
i will follow you i will follow you everywhere
she repeated as it were unconsciously and she hugged him again
he recoiled at this and the same hostile almost haughty smile came to his lips
perhaps i don t want to go to siberia yet sonia he said
again after her first passionate agonising sympathy for the unhappy man the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her
in his changed tone she seemed to hear the murderer speaking
she knew nothing as yet why how with what object it had been
now all these questions rushed at once into her mind
and again she could not believe it he he is a murderer
she said in complete bewilderment as though still unable to recover herself
how could you you a man like you
how could you bring yourself to it
leave off sonia he answered wearily almost with vexation
sonia stood as though struck dumb but suddenly she cried
yes no sonia no he muttered turning away and hanging his head
i certainly did want to help my mother but that s not the real thing either
and how could you give away your last farthing and yet rob and murder
ah she cried suddenly that money you gave katerina ivanovna that money
can that money no sonia he broke in hurriedly that money was not it
that money my mother sent me and it came when i was ill the day i gave it to you
sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend
i don t even know really whether there was any money he added softly as though reflecting
i took a purse off her neck made of chamois leather a purse stuffed full of something
but i didn t look in it i suppose i hadn t time
and the things chains and trinkets i buried under a stone with the purse next morning in a yard off the v prospect
sonia strained every nerve to listen
then why why you said you did it to rob but you took nothing
she asked quickly catching at a straw
i haven t yet decided whether to take that money or not he said musing again and seeming to wake up with a start he gave a brief ironical smile
ach what silly stuff i am talking eh
the thought flashed through sonia s mind wasn t he mad
she could make nothing of it nothing
do you know sonia he said suddenly with conviction let me tell you if i d simply killed because i was hungry laying stress on every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her i should be now
what would it matter to you he cried a moment later with a sort of despair what would it matter to you if i were to confess that i did wrong
what do you gain by such a stupid triumph over me
ah sonia was it for that i ve come to you
again sonia tried to say something but did not speak
i asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all i have left
not to steal and not to murder don t be anxious he smiled bitterly
and you know sonia it s only now only this moment that i understand
i asked you to go with me yesterday
yesterday when i said it i did not know where
i asked you for one thing i came to you for one thing not to leave me
he cried a minute later in despair looking with infinite anguish at her
here you expect an explanation from me sonia you are sitting and waiting for it i see that
you won t understand and will only suffer misery on my account
well you are crying and embracing me again
because i couldn t bear my burden and have come to throw it on another you suffer too and i shall feel better
and can you love such a mean wretch
but aren t you suffering too cried sonia
again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart and again for an instant softened it
sonia i have a bad heart take note of that
there are men who wouldn t have come
but i am a coward and a mean wretch
i must speak now but i don t know how to begin
he paused and sank into thought
ach we are so different he cried again we are not alike
i shall never forgive myself that
no no it was a good thing you came cried sonia
it s better i should know far better
he said as though reaching a conclusion
i wanted to become a napoleon that is why i killed her
sonia whispered na√Øvely and timidly
only speak speak i shall understand i shall understand
he paused and was for some time lost in meditation
it was like this i asked myself one day this question what if napoleon for instance had happened to be in my place and if he had not had toulon nor egypt nor the passage of mont blanc to begin his career with but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things there had simply been some ridiculous old hag a pawnbroker who had to be murdered too to get money from her trunk for his career you understand
well would he have brought himself to that if there had been no other means
wouldn t he have felt a pang at its being so far from monumental and and sinful too
well i must tell you that i worried myself fearfully over that question so that i was awfully ashamed when i guessed at last all of a sudden somehow that it would not have given him the least pang that it would not even have struck him that it was not monumental that he would not have seen that there was anything in it to pause over and that if he had had no other way he would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it
well i too left off thinking about it murdered her following his example
yes sonia the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that s just how it was
sonia did not think it at all funny
you had better tell me straight out without examples she begged still more timidly and scarcely audibly
he turned to her looked sadly at her and took her hands
of course that s all nonsense it s almost all talk
you see you know of course that my mother has scarcely anything my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned to drudge as a governess
all their hopes were centered on me
i was a student but i couldn t keep myself at the university and was forced for a time to leave it
even if i had lingered on like that in ten or twelve years i might with luck hope to be some sort of teacher or clerk with a salary of a thousand roubles he repeated it as though it were a lesson and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief and anxiety and i could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my sister
well my sister might well have fared worse
and it s a hard thing to pass everything by all one s life to turn one s back upon everything to forget one s mother and decorously accept the insults inflicted on one s sister
when one has buried them to burden oneself with others wife and children and to leave them again without a farthing
so i resolved to gain possession of the old woman s money and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving it and to do this all on a broad thorough scale so as to build up a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence
well of course in killing the old woman i did wrong
he struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his head sink
oh that s not it that s not it sonia cried in distress
how could one no that s not right not right
you see yourself that it s not right
but i ve spoken truly it s the truth
as though that could be the truth
i ve only killed a louse sonia a useless loathsome harmful creature
i too know it wasn t a louse he answered looking strangely at her
but i am talking nonsense sonia he added
i ve been talking nonsense a long time
that s not it you are right there
there were quite quite other causes for it
i haven t talked to anyone for so long sonia
his eyes shone with feverish brilliance
he was almost delirious an uneasy smile strayed on his lips
his terrible exhaustion could be seen through his excitement
and he talked so strangely it seemed somehow comprehensible but yet
and she wrung her hands in despair
no sonia that s not it he began again suddenly raising his head as though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were roused him that s not it
better imagine yes it s certainly better imagine that i am vain envious malicious base vindictive and
well perhaps with a tendency to insanity
they ve talked of madness already i noticed
i told you just now i could not keep myself at the university
but do you know that perhaps i might have done
my mother would have sent me what i needed for the fees and i could have earned enough for clothes boots and food no doubt
lessons had turned up at half a rouble
but i turned sulky and wouldn t
yes sulkiness that s the right word for it
you ve been in my den you ve seen it
and do you know sonia that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp the soul and the mind
and yet i wouldn t go out of it
i didn t go out for days together and i wouldn t work i wouldn t even eat i just lay there doing nothing
if nastasya brought me anything i ate it if she didn t i went all day without i wouldn t ask on purpose from sulkiness
at night i had no light i lay in the dark and i wouldn t earn money for candles
i preferred lying still and thinking
and i had dreams all the time strange dreams of all sorts no need to describe
only then i began to fancy that
you see i kept asking myself then why am i so stupid that if others are stupid and i know they are yet i won t be wiser
then i saw sonia that if one waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long
afterwards i understood that that would never come to pass that men won t change and that nobody can alter it and that it s not worth wasting effort over it
that s the law of their nature sonia that s so
and i know now sonia that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will have power over them
anyone who is greatly daring is right in their eyes
he who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he who dares most of all will be most in the right
a man must be blind not to see it
though raskolnikov looked at sonia as he said this he no longer cared whether she understood or not
the fever had complete hold of him he was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy he certainly had been too long without talking to anyone
sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his faith and code
i divined then sonia he went on eagerly that power is only vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up
there is only one thing one thing needful one has only to dare
then for the first time in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever thought of before me no one
i saw clear as daylight how strange it is that not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to go straight for it all and send it flying to the devil
i only wanted to have the daring sonia
oh hush hush cried sonia clasping her hands
you turned away from god and god has smitten you has given you over to the devil
then sonia when i used to lie there in the dark and all this became clear to me was it a temptation of the devil eh hush don t laugh blasphemer
you don t understand you don t understand
i know myself that it was the devil leading me
he repeated with gloomy insistence
i know it all i have thought it all over and over and whispered it all over to myself lying there in the dark
i ve argued it all over with myself every point of it and i know it all all
and how sick how sick i was then of going over it all
i have kept wanting to forget it and make a new beginning sonia and leave off thinking
and you don t suppose that i went into it headlong like a fool
i went into it like a wise man and that was just my destruction
and you mustn t suppose that i didn t know for instance that if i began to question myself whether i had the right to gain power i certainly hadn t the right or that if i asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn t so for me though it might be for a man who would go straight to his goal without asking questions
if i worried myself all those days wondering whether napoleon would have done it or not i felt clearly of course that i wasn t napoleon
i had to endure all the agony of that battle of ideas sonia and i longed to throw it off i wanted to murder without casuistry to murder for my own sake for myself alone
i didn t want to lie about it even to myself
it wasn t to help my mother i did the murder that s nonsense i didn t do the murder to gain wealth and power and to become a benefactor of mankind
i simply did it i did the murder for myself for myself alone and whether i became a benefactor to others or spent my life like a spider catching men in my web and sucking the life out of men i couldn t have cared at that moment
and it was not the money i wanted sonia when i did it
it was not so much the money i wanted but something else
perhaps i should never have committed a murder again
i wanted to find out something else it was something else led me on
i wanted to find out then and quickly whether i was a louse like everybody else or a man
whether i can step over barriers or not whether i dare stoop to pick up or not whether i am a trembling creature or whether i have the
he cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort but was contemptuously silent
i want to prove one thing only that the devil led me on then and he has shown me since that i had not the right to take that path because i am just such a louse as all the rest
he was mocking me and here i ve come to you now
if i were not a louse should i have come to you
listen when i went then to the old woman s
do men go to commit a murder as i went then
i will tell you some day how i went
i crushed myself once for all for ever
but it was the devil that killed that old woman not i enough enough sonia enough
he cried in a sudden spasm of agony let me be
he leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands as in a vise
a wail of anguish broke from sonia
he asked suddenly raising his head and looking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair
she cried jumping up and her eyes that had been full of tears suddenly began to shine
she seized him by the shoulder he got up looking at her almost bewildered
go at once this very minute stand at the bow down first kiss the earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say to all men aloud i am a murderer
then god will send you life again
she asked him trembling all over snatching his two hands squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes full of fire
he was amazed at her sudden ecstasy
suffer and expiate your sin by it that s what you must do
no i am not going to them sonia
what will you live for cried sonia how is it possible now
why how can you talk to your mother
oh what will become of them now
you have abandoned your mother and your sister already
she cried why he knows it all himself
what will become of you now don t be a child sonia he said softly
they destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a virtue
they are knaves and scoundrels sonia
and what should i say to them that i murdered her but did not dare to take the money and hid it under a stone
why they would laugh at me and would call me a fool for not getting it
they wouldn t understand and they don t deserve to understand
it will be too much for you to bear too much
she repeated holding out her hands in despairing supplication
perhaps i ve been unfair to myself he observed gloomily pondering perhaps after all i am a man and not a louse and i ve been in too great a hurry to condemn myself
a haughty smile appeared on his lips
and your whole life your whole life
i shall get used to it he said grimly and thoughtfully
listen he began a minute later stop crying it s time to talk of the facts i ve come to tell you that the police are after me on my track
you want me to go to siberia and now you are frightened
but let me tell you i shall not give myself up
i shall make a struggle for it and they won t do anything to me
yesterday i was in great danger and believed i was lost but things are going better
all the facts they know can be explained two ways that s to say i can turn their accusations to my credit do you understand
and i shall for i ve learnt my lesson
but they will certainly arrest me
if it had not been for something that happened they would have done so for certain perhaps even now they will arrest me
but that s no matter sonia they ll let me out again for there isn t any real proof against me and there won t be i give you my word for it
and they can t convict a man on what they have against me
i only tell you that you may know
i will try to manage somehow to put it to my mother and sister so that they won t be frightened
my sister s future is secure however now i believe
will you come and see me in prison when i am there
they sat side by side both mournful and dejected as though they had been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore
he looked at sonia and felt how great was her love for him and strange to say he felt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved
yes it was a strange and awful sensation
on his way to see sonia he had felt that all his hopes rested on her he expected to be rid of at least part of his suffering and now when all her heart turned towards him he suddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than before
sonia he said you d better not come and see me when i am in prison
sonia did not answer she was crying
she asked as though suddenly thinking of it
he did not at first understand the question
here take this one of cypress wood
i have another a copper one that belonged to lizaveta
i changed with lizaveta she gave me her cross
i will wear lizaveta s now and give you this
it s mine you know she begged him
we will go to suffer together and together we will bear our cross
he did not want to hurt her feelings
but immediately he drew back the hand he held out for the cross
better later he added to comfort her
yes yes better she repeated with conviction when you go to meet your suffering then put it on
you will come to me i ll put it on you we will pray and go together
at that moment someone knocked three times at the door
they heard in a very familiar and polite voice
sonia rushed to the door in a fright
the flaxen head of lebeziatnikov appeared at the door
chapter v lebeziatnikov looked perturbed
i ve come to you sofya semyonovna he began
i thought i should find you he said addressing raskolnikov suddenly that is i didn t mean anything of that sort
katerina ivanovna has gone out of her mind he blurted out suddenly turning from raskolnikov to sonia
but we don t know what to do you see
she came back she seems to have been turned out somewhere perhaps beaten
she had run to your father s former chief she didn t find him at home he was dining at some other general s
only fancy she rushed off there to the other general s and imagine she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to see her had him fetched out from dinner it seems
she was turned out of course but according to her own story she abused him and threw something at him
how it is she wasn t taken up i can t understand
now she is telling everyone including amalia ivanovna but it s difficult to understand her she is screaming and flinging herself about
oh yes she shouts that since everyone has abandoned her she will take the children and go into the street with a and the children will sing and dance and she too and collect money and will go every day under the general s window to let everyone see children whose father was an official begging in the street
she keeps beating the children and they are all crying
she is teaching lida to sing my village the boy to dance polenka the same
she is tearing up all the clothes and making them little caps like actors she means to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle instead of music
lebeziatnikov would have gone on but sonia who had heard him almost breathless snatched up her cloak and hat and ran out of the room putting on her things as she went
raskolnikov followed her and lebeziatnikov came after him
he said to raskolnikov as they went out into the street
i didn t want to frighten sofya semyonovna so i said it seemed like it but there isn t a doubt of it
they say that in consumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain it s a pity i know nothing of medicine
i did try to persuade her but she wouldn t listen
did you talk to her about the tubercles
besides she wouldn t have understood
but what i say is that if you convince a person logically that he has nothing to cry about he ll stop crying
is it your conviction that he won t
life would be too easy if it were so answered raskolnikov
excuse me excuse me of course it would be rather difficult for katerina ivanovna to understand but do you know that in paris they have been conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the insane simply by logical argument
one professor there a scientific man of standing lately dead believed in the possibility of such treatment
his idea was that there s nothing really wrong with the physical organism of the insane and that insanity is so to say a logical mistake an error of judgment an incorrect view of things
he gradually showed the madman his error and would you believe it they say he was successful
but as he made use of douches too how far success was due to that treatment remains uncertain
raskolnikov had long ceased to listen
reaching the house where he lived he nodded to lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate
lebeziatnikov woke up with a start looked about him and hurried on
raskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middle of it
he looked at the yellow and tattered paper at the dust at his sofa
from the yard came a loud continuous knocking someone seemed to be hammering
he went to the window rose on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of absorbed attention
but the yard was empty and he could not see who was hammering
in the house on the left he saw some open windows on the were pots of geraniums
linen was hung out of the windows
he turned away and sat down on the sofa
never never had he felt himself so fearfully alone
yes he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate sonia now that he had made her more miserable
why had he gone to her to beg for her tears
what need had he to poison her life
i will remain alone he said resolutely and she shall not come to the prison
five minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile
perhaps it really would be better in siberia he thought suddenly
he could not have said how long he sat there with vague thoughts surging through his mind
all at once the door opened and dounia came in
at first she stood still and looked at him from the doorway just as he had done at sonia then she came in and sat down in the same place as yesterday on the chair facing him
he looked silently and almost vacantly at her
don t be angry brother i ve only come for one minute said dounia
her face looked thoughtful but not stern
he saw that she too had come to him with love
dmitri prokofitch has explained and told me everything
they are worrying and persecuting you through a stupid and contemptible suspicion
dmitri prokofitch told me that there is no danger and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such horror
i don t think so and i fully understand how indignant you must be and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you
as for your cutting yourself off from us i don t judge you i don t venture to judge you and forgive me for having blamed you for it
i feel that i too if i had so great a trouble should keep away from everyone
i shall tell mother nothing but i shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that you will come very soon
don t worry about her will set her mind at rest but don t you try her too much come once at least remember that she is your mother
and now i have come simply to say dounia began to get up that if you should need me or should need all my life or anything call me and i ll come
she turned abruptly and went towards the door
raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her
that razumihin dmitri prokofitch is a very good fellow
well she asked waiting a moment
he is competent hardworking honest and capable of real love
dounia flushed crimson then suddenly she took alarm
are we really parting for ever that you give me such a parting message
he turned away and walked to the window
she stood a moment looked at him uneasily and went out troubled
there was an instant the very last one when he had longed to take her in his arms and to her and even her but he had not dared even to touch her hand
afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that i embraced her and will feel that i stole her kiss
he went on a few minutes later to himself
no she wouldn t girls like that can t stand things
there was a breath of fresh air from the window
he took up his cap and went out
he could not of course and would not consider how ill he was
but all this continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him
and if he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this continual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession of his faculties
but this artificial excitement could not last long
a special form of misery had begun to oppress him of late
there was nothing poignant nothing acute about it but there was a feeling of permanence of eternity about it it brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery a foretaste of an eternity on a square yard of space
towards evening this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily
with this idiotic purely physical weakness depending on the sunset or something one can t help doing something stupid
you ll go to dounia as well as to sonia he muttered bitterly
only fancy i ve been to your room looking for you
only fancy she s carried out her plan and taken away the children
sofya semyonovna and i have had a job to find them
she is rapping on a and making the children dance
they keep stopping at the and in front of shops there s a crowd of fools running after them
raskolnikov asked anxiously hurrying after lebeziatnikov
that is it s not sofya semyonovna s frantic but katerina ivanovna though sofya semyonova s frantic too
but katerina ivanovna is absolutely frantic
you can fancy what an effect that will have
they are on the canal bank near the bridge now not far from sofya semyonovna s quite close
on the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one where sonia lodged there was a crowd of people consisting principally of gutter children
the hoarse broken voice of katerina ivanovna could be heard from the bridge and it certainly was a strange spectacle likely to attract a street crowd
katerina ivanovna in her old dress with the green shawl wearing a torn straw hat crushed in a hideous way on one side was really frantic
she was exhausted and breathless
her wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever and indeed out of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home
but her excitement did not flag and every moment her irritation grew more intense
she rushed at the children shouted at them coaxed them told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing began explaining to them why it was necessary and driven to desperation by their not understanding beat them
then she would make a rush at the crowd if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look she immediately appealed to him to see what these children from a genteel one may say aristocratic house had been brought to
if she heard laughter or jeering in the crowd she would rush at once at the scoffers and begin squabbling with them
some people laughed others shook their heads but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the frightened children
the of which lebeziatnikov had spoken was not there at least raskolnikov did not see it
but instead of rapping on the pan katerina ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands when she made lida and kolya dance and polenka sing
she too joined in the singing but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough which made her curse in despair and even shed tears
what made her most furious was the weeping and terror of kolya and lida
some effort had been made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed
the boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a turk
there had been no costume for lida she simply had a red knitted cap or rather a night cap that had belonged to marmeladov decorated with a broken piece of white ostrich feather which had been katerina ivanovna s grandmother s and had been preserved as a family possession
polenka was in her everyday dress she looked in timid perplexity at her mother and kept at her side hiding her tears
she dimly realised her mother s condition and looked uneasily about her
she was terribly frightened of the street and the crowd
sonia followed katerina ivanovna weeping and beseeching her to return home but katerina ivanovna was not to be persuaded
leave off sonia leave off she shouted speaking fast panting and coughing
you don t know what you ask you are like a child
i ve told you before that i am not coming back to that drunken german
let everyone let all petersburg see the children begging in the streets though their father was an honourable man who served all his life in truth and fidelity and one may say died in the service
katerina ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly believed it
let that wretch of a general see it
and you are silly sonia what have we to eat
we have worried you enough i won t go on so
ah rodion romanovitch is that you
she cried seeing raskolnikov and rushing up to him
explain to this silly girl please that nothing better could be done
even earn their living and everyone will see at once that we are different that we are an honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary
and that general will lose his post you ll see
we shall perform under his windows every day and if the tsar drives by i ll fall on my knees put the children before me show them to him and say defend us father
he is the father of the fatherless he is merciful he ll protect us you ll see and that wretch of a general
goodness what am i to do with them rodion romanovitch
if you only knew how stupid they are
what s one to do with such children
and she almost crying herself which did not stop her uninterrupted rapid flow of talk pointed to the crying children
raskolnikov tried to persuade her to go home and even said hoping to work on her vanity that it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like an as she was intending to become the principal of a
a castle in the air cried katerina ivanovna her laugh ending in a cough
no rodion romanovitch that dream is over
you know rodion romanovitch i threw an inkpot at him it happened to be standing in the by the paper where you sign your name
i wrote my name threw it at him and ran away
oh the scoundrels the scoundrels
but enough of them now i ll provide for the children myself i won t bow down to anybody
she has had to bear enough for us
they give us nothing only run after us putting their tongues out
there what is that blockhead laughing at
she pointed to a man in the crowd
it s all because kolya here is so stupid i have such a bother with him
why i ve taught you you know some phrases
else how are you to show that you are of good family well children and not at all like other
we aren t going to have a punch and judy show in the street but to sing a genteel song
you keep putting me out but we you see we are standing here rodion romanovitch to find something to sing and get money something kolya can dance to
for as you can fancy our performance is all impromptu
we must talk it over and rehearse it all thoroughly and then we shall go to nevsky where there are far more people of good society and we shall be noticed at once
lida knows my village only nothing but my village and everyone sings that
we must sing something far more genteel
well have you thought of anything polenka
my memory s quite gone or i should have thought of something
ah let us sing in french cinq sous i have taught it you i have taught it you
and as it is in french people will see at once that you are children of good family and that will be much more touching
you might sing marlborough s en guerre for that s quite a child s song and is sung as a lullaby in all the aristocratic houses
s en guerre ne sait quand she began singing
now kolya your hands on your hips make haste and you lida keep turning the other way and polenka and i will sing and clap our hands
sous cinq sous pour monter notre
set your dress straight polenka it s slipped down on your shoulders she observed panting from coughing
now it s particularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly that all may see that you are children
i said at the time that the bodice should be cut longer and made of two widths
it was your fault sonia with your advice to make it shorter and now you see the child is quite deformed by it
a policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd
but at that moment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat a official of about fifty with a decoration on his neck which delighted katerina ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman approached and without a word handed her a green note
his face wore a look of genuine sympathy
katerina ivanovna took it and gave him a polite even ceremonious bow
i thank you honoured sir she began loftily
the causes that have induced us take the money polenka you see there are generous and honourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress
you see honoured sir these orphans of good family i might even say of aristocratic connections and that wretch of a general sat eating grouse and stamped at my disturbing him
your excellency i said protect the orphans for you knew my late husband semyon zaharovitch and on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his only
protect me she cried to the official
why is that policeman edging up to me
we have only just run away from one of them
it s you re making a disturbance
it s just the same as if i were grinding an organ
you have to get a licence for an organ and you haven t got one and in that way you collect a crowd
what a license wailed katerina ivanovna
what need of a license calm yourself madam calm yourself began the official
this is no place for you in the crowd
honoured sir honoured sir you don t know screamed katerina ivanovna
kolya lida where are they off to
kolya and lida scared out of their wits by the crowd and their mother s mad pranks suddenly seized each other by the hand and ran off at the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere
weeping and wailing poor katerina ivanovna ran after them
she was a piteous and unseemly spectacle as she ran weeping and panting for breath
sonia and polenka rushed after them
bring them back bring them back sonia
she stumbled as she ran and fell down
she s cut herself she s bleeding
raskolnikov and lebeziatnikov were the first at her side the official too hastened up and behind him the policeman who muttered bother
with a gesture of impatience feeling that the job was going to be a troublesome one
he said to the crowd that pressed forward
she s gone out of her mind said another
lord have mercy upon us said a woman crossing herself
have they caught the little girl and the boy
they re being brought back the elder one s got them
when they examined katerina ivanovna carefully they saw that she had not cut herself against a stone as sonia thought but that the blood that stained the pavement red was from her chest
i ve seen that before muttered the official to raskolnikov and lebeziatnikov that s consumption the blood flows and chokes the patient
i saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago nearly a pint of blood all in a minute
see that house the second from here
come to me make haste she turned from one to the other
thanks to the official s efforts this plan was adopted the policeman even helping to carry katerina ivanovna
she was carried to sonia s room almost unconscious and laid on the bed
the blood was still flowing but she seemed to be coming to herself
raskolnikov lebeziatnikov and the official accompanied sonia into the room and were followed by the policeman who first drove back the crowd which followed to the very door
polenka came in holding kolya and lida who were trembling and weeping
several persons came in too from the kapernaumovs room the landlord a lame man of strange appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush his wife a woman with an everlastingly scared expression and several children with faces
among these svidriga√Ølov suddenly made his appearance
raskolnikov looked at him with surprise not understanding where he had come from and not having noticed him in the crowd
a doctor and priest wore spoken of
the official whispered to raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now for the doctor but he ordered him to be sent for
meanwhile katerina ivanovna had regained her breath
she looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at sonia who stood pale and trembling wiping the sweat from her brow with a handkerchief
they sat her up on the bed supporting her on both sides
once more her parched lips were covered with blood
she moved her eyes looking about her
never once have i been in your room
she looked at her with a face of suffering
well here they are sonia take them all
i hand them over to you i ve had enough
lay me down let me die in peace
they laid her back on the pillow
you haven t got a rouble to spare
god must forgive me without that
and if he won t forgive me i don t care
she sank more and more into uneasy delirium
at times she shuddered turned her eyes from side to side recognised everyone for a minute but at once sank into delirium again
her breathing was hoarse and difficult there was a sort of rattle in her throat
i said to him your excellency she ejaculated gasping after each word
lida kolya hands on your hips make haste
tap with your heels be a graceful child
hast die sch√∂nsten augen m√§dchen was willst du mehr what an idea
in the heat of midday in the vale of dagestan
i loved that song to distraction polenka
your father you know used to sing it when we were engaged
oh that s the thing for us to sing
she was violently excited and tried to sit up
at last in a horribly hoarse broken voice she began shrieking and gasping at every word with a look of growing terror
she wailed suddenly with a scream and a flood of tears protect the orphans
you have been their father s guest
she started regaining consciousness and gazed at all with a sort of terror but at once recognised sonia
she articulated softly and caressingly as though surprised to find her there
she cried with vindictive despair and her head fell heavily back on the pillow
she sank into unconsciousness again but this time it did not last long
her pale yellow wasted face dropped back her mouth fell open her leg moved convulsively she gave a deep deep sigh and died
sonia fell upon her flung her arms about her and remained motionless with her head pressed to the dead woman s wasted bosom
polenka threw herself at her mother s feet kissing them and weeping violently
though kolya and lida did not understand what had happened they had a feeling that it was something terrible they put their hands on each other s little shoulders stared straight at one another and both at once opened their mouths and began screaming
they were both still in their fancy dress one in a turban the other in the cap with the ostrich feather
and how did the certificate of merit come to be on the bed beside katerina ivanovna
it lay there by the pillow raskolnikov saw it
lebeziatnikov skipped up to him
rodion romanovitch i must have two words with you said svidriga√Ølov coming up to them
lebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew
svidriga√Ølov drew raskolnikov further away
i will undertake all the arrangements the funeral and that
you know it s a question of money and as i told you i have plenty to spare
i will put those two little ones and polenka into some good orphan asylum and i will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming of age so that sofya semyonovna need have no anxiety about them
and i will pull her out of the mud too for she is a good girl isn t she
so tell avdotya romanovna that that is how i am spending her ten thousand
what is your motive for such benevolence asked raskolnikov
ah you sceptical person laughed svidriga√Ølov
i told you i had no need of that money
won t you admit that it s simply done from humanity
she wasn t a louse you know he pointed to the corner where the dead woman lay was she like some old pawnbroker woman
come you ll agree is luzhin to go on living and doing wicked things or is she to die
and if i didn t help them polenka would go the same way
he said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness keeping his eyes fixed on raskolnikov who turned white and cold hearing his own phrases spoken to sonia
he quickly stepped back and looked wildly at svidriga√Ølov
he whispered hardly able to breathe
why i lodge here at madame resslich s the other side of the wall
here is kapernaumov and there lives madame resslich an old and devoted friend of mine
you yes continued svidriga√Ølov shaking with laughter
i assure you on my honour dear rodion romanovitch that you have interested me enormously
i told you we should become friends i foretold it
and you will see what an accommodating person i am
you ll see that you can get on with me
a strange period began for raskolnikov it was as though a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there was no escape
recalling that period long after he believed that his mind had been clouded at times and that it had continued so with intervals till the final catastrophe
he was convinced that he had been mistaken about many things at that time for instance as to the date of certain events
anyway when he tried later on to piece his recollections together he learnt a great deal about himself from what other people told him
he had mixed up incidents and had explained events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination
at times he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness amounting sometimes to panic
but he remembered too moments hours perhaps whole days of complete apathy which came upon him as a reaction from his previous terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility sometimes seen in the dying
he seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape from a full and clear understanding of his position
certain essential facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome to him
how glad he would have been to be free from some cares the neglect of which would have threatened him with complete inevitable ruin
he was particularly worried about svidriga√Ølov he might be said to be permanently thinking of svidriga√Ølov
from the time of svidriga√Ølov s too menacing and unmistakable words in sonia s room at the moment of katerina ivanovna s death the normal working of his mind seemed to break down
but although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it
at times finding himself in a solitary and remote part of the town in some wretched sitting alone lost in thought hardly knowing how he had come there he suddenly thought of svidriga√Ølov
he recognised suddenly clearly and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an understanding with that man and to make what terms he could
walking outside the city gates one day he positively fancied that they had fixed a meeting there that he was waiting for svidriga√Ølov
another time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes and could not at first understand how he had come there
but during the two or three days after katerina ivanovna s death he had two or three times met svidriga√Ølov at sonia s lodging where he had gone aimlessly for a moment
they exchanged a few words and made no reference to the vital subject as though they were tacitly agreed not to speak of it for a time
katerina ivanovna s body was still lying in the coffin svidriga√Ølov was busy making arrangements for the funeral
at their last meeting svidriga√Ølov informed raskolnikov that he had made an arrangement and a very satisfactory one for katerina ivanovna s children that he had through certain connections succeeded in getting hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at once placed in very suitable institutions that the money he had settled on them had been of great assistance as it is much easier to place orphans with some property than destitute ones
he said something too about sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see raskolnikov mentioning that he would like to consult with him that there were things they must talk over
this conversation took place in the passage on the stairs
svidriga√Ølov looked intently at raskolnikov and suddenly after a brief pause dropping his voice asked but how is it rodion romanovitch you don t seem yourself
you look and you listen but you don t seem to understand
we ll talk things over i am only sorry i ve so much to do of my own business and other people s
ah rodion romanovitch he added suddenly what all men need is fresh air fresh air
he moved to one side to make way for the priest and server who were coming up the stairs
they had come for the requiem service
by svidriga√Ølov s orders it was sung twice a day punctually
raskolnikov stood still a moment thought and followed the priest into sonia s room
they began quietly slowly and mournfully singing the service
from his childhood the thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive and mysteriously awful and it was long since he had heard the requiem service
and there was something else here as well too awful and disturbing
he looked at the children they were all kneeling by the coffin polenka was weeping
behind them sonia prayed softly and as it were timidly weeping
these last two days she hasn t said a word to me she hasn t glanced at me raskolnikov thought suddenly
the sunlight was bright in the room the incense rose in clouds the priest read give rest oh lord
raskolnikov stayed all through the service
as he blessed them and took his leave the priest looked round strangely
after the service raskolnikov went up to sonia
she took both his hands and let her head sink on his shoulder
this slight friendly gesture bewildered raskolnikov
it seemed strange to him that there was no trace of repugnance no trace of disgust no tremor in her hand
it was the furthest limit of at least so he interpreted it
raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out
if it had been possible to escape to some solitude he would have thought himself lucky even if he had to spend his whole life there
but although he had almost always been by himself of late he had never been able to feel alone
sometimes he walked out of the town on to the high road once he had even reached a little wood but the lonelier the place was the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near him
it did not frighten him but greatly annoyed him so that he made haste to return to the town to mingle with the crowd to enter restaurants and taverns to walk in busy thoroughfares
there he felt easier and even more solitary
one day at dusk he sat for an hour listening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively enjoyed it
but at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again as though his conscience smote him
here i sit listening to singing is that what i ought to be doing
yet he felt at once that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness there was something requiring immediate decision but it was something he could not clearly understand or put into words
better porfiry again or svidriga√Ølov
he went out of the tavern and rushed away almost at a run
the thought of dounia and his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic
that night he woke up before morning among some bushes in krestovsky island trembling all over with fever he walked home and it was early morning when he arrived
after some hours sleep the fever left him but he woke up late two o clock in the afternoon
he remembered that katerina ivanovna s funeral had been fixed for that day and was glad that he was not present at it
nastasya brought him some food he ate and drank with appetite almost with greediness
his head was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three days
he even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic
the door opened and razumihin came in
ah he s eating then he s not ill said razumihin
he took a chair and sat down at the table opposite raskolnikov
he was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it
he spoke with evident annoyance but without hurry or raising his voice
he looked as though he had some special fixed determination
as far as i am concerned you may all go to hell but from what i see it s clear to me that i can t make head or tail of it please don t think i ve come to ask you questions
if you begin telling me your secrets i dare say i shouldn t stay to listen i should go away cursing
i have only come to find out once for all whether it s a fact that you are mad
there is a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so
i admit i ve been disposed to that opinion myself judging from your stupid repulsive and quite inexplicable actions and from your recent behavior to your mother and sister
only a monster or a madman could treat them as you have so you must be mad
haven t you seen them since then
what have you been doing with yourself
i ve been to you three times already
your mother has been seriously ill since yesterday
she had made up her mind to come to you avdotya romanovna tried to prevent her she wouldn t hear a word
if he is ill if his mind is giving way who can look after him like his mother
we all came here together we couldn t let her come alone all the way
we came in you weren t here she sat down and stayed ten minutes while we stood waiting in silence
she got up and said if he s gone out that is if he is well and has forgotten his mother it s humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for kindness
she returned home and took to her bed now she is in a fever
i see she said that he has time for
she means by sofya semyonovna your betrothed or your mistress i don t know
i went at once to sofya semyonovna s for i wanted to know what was going on
i looked round i saw the coffin the children crying and sofya semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses
i apologised came away and reported to avdotya romanovna
and you haven t got a girl the most likely thing is that you are mad
but here you sit guzzling boiled beef as though you d not had a bite for three days
though as far as that goes madmen eat too but though you have not said a word to me yet
so you may go to hell all of you for there s some mystery some secret about it and i don t intend to worry my brains over your secrets
so i ve simply come to swear at you he finished getting up to relieve my mind
what business is it of yours what i mean to do
you are going in for a drinking bout
you always have been a very rational person and you ve never been mad never he observed suddenly with warmth
i was talking with my sister the day before yesterday i think it was about you razumihin
but where can you have seen her the day before yesterday
razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale
one could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and violently
she came here by herself sat there and talked to me
i told her you were a very good honest and industrious man
i didn t tell her you love her because she knows that herself
wherever i might go whatever happened to me you would remain to look after them
i so to speak give them into your keeping razumihin
i say this because i know quite well how you love her and am convinced of the purity of your heart
i know that she too may love you and perhaps does love you already
now decide for yourself as you know best whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not
of course if it s all a secret never mind
i shall find out the secret and i am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense and that you ve made it all up
anyway you are a capital fellow a capital fellow
that was just what i wanted to add only you interrupted that that was a very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets
leave it to time don t worry about it
you ll know it all in time when it must be
yesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air fresh air fresh air
i mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant by that
razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement making a silent conclusion
and he s on the eve of some desperate step that s certain
and and dounia knows he thought suddenly
so avdotya romanovna comes to see you he said weighing each syllable and you re going to see a man who says we need more air and so of course that letter that too must have something to do with it he concluded to himself
it upset her very much very much indeed
i began speaking of you she begged me not to
then then she said that perhaps we should very soon have to part
then she began warmly thanking me for something then she went to her room and locked herself in
there was a time brother when i
he hurried out but when he had almost closed the door behind him he suddenly opened it again and said looking away
oh by the way do you remember that murder you know porfiry s that old woman
do you know the murderer has been found he has confessed and given the proofs
it s one of those very workmen the painter only fancy
do you remember i defended them here
would you believe it all that scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on the stairs while the porter and the two witnesses were going up he got up on purpose to disarm suspicion
the cunning the presence of mind of the young dog
one can hardly credit it but it s his own explanation he has confessed it all
well he s simply a genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of the lawyers so there s nothing much to wonder at i suppose
of course people like that are always possible
and the fact that he couldn t keep up the character but confessed makes him easier to believe in
tell me please from whom did you hear that and why does it interest you so
raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation
well i heard it from porfiry among others
it was from him i heard almost all about it
from porfiry from what what did he say
he gave me a capital explanation of it
psychologically after his fashion
i ll tell you all about it another time but now i m busy
there was a time when i fancied
what need is there for me to drink now
you have made me drunk without wine
he s a political conspirator there s not a doubt about it razumihin decided as he slowly descended the stairs
and he s drawn his sister in that s quite quite in keeping with avdotya romanovna s character
there are interviews between them
so many of her words and hints bear that meaning
and how else can all this tangle be explained
yes i took leave of my senses and i wronged him
it was his doing under the lamp in the corridor that day
what a crude nasty vile idea on my part
nikolay is a brick for confessing
his illness then all his strange actions before this in the university how morose he used to be how gloomy
but what s the meaning now of that letter
there s something in that too perhaps
he thought of dounia realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed and he suddenly broke into a run
as soon as razumihin went out raskolnikov got up turned to the window walked into one corner and then into another as though forgetting the smallness of his room and sat down again on the sofa
he felt so to speak renewed again the struggle so a means of escape had come
it had been too stifling too cramping the burden had been too agonising
a lethargy had come upon him at times
from the moment of the scene with nikolay at porfiry s he had been suffocating penned in without hope of escape
after nikolay s confession on that very day had come the scene with sonia his behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he could have imagined beforehand he had grown feebler instantly and fundamentally
and he had agreed at the time with sonia he had agreed in his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his mind
he worried him that was true but somehow not on the same point
he might still have a struggle to come with svidriga√Ølov
svidriga√Ølov too might be a means of escape but porfiry was a different matter
and so porfiry himself had explained it to razumihin had explained it
he had begun bringing in his damned psychology again
but to think that porfiry should for one moment believe that nikolay was guilty after what had passed between them before nikolay s appearance after that interview which could have only explanation
during those days raskolnikov had often recalled passages in that scene with porfiry he could not bear to let his mind rest on it
such words such gestures had passed between them they had exchanged such glances things had been said in such a tone and had reached such a pass that nikolay whom porfiry had seen through at the first word at the first gesture could not have shaken his conviction
and to think that even razumihin had begun to suspect
the scene in the corridor under the lamp had produced its effect then
but what had induced the latter to receive him like that
what had been his object in putting razumihin off with nikolay
he must have some plan there was some design but what was it
it was true that a long time had passed since that morning too long a time and no sight nor sound of porfiry
raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room still pondering
it was the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind at least
i must settle svidriga√Ølov he thought and as soon as possible he too seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own accord
and at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his weary heart that he might have killed either of those two porfiry or svidriga√Ølov
at least he felt that he would be capable of doing it later if not now
we shall see we shall see he repeated to himself
but no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon porfiry himself in the passage
raskolnikov was dumbfounded for a minute but only for one minute
strange to say he was not very much astonished at seeing porfiry and scarcely afraid of him
he was simply startled but was quickly instantly on his guard
but how could porfiry have approached so quietly like a cat so that he had heard nothing
could he have been listening at the door
you didn t expect a visitor rodion romanovitch porfiry explained laughing
i ve been meaning to look in a long time i was passing by and thought why not go in for five minutes
sit down porfiry petrovitch sit down
raskolnikov gave his visitor a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have marvelled at himself if he could have seen it
the last moment had come the last drops had to be drained
so a man will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand yet when the knife is at his throat at last he feels no fear
raskolnikov seated himself directly facing porfiry and looked at him without flinching
porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a cigarette
speak speak seemed as though it would burst from raskolnikov s heart
come why don t you speak chapter ii ah these cigarettes
porfiry petrovitch ejaculated at last having lighted one
they are pernicious positively pernicious and yet i can t give them up
i cough i begin to have tickling in my throat and a difficulty in breathing
you know i am a coward i went lately to b n he always gives at least half an hour to each patient
he positively laughed looking at me he sounded me tobacco s bad for you he said your lungs are affected
what is there to take its place
i don t drink that s the mischief that i don t
everything is relative rodion romanovitch everything is relative
why he s playing his professional tricks again raskolnikov thought with disgust
all the circumstances of their last interview suddenly came back to him and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon him then
i came to see you the day before yesterday in the evening you didn t know
porfiry petrovitch went on looking round the room
i was passing by just as i did and i thought i d return your call
i walked in as your door was wide open i looked round waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant
raskolnikov s face grew more and more gloomy
porfiry seemed to guess his state of mind
i ve come to have it out with you rodion romanovitch my dear fellow
i owe you an explanation and must give it to you he continued with a slight smile just patting raskolnikov s knee
but almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his face to his surprise raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it
he had never seen and never suspected such an expression in his face
a strange scene passed between us last time we met rodion romanovitch
our first interview too was a strange one but then and one thing after another
this is the point i have perhaps acted unfairly to you i feel it
your nerves were unhinged and your knees were shaking and so were mine
and you know our behaviour was unseemly even ungentlemanly
and yet we are gentlemen above all in any case gentlemen that must be understood
do you remember what we came to
what is he up to what does he take me for
raskolnikov asked himself in amazement raising his head and looking with open eyes on porfiry
i ve decided openness is better between us porfiry petrovitch went on turning his head away and dropping his eyes as though unwilling to disconcert his former victim and as though disdaining his former wiles
yes such suspicions and such scenes can not continue for long
nikolay put a stop to it or i don t know what we might not have come to
that damned workman was sitting at the time in the next room can you realise that
you know that of course and i am aware that he came to you afterwards
but what you supposed then was not true i had not sent for anyone i had made no kind of arrangements
it had all come upon me so suddenly
i had scarcely sent for the porters you noticed them as you went out i dare say
an idea flashed upon me i was firmly convinced at the time you see rodion romanovitch
come i thought even if i let one thing slip for a time i shall get hold of something else i shan t lose what i want anyway
you are nervously irritable rodion romanovitch by temperament it s out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character which i flatter myself i have to some extent divined
of course i did reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and blurts out his whole story
it does happen sometimes if you make a man lose all patience though even then it s rare
i was capable of realising that
if i only had a fact i thought the least little fact to go upon something i could lay hold of something tangible not merely psychological
for if a man is guilty you must be able to get something substantial out of him one may reckon upon most surprising results indeed
i was reckoning on your temperament rodion romanovitch on your temperament above all things
i had great hopes of you at that time
but what are you driving at now
raskolnikov muttered at last asking the question without thinking
he wondered distractedly does he really take me to be innocent
i ve come to explain myself i consider it my duty so to speak
i want to make clear to you how the whole business the whole misunderstanding arose
i ve caused you a great deal of suffering rodion romanovitch
i understand what it must mean for a man who has been unfortunate but who is proud imperious and above all impatient to have to bear such treatment
i regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without elements of magnanimity though i don t agree with all your convictions
i wanted to tell you this first frankly and quite sincerely for above all i don t want to deceive you
when i made your acquaintance i felt attracted by you
perhaps you will laugh at my saying so
i know you disliked me from the first and indeed you ve no reason to like me
you may think what you like but i desire now to do all i can to efface that impression and to show that i am a man of heart and conscience
porfiry petrovitch made a dignified pause
raskolnikov felt a rush of renewed alarm
the thought that porfiry believed him to be innocent began to make him uneasy
it s scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail porfiry petrovitch went on
indeed i could scarcely attempt it
to begin with there were rumours
through whom how and when those rumours came to me and how they affected you i need not go into
my suspicions were aroused by a complete accident which might just as easily not have happened
i believe there is no need to go into that either
those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind
i admit it openly for one may as well make a clean breast of it i was the first to pitch on you
the old woman s notes on the pledges and the rest of it that all came to nothing
i happened too to hear of the scene at the office from a man who described it capitally unconsciously reproducing the scene with great vividness
it was just one thing after another rodion romanovitch my dear fellow
how could i avoid being brought to certain ideas
from a hundred rabbits you can t make a horse a hundred suspicions don t make a proof as the english proverb says but that s only from the rational point of view you can t help being partial for after all a lawyer is only human
i thought too of your article in that journal do you remember on your first visit we talked of it
i jeered at you at the time but that was only to lead you on
i repeat rodion romanovitch you are ill and impatient
that you were bold headstrong in earnest and had felt a great deal i recognised long before
i too have felt the same so that your article seemed familiar to me
it was conceived on sleepless nights with a throbbing heart in ecstasy and suppressed enthusiasm
and that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is dangerous
i jeered at you then but let me tell you that as a literary amateur i am awfully fond of such first essays full of the heat of youth
there is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist
your article is absurd and fantastic but there s a transparent sincerity a youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it
it s a gloomy article but that s what s fine in it
i read your article and put it aside thinking as i did so that man won t go the common way
well i ask you after that as a preliminary how could i help being carried away by what followed
oh dear i am not saying anything i am not making any statement now
there s nothing in it that is really nothing and perhaps absolutely nothing
and it s not at all the thing for the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions here i have nikolay on my hands with actual evidence against him you may think what you like of it but it s evidence
he brings in his psychology too one has to consider him too for it s a matter of life and death
why am i explaining this to you
that you may understand and not blame my malicious behaviour on that occasion
it was not malicious i assure you
do you suppose i didn t come to search your room at the time
i was here when you were lying ill in bed not officially not in my own person but i was here
your room was searched to the last thread at the first suspicion but
i thought to myself now that man will come will come of himself and quickly too if he s guilty he s sure to come
another man wouldn t but he will
and you remember how razumihin began discussing the subject with you
we arranged that to excite you so we purposely spread rumours that he might discuss the case with you and razumihin is not a man to restrain his indignation
zametov was tremendously struck by your anger and your open daring
think of blurting out in a restaurant i killed her
i thought so myself if he is guilty he will be a formidable opponent
that was what i thought at the time
but you simply bowled zametov over and
well you see it all lies in this that this damnable psychology can be taken two ways
well i kept expecting you and so it was you came
your laughter too as you came in do you remember
i saw it all plain as daylight but if i hadn t expected you so specially i should not have noticed anything in your laughter
you see what influence a mood has
razumihin then ah that stone that stone under which the things were hidden
i seem to see it somewhere in a kitchen garden
it was in a kitchen garden you told zametov and afterwards you repeated that in my office
and when we began picking your article to pieces how you explained it
one could take every word of yours in two senses as though there were another meaning hidden
so in this way rodion romanovitch i reached the furthest limit and knocking my head against a post i pulled myself up asking myself what i was about
after all i said you can take it all in another sense if you like and it s more natural so indeed
i couldn t help admitting it was more natural
no i d better get hold of some little fact i said
so when i heard of the i held my breath and was all in a tremor
here is my little fact thought i and i didn t think it over i simply wouldn t
i would have given a thousand roubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes when you walked a hundred paces beside that workman after he had called you murderer to your face and you did not dare to ask him a question all the way
and then what about your trembling what about your in your illness in
and so rodion romanovitch can you wonder that i played such pranks on you
and what made you come at that very minute
someone seemed to have sent you by jove
and if nikolay had not parted us and do you remember nikolay at the time
it was a thunderbolt a regular thunderbolt
i didn t believe in the thunderbolt not for a minute
you could see it for yourself and how could i
even afterwards when you had gone and he began making very very plausible answers on certain points so that i was surprised at him myself even then i didn t believe his story
you see what it is to be as firm as a rock
what has nikolay got to do with it
razumihin told me just now that you think nikolay guilty and had yourself assured him of it
his voice failed him and he broke off
he had been listening in indescribable agitation as this man who had seen through and through him went back upon himself
he was afraid of believing it and did not believe it
in those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for something more definite and conclusive
mr razumihin cried porfiry petrovitch seeming glad of a question from raskolnikov who had till then been silent
but i had to put razumihin off two is company three is none
razumihin is not the right man besides he is an outsider
he came running to me with a pale face
but never mind him why bring him in
to return to nikolay would you like to know what sort of a type he is how i understand him that is
to begin with he is still a child and not exactly a coward but something by way of an artist
really don t laugh at my describing him so
he is innocent and responsive to influence
he has a heart and is a fantastic fellow
he sings and dances he tells stories they say so that people come from other villages to hear him
he attends school too and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger to him he will drink himself senseless not as a regular vice but at times when people treat him like a child
and he stole too then without knowing it himself for how can it be stealing if one picks it up
and do you know he is an old believer or rather a dissenter
there have been wanderers in his family and he was for two years in his village under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder
i learnt all this from nikolay and from his fellow villagers
and what s more he wanted to run into the wilderness
he was full of fervour prayed at night read the old books the true ones and read himself crazy
petersburg had a great effect upon him especially the women and the wine
he responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that
i learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him and used to go and see him and now this business came upon him
well he was frightened he tried to hang himself
how can one get over the idea the people have of russian legal proceedings
the very word trial frightens some of them
we shall see what the new juries will do
well in prison it seems he remembered the venerable elder the bible too made its appearance again
do you know rodion romanovitch the force of the word suffering among some of these people
it s not a question of suffering for someone s benefit but simply one must suffer
if they suffer at the hands of the authorities so much the better
in my time there was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison always reading his bible on the stove at night and he read himself crazy and so crazy do you know that one day apropos of nothing he seized a brick and flung it at the governor though he had done him no harm
and the way he threw it too aimed it a yard on one side on purpose for fear of hurting him
well we know what happens to a prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon
so i suspect now that nikolay wants to take his suffering or something of the sort
i know it for certain from facts indeed
only he doesn t know that i know
what you don t admit that there are such fantastic people among the peasants
the elder now has begun influencing him especially since he tried to hang himself
but he ll come and tell me all himself
wait a bit he ll take his words back
i am waiting from hour to hour for him to come and abjure his evidence
i have come to like that nikolay and am studying him in detail
he answered me very plausibly on some points he obviously had collected some evidence and prepared himself cleverly
but on other points he is simply at sea knows nothing and doesn t even suspect that he doesn t know
no rodion romanovitch nikolay doesn t come in
this is a fantastic gloomy business a modern case an incident of when the heart of man is troubled when the phrase is quoted that blood renews when comfort is preached as the aim of life
here we have bookish dreams a heart unhinged by theories
here we see resolution in the first stage but resolution of a special kind he resolved to do it like jumping over a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the crime
he forgot to shut the door after him and murdered two people for a theory
he committed the murder and couldn t take the money and what he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone
it wasn t enough for him to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and rung the bell no he had to go to the empty lodging half delirious to recall the he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again
well that we grant was through illness but consider this he is a murderer but looks upon himself as an honest man despises others poses as injured innocence
no that s not the work of a nikolay my dear rodion romanovitch
all that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that these words were too great a shock
raskolnikov shuddered as though he had been stabbed
he asked in a breathless voice unable to restrain himself
porfiry petrovitch sank back in his chair as though he were amazed at the question
who is the murderer he repeated as though unable to believe his ears
you are the murderer he added almost in a whisper in a voice of genuine conviction
raskolnikov leapt from the sofa stood up for a few seconds and sat down again without uttering a word
your lip is twitching just as it did before porfiry petrovitch observed almost sympathetically
you ve been misunderstanding me i think rodion romanovitch he added after a brief pause that s why you are so surprised
i came on purpose to tell you everything and deal openly with you
it was not i murdered her raskolnikov whispered like a frightened child caught in the act
no it was you you rodion romanovitch and no one else porfiry whispered sternly with conviction
they were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long about ten minutes
raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers through his hair
porfiry petrovitch sat quietly waiting
suddenly raskolnikov looked scornfully at porfiry
you are at your old tricks again porfiry petrovitch
i wonder you don t get sick of it
oh stop that what does that matter now
it would be a different matter if there were witnesses present but we are whispering alone
you see yourself that i have not come to chase and capture you like a hare
whether you confess it or not is nothing to me now for myself i am convinced without it
i ask you the same question again if you consider me guilty why don t you take me to prison
i will answer you point for point
in the first place to arrest you so directly is not to my interest
if you are convinced you ought ach what if i am convinced
that s only my dream for the time
you know that s it since you ask me to do it
if i confront you with that workman for instance and you say to him were you drunk or not
i simply took you to be drunk and you were drunk too
well what could i answer especially as your story is a more likely one than his
for there s nothing but psychology to support his evidence that s almost unseemly with his ugly mug while you hit the mark exactly for the rascal is an inveterate drunkard and notoriously so
and i have myself admitted candidly several times already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the second way is stronger and looks far more probable and that apart from that i have as yet nothing against you
and though i shall put you in prison and indeed have come quite contrary to etiquette to inform you of it beforehand yet i tell you frankly also contrary to etiquette that it won t be to my advantage
well secondly i ve come to you because
yes yes secondly raskolnikov was listening breathless
because as i told you just now i consider i owe you an explanation
i don t want you to look upon me as a monster as i have a genuine liking for you you may believe me or not
and in the third place i ve come to you with a direct and open proposition that you should surrender and confess
it will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my advantage too for my task will be done
well is this open on my part or not
you said just now you have nothing but psychology to go on yet now you ve gone on mathematics
well what if you are mistaken yourself now no rodion romanovitch i am not mistaken
i have a little fact even then providence sent it me
what little fact i won t tell you what rodion romanovitch
and in any case i haven t the right to put it off any longer i must arrest you
so think it over it makes no difference to me
and so i speak only for your sake
believe me it will be better rodion romanovitch
that s not simply ridiculous it s positively shameless
why even if i were guilty which i don t admit what reason should i have to confess when you tell me yourself that i shall be in greater safety in prison
ah rodion romanovitch don t put too much faith in words perhaps prison will not be altogether a restful place
that s only theory and my theory and what authority am i for you
perhaps too even now i am hiding something from you
and how can you ask what advantage
don t you know how it would lessen your sentence
you would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken the crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case
i swear before god that i will so arrange that your confession shall come as a complete surprise
we will make a clean sweep of all these psychological points of a suspicion against you so that your crime will appear to have been something like an aberration for in truth it was an aberration
i am an honest man rodion romanovitch and will keep my word
raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink dejectedly
he pondered a long while and at last smiled again but his smile was sad and gentle
no he said apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearances with porfiry it s not worth it i don t care about lessening the sentence
that s just what i was afraid of
porfiry cried warmly and as it seemed involuntarily
that s just what i feared that you wouldn t care about the mitigation of sentence
raskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him
you have a great deal of it still before you
how can you say you don t want a mitigation of sentence
a great deal of what lies before me
what sort of prophet are you do you know much about it
this may be god s means for bringing you to him
and it s not for ever the bondage
the time will be shortened laughed raskolnikov
why is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of
it may be that you are afraid of it without knowing it because you are young
but anyway shouldn t be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing
raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt as though he did not want to speak aloud
he got up again as though he meant to go away but sat down again in evident despair
you ve lost faith and you think that i am grossly flattering you but how long has your life been
you made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke down and turned out to be not at all original
it turned out something base that s true but you are not hopelessly base
at least you didn t deceive yourself for long you went straight to the furthest point at one bound
i regard you as one of those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts their entrails out if only they have found faith or god
you have long needed a change of air
maybe nikolay is right in wanting to suffer
i know you don t believe in it but don t be fling yourself straight into life without deliberation don t be afraid the flood will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again
i only believe that you have long life before you
i know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared beforehand but maybe you will remember them after
it s as well that you only killed the old woman
if you d invented another theory you might perhaps have done something a thousand times more hideous
perhaps god is saving you for something
but keep a good heart and have less fear
are you afraid of the great expiation before you
no it would be shameful to be afraid of it
since you have taken such a step you must harden your heart
you must fulfil the demands of justice
i know that you don t believe it but indeed life will bring you through
what you need now is fresh air fresh air fresh air
from the height of what majestic calm do you proclaim these words of wisdom
i am a man with nothing to hope for that s all
a man perhaps of feeling and sympathy maybe of some knowledge too but my day is over
but you are a different matter there is life waiting for you
maybe your life too will pass off in smoke and come to nothing
come what does it matter that you will pass into another class of men
it s not comfort you regret with your heart
what of it that perhaps no one will see you for so long
it s not time but yourself that will decide that
be the sun and all will see you
the sun has before all to be the sun
i bet you re imagining that i am trying to get round you by flattery
perhaps you d better not believe my word perhaps you d better never believe it altogether i m made that way i confess it
but let me add you can judge for yourself i think how far i am a base sort of man and how far i am honest
well i can let you walk about another day or two
think it over my dear fellow and pray to god
it s more in your interest believe me
and what if i run away asked raskolnikov with a strange smile
a peasant would run away a fashionable dissenter would run away the flunkey of another man s thought for you ve only to show him the end of your little finger and he ll be ready to believe in anything for the rest of his life
but you ve ceased to believe in your theory already what will you run away with
and what would you do in hiding
it would be hateful and difficult for you and what you need more than anything in life is a definite position an atmosphere to suit you
and what sort of atmosphere would you have
if you ran away you d come back to yourself
and if i put you in prison say you ve been there a month or two or three remember my word you ll confess of yourself and perhaps to your own surprise
you won t know an hour beforehand that you are coming with a confession
i am convinced that you will decide to take your suffering
you don t believe my words now but you ll come to it of yourself
for suffering rodion romanovitch is a great thing
never mind my having grown fat i know all the same
don t laugh at it there s an idea in suffering nikolay is right
no you won t run away rodion romanovitch
raskolnikov got up and took his cap
the evening will be fine if only we don t have a storm
though it would be a good thing to freshen the air
porfiry petrovitch please don t take up the notion that i have confessed to you raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence
you re a strange man and i have listened to you from simple curiosity
but i have admitted nothing remember that
don t be uneasy my dear fellow have it your own way
walk about a bit you won t be able to walk too far
if anything happens i have one request to make of you he added dropping his voice
it s an awkward one but important
if anything were to happen though indeed i don t believe in it and think you quite incapable of it yet in case you were taken during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to the business in some other way in some fantastic fashion laying hands on yourself it s an absurd proposition but you must forgive me for it do leave a brief but precise note only two lines and mention the stone
good thoughts and sound decisions to you
porfiry went out stooping and avoiding looking at raskolnikov
the latter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he calculated that porfiry had reached the street and moved away
then he too went hurriedly out of the room
what he had to hope from that man he did not know
but that man had some hidden power over him
having once recognised this he could not rest and now the time had come
on the way one question particularly worried him had svidriga√Ølov been to porfiry s
as far as he could judge he would swear to it that he had not
he pondered again and again went over porfiry s visit no he hadn t been of course he hadn t
but if he had not been yet would he go
meanwhile for the present he fancied he couldn t
he could not have explained but if he could he would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment
it all worried him and at the same time he could not attend to it
strange to say none would have believed it perhaps but he only felt a faint vague anxiety about his immediate future
another much more important anxiety tormented him it concerned himself but in a different more vital way
moreover he was conscious of immense moral fatigue though his mind was working better that morning than it had done of late
and was it worth while after all that had happened to contend with these new trivial difficulties
was it worth while for instance to manoeuvre that svidriga√Ølov should not go to porfiry s
was it worth while to investigate to ascertain the facts to waste time over anyone like svidriga√Ølov
and yet he was hastening to svidriga√Ølov could he be expecting something from him information or means of escape
was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together
perhaps it was only fatigue despair perhaps it was not svidriga√Ølov but some other whom he needed and svidriga√Ølov had simply presented himself by chance
but what should he go to sonia for now
sonia stood before him as an irrevocable sentence
at that moment especially he did not feel equal to seeing her
no would it not be better to try svidriga√Ølov
and he could not help inwardly owning that he had long felt that he must see him for some reason
but what could they have in common
their very could not be of the same kind
the man moreover was very unpleasant evidently depraved undoubtedly cunning and deceitful possibly malignant
such stories were told about him
it is true he was befriending katerina ivanovna s children but who could tell with what motive and what it meant
the man always had some design some project
there was another thought which had been continually hovering of late about raskolnikov s mind and causing him great uneasiness
it was so painful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it
he sometimes thought that svidriga√Ølov was dogging his footsteps
svidriga√Ølov had found out his secret and had had designs on dounia
wasn t it practically certain that he had
and what if having learnt his secret and so having gained power over him he were to use it as a weapon against dounia
this idea sometimes even tormented his dreams but it had never presented itself so vividly to him as on his way to svidriga√Ølov
the very thought moved him to gloomy rage
to begin with this would transform everything even his own position he would have at once to confess his secret to dounia
would he have to give himself up perhaps to prevent dounia from taking some rash step
this morning dounia had received a letter
from whom could she get letters in petersburg
it s true razumihin was there to protect her but razumihin knew nothing of the position
perhaps it was his duty to tell razumihin
he thought of it with repugnance
in any case he must see svidriga√Ølov as soon as possible he decided finally
thank god the details of the interview were of little consequence if only he could get at the root of the matter but if svidriga√Ølov were capable if he were intriguing against dounia then raskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed through that month that he could only decide such questions in one way then i shall kill him he thought in cold despair
a sudden anguish oppressed his heart he stood still in the middle of the street and began looking about to see where he was and which way he was going
he found himself in x prospect thirty or forty paces from the hay market through which he had come
the whole second storey of the house on the left was used as a tavern
all the windows were wide open judging from the figures moving at the windows the rooms were full to overflowing
there were sounds of singing of clarionet and violin and the boom of a turkish drum
he was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the x prospect when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw svidriga√Ølov sitting at a right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth
raskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback almost terrified
svidriga√Ølov was silently watching and scrutinising him and what struck raskolnikov at once seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved
raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him but to be looking away while he watched him out of the corner of his eye
his heart was beating violently
yet it was evident that svidriga√Ølov did not want to be seen
he took the pipe out of his mouth and was on the point of concealing himself but as he got up and moved back his chair he seemed to have become suddenly aware that raskolnikov had seen him and was watching him
what had passed between them was much the same as what happened at their first meeting in raskolnikov s room
a sly smile came into svidriga√Ølov s face and grew broader and broader
each knew that he was seen and watched by the other
at last svidriga√Ølov broke into a loud laugh
well well come in if you want me i am here
raskolnikov went up into the tavern
he found svidriga√Ølov in a tiny back room adjoining the saloon in which merchants clerks and numbers of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the desperate bawling of a chorus of singers
the click of billiard balls could be heard in the distance
on the table before svidriga√Ølov stood an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne
in the room he found also a boy with a little hand organ a girl of eighteen wearing a striped skirt and a tyrolese hat with ribbons
in spite of the chorus in the other room she was singing some servants hall song in a rather husky contralto to the accompaniment of the organ
come that s enough svidriga√Ølov stopped her at raskolnikov s entrance
the girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully
she had sung her guttural rhymes too with a serious and respectful expression in her face
hey philip a glass shouted svidriga√Ølov
i won t drink anything said raskolnikov
as you like i didn t mean it for you
i don t want anything more you can go
he poured her out a full glass and laid down a yellow note
katia drank off her glass of wine as women do without putting it down in twenty gulps took the note and kissed svidriga√Ølov s hand which he allowed quite seriously
she went out of the room and the boy trailed after her with the organ
both had been brought in from the street
svidriga√Ølov had not been a week in petersburg but everything about him was already so to speak on a patriarchal footing the waiter philip was by now an old friend and very obsequious
the door leading to the saloon had a lock on it
svidriga√Ølov was at home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it
the tavern was dirty and wretched not even
i was going to see you and looking for you raskolnikov began but i don t know what made me turn from the hay market into the x prospect just now
i turn to the right from the hay market
i simply turned and here you are
why don t you say at once it s a miracle
oh that s the way with all you folk laughed svidriga√Ølov
you won t admit it even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle
here you say that it may be only chance
and what cowards they all are here about having an opinion of their own you can t fancy rodion romanovitch
i don t mean you you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to have it
that s how it was you attracted my curiosity
well that s enough you know svidriga√Ølov was obviously exhilarated but only slightly so he had not had more than half a glass of wine
i fancy you came to see me before you knew that i was capable of having what you call an opinion of my own observed raskolnikov
oh well it was a different matter
and apropos of the miracle let me tell you that i think you have been asleep for the last two or three days
i told you of this tavern myself there is no miracle in your coming straight here
i explained the way myself told you where it was and the hours you could find me here
i don t remember answered raskolnikov with surprise
the address has been stamped mechanically on your memory
you turned this way mechanically and yet precisely according to the direction though you are not aware of it
when i told you then i hardly hoped you understood me
you give yourself away too much rodion romanovitch
and another thing i m convinced there are lots of people in petersburg who talk to themselves as they walk
if only we had scientific men doctors lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable investigations in petersburg each in his own line
there are few places where there are so many gloomy strong and queer influences on the soul of man as in petersburg
the mere influences of climate mean so much
and it s the administrative centre of all russia and its character must be reflected on the whole country
but that is neither here nor there now
the point is that i have several times watched you
you walk out of your house holding your head high twenty paces from home you let it sink and fold your hands behind your back
you look and evidently see nothing before nor beside you
at last you begin moving your lips and talking to yourself and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim and at last stand still in the middle of the road
someone may be watching you besides me and it won t do you any good
it s nothing really to do with me and i can t cure you but of course you understand me
do you know that i am being followed asked raskolnikov looking inquisitively at him
no i know nothing about it said svidriga√Ølov seeming surprised
well then let us leave me alone raskolnikov muttered frowning
very good let us leave you alone
you had better tell me if you come here to drink and directed me twice to come here to you why did you hide and try to get away just now when i looked at the window from the street
and why was it you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and pretended to be asleep though you were wide awake while i stood in your doorway
and i may have had my reasons though you don t know them
raskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table leaned his chin in the fingers of his right hand and stared intently at svidriga√Ølov
for a full minute he scrutinised his face which had impressed him before
it was a strange face like a mask white and red with bright red lips with a flaxen beard and still thick flaxen hair
his eyes were somehow too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed
there was something awfully unpleasant in that handsome face which looked so wonderfully young for his age
svidriga√Ølov was smartly dressed in light summer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen
he wore a huge ring with a precious stone in it
have i got to bother myself about you too now said raskolnikov suddenly coming with nervous impatience straight to the point
even though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me i don t want to put myself out any more
i will show you at once that i don t prize myself as you probably think i do
i ve come to tell you at once that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has been discovered of late i will kill you before you get me locked up
and in the second place if you want to tell me anything for i keep fancying all this time that you have something to tell me make haste and tell it for time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late
why in such haste asked svidriga√Ølov looking at him curiously
everyone has his plans raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently
you urged me yourself to frankness just now and at the first question you refuse to answer svidriga√Ølov observed with a smile
you keep fancying that i have aims of my own and so you look at me with suspicion
of course it s perfectly natural in your position
but though i should like to be friends with you i shan t trouble myself to convince you of the contrary
the game isn t worth the candle
and i wasn t intending to talk to you about anything special
it was you who came hanging about me
why simply as an interesting subject for observation
i liked the fantastic nature of your position that s what it was
besides you are the brother of a person who greatly interested me and from that person i had in the past heard a very great deal about you from which i gathered that you had a great influence over her isn t that enough
still i must admit that your question is rather complex and is difficult for me to answer
here you for instance have come to me not only for a definite object but for the sake of hearing something new
isn t that so persisted svidriga√Ølov with a sly smile
well can t you fancy then that i too on my way here in the train was reckoning on you on your telling me something new and on my making some profit out of you
you see in what a tavern i spend all my time and it s my enjoyment that s to say it s no great enjoyment but one must sit somewhere that poor katia now you saw her
if only i had been a glutton now a club gourmand but you see i can eat this
he pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of a and potatoes lay on a tin dish
i ve had something and want nothing more
i don t drink for instance at all
except for champagne i never touch anything and not more than a glass of that all the evening and even that is enough to make my head ache
i ordered it just now to wind myself up for i am just going off somewhere and you see me in a peculiar state of mind
that was why i hid myself just now like a schoolboy for i was afraid you would hinder me
but i believe he pulled out his watch i can spend an hour with you
if only i d been something a landowner a father a cavalry officer a photographer a journalist
i am nothing no specialty and sometimes i am positively bored
i really thought you would tell me something new
but what are you and why have you come here
you know a gentleman i served for two years in the cavalry then i knocked about here in petersburg then i married marfa petrovna and lived in the country
didn t you get thrashed sometimes
why why you might have challenged them
altogether it must have been lively
i won t contradict you and besides i am no hand at philosophy
i confess that i hastened here for the sake of the women
as soon as you buried marfa petrovna quite so svidriga√Ølov smiled with engaging candour
you seem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women
you ask whether i find anything wrong in vice vice oh that s what you are after
but i ll answer you in order first about women in general you know i am fond of talking
tell me what should i restrain myself for
why should i give up women since i have a passion for them
so you hope for nothing here but vice
but anyway i like a direct question
in this vice at least there is something permanent founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy something present in the blood like an ember for ever setting one on fire and maybe not to be quickly extinguished even with years
you ll agree it s an occupation of a sort
that s nothing to rejoice at it s a disease and a dangerous one
i agree that it is a disease like everything that exceeds moderation
and of course in this one must exceed moderation
but in the first place everybody does so in one way or another and in the second place of course one ought to be moderate and prudent however mean it may be but what am i to do
if i hadn t this i might have to shoot myself
i am ready to admit that a decent man ought to put up with being bored but yet
svidriga√Ølov parried with disgust
please don t speak of it he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown in all the previous conversation
i admit it s an unpardonable weakness but i can t help it
i am afraid of death and i dislike its being talked of
do you know that i am to a certain extent a mystic
ah the apparitions of marfa petrovna
do they still go on visiting you
oh don t talk of them there have been no more in petersburg confound them
he cried with an air of irritation
let s rather talk of that though
i have not much time and can t stay long with you it s a pity
i should have found plenty to tell you
no that s not what i want to talk of
and the hideousness the filthiness of all your surroundings doesn t that affect you
have you lost the strength to stop yourself
and do you pretend to strength too
you surprised me just now rodion romanovitch though i knew beforehand it would be so
you preach to me about vice and √¶sthetics
of course that s all as it should be and it would be surprising if it were not so yet it is strange in reality
ah what a pity i have no time for you re a most interesting type
but what a braggart you are raskolnikov said with some disgust
upon my word i am not answered svidriga√Ølov laughing
however i won t dispute it let me be a braggart why not brag if it hurts no one
i spent seven years in the country with marfa petrovna so now when i come across an intelligent person like you intelligent and highly interesting i am simply glad to talk and besides i ve drunk that of champagne and it s gone to my head a little
and besides there s a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously but about that i will keep quiet
raskolnikov had begun getting up
he felt oppressed and stifled and as it were ill at ease at having come here
he felt convinced that svidriga√Ølov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth
let them bring you some tea anyway
stay a little i won t talk nonsense about myself i mean
if you like i ll tell you how a woman tried to save me as you would call it
it will be an answer to your first question indeed for the woman was your sister
besides even in a worthless low fellow like me avdotya romanovna can only excite the deepest respect
chapter iv you know perhaps yes i told you myself began svidriga√Ølov that i was in the debtors prison here for an immense sum and had not any expectation of being able to pay it
there s no need to go into particulars how marfa petrovna bought me out do you know to what a point of insanity a woman can sometimes love
she was an honest woman and very sensible although completely uneducated
would you believe that this honest and jealous woman after many scenes of hysterics and reproaches condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which she kept throughout our married life
she was considerably older than i and besides she always kept a clove or something in her mouth
there was so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too of a sort as to tell her straight out that i couldn t be absolutely faithful to her
this confession drove her to frenzy but yet she seems in a way to have liked my brutal frankness
she thought it showed i was unwilling to deceive her if i warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous woman you know that s the first consideration
after many tears an unwritten contract was drawn up between us first that i would never leave marfa petrovna and would always be her husband secondly that i would never absent myself without her permission thirdly that i would never set up a permanent mistress fourthly in return for this marfa petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants but only with her secret knowledge fifthly god forbid my falling in love with a woman of our class sixthly in case i which god forbid should be visited by a great serious passion i was bound to reveal it to marfa petrovna
on this last score however marfa petrovna was fairly at ease
she was a sensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute profligate incapable of real love
but a sensible woman and a jealous woman are two very different things and that s where the trouble came in
but to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people about us
i have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than in anyone s
perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was ridiculous and absurd about marfa petrovna
she certainly had some very ridiculous ways but i tell you frankly that i feel really sorry for the innumerable woes of which i was the cause
well and that s enough i think by way of a decorous for the most tender wife of a most tender husband
when we quarrelled i usually held my tongue and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to attain its object it influenced her it pleased her indeed
these were times when she was positively proud of me
but your sister she couldn t put up with anyway
and however she came to risk taking such a beautiful creature into her house as a governess
my explanation is that marfa petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell in love herself literally fell in love with your sister
well little wonder look at avdotya romanovna
i saw the danger at the first glance and what do you think i resolved not to look at her even
but avdotya romanovna herself made the first step would you believe it
would you believe it too that marfa petrovna was positively angry with me at first for my persistent silence about your sister for my careless reception of her continual adoring praises of avdotya romanovna
i don t know what it was she wanted
well of course marfa petrovna told avdotya romanovna every detail about me
she had the unfortunate habit of telling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually complaining of me how could she fail to confide in such a delightful new friend
i expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt avdotya romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were current about me
i don t mind betting that you too have heard something of the sort already
luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child
is that true don t refer to those vulgar tales i beg said svidriga√Ølov with disgust and annoyance
if you insist on wanting to know about all that idiocy i will tell you one day but now
i was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you treated badly
i beg you to drop the subject svidriga√Ølov interrupted again with obvious impatience
was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe
raskolnikov felt more and more irritated
svidriga√Ølov looked at him attentively and raskolnikov fancied he caught a flash of spiteful mockery in that look
but svidriga√Ølov restrained himself and answered very civilly
i see that you too are extremely interested and shall feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity
i see that i really might pass for a romantic figure with some people
judge how grateful i must be to marfa petrovna for having repeated to avdotya romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip about me
i dare not guess what impression it made on her but in any case it worked in my interests
with all avdotya romanovna s natural aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect she did at least feel pity for me pity for a lost soul
and if once a girl s heart is moved to it s more dangerous than anything
she is bound to want to save him to bring him to his senses and lift him up and draw him to nobler aims and restore him to new life and usefulness well we all know how far such dreams can go
i saw at once that the bird was flying into the cage of herself
i think you are frowning rodion romanovitch
as you know it all ended in smoke
hang it all what a lot i am drinking
do you know i always from the very beginning regretted that it wasn t your sister s fate to be born in the second or third century as the daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or in asia minor
she would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot pincers
and she would have gone to it of herself
and in the fourth or fifth century she would have walked away into the egyptian desert and would have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and visions
she is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone and if she can t get her torture she ll throw herself out of a window
i ve heard something of a razumihin he s said to be a sensible fellow his surname suggests it indeed
he s probably a divinity student
well he d better look after your sister
i believe i understand her and i am proud of it
but at the beginning of an acquaintance as you know one is apt to be more heedless and stupid
hang it all why is she so handsome
in fact it began on my side with a most irresistible physical desire
avdotya romanovna is awfully chaste incredibly and phenomenally so
take note i tell you this about your sister as a fact
she is almost morbidly chaste in spite of her broad intelligence and it will stand in her way
there happened to be a girl in the house then parasha a wench whom i had never seen before she had just come from another village very pretty but incredibly stupid she burst into tears wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal
one day after dinner avdotya romanovna followed me into an avenue in the garden and with flashing eyes on my leaving poor parasha alone
it was almost our first conversation by ourselves
i of course was only too pleased to obey her wishes tried to appear disconcerted embarrassed in fact played my part not badly
then came interviews mysterious conversations exhortations entreaties supplications even tears would you believe it even tears
think what the passion for propaganda will bring some girls to
i of course threw it all on my destiny posed as hungering and thirsting for light and finally resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the female heart a weapon which never fails one
nothing in the world is harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery
if there s the hundredth part of a false note in speaking the truth it leads to a discord and that leads to trouble
but if all to the last note is false in flattery it is just as agreeable and is heard not without satisfaction
it may be a coarse satisfaction but still a satisfaction
and however coarse the flattery at least half will be sure to seem true
that s so for all stages of development and classes of society
a vestal virgin might be seduced by flattery
i can never remember without laughter how i once seduced a lady who was devoted to her husband her children and her principles
what fun it was and how little trouble
and the lady really had principles of her own anyway
all my tactics lay in simply being utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity
i flattered her shamelessly and as soon as i succeeded in getting a pressure of the hand even a glance from her i would reproach myself for having snatched it by force and would declare that she had resisted so that i could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled
i maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my treachery and yielded to me unconsciously unawares and so on
in fact i triumphed while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was innocent chaste and faithful to all her duties and obligations and had succumbed quite by accident
and how angry she was with me when i explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was just as eager as i poor marfa petrovna was awfully weak on the side of flattery and if i had only cared to i might have had all her property settled on me during her lifetime
i am drinking an awful lot of wine now and talking too much
i hope you won t be angry if i mention now that i was beginning to produce the same effect on avdotya romanovna
but i was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all
avdotya romanovna had several times and one time in particular been greatly displeased by the expression of my eyes would you believe it
there was sometimes a light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and more unguarded till it was hateful to her
no need to go into detail but we parted
i fell to jeering in the coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me parasha came on to the scene again and not she alone in fact there was a tremendous
ah rodion romanovitch if you could only see how your sister s eyes can flash sometimes
never mind my being drunk at this moment and having had a whole glass of wine
i assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams the very rustle of her dress was more than i could stand at last
i really began to think that i might become epileptic
i could never have believed that i could be moved to such a frenzy
it was essential indeed to be reconciled but by then it was impossible
to what a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy
never undertake anything in a frenzy rodion romanovitch
i reflected that avdotya romanovna was after all a beggar ach excuse me that s not the word but does it matter if it expresses the meaning that she lived by her work that she had her mother and you to keep ach hang it you are frowning again and i resolved to offer her all my money thirty thousand roubles i could have realised then if she would run away with me here to petersburg
of course i should have vowed eternal love rapture and so on
do you know i was so wild about her at that time that if she had told me to poison marfa petrovna or to cut her throat and to marry herself it would have been done at once
but it ended in the catastrophe of which you know already
you can fancy how frantic i was when i heard that marfa petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly attorney luzhin and had almost made a match between them which would really have been just the same thing as i was proposing
i notice that you ve begun to be very attentive
svidriga√Ølov struck the table with his fist impatiently
raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne that he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him and he resolved to take advantage of the opportunity
he felt very suspicious of svidriga√Ølov
well after what you have said i am fully convinced that you have come to petersburg with designs on my sister he said directly to svidriga√Ølov in order to irritate him further
oh nonsense said svidriga√Ølov seeming to rouse himself
why i told you besides your sister can t endure me
yes i am certain that she can t but that s not the point
svidriga√Ølov screwed up his eyes and smiled mockingly
you are right she doesn t love me but you can never be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and mistress
there s always a little corner which remains a secret to the world and is only known to those two
will you answer for it that avdotya romanovna regarded me with aversion
from some words you ve dropped i notice that you still have designs and of course evil ones on dounia and mean to carry them out promptly
what have i dropped words like that
svidriga√Ølov asked in na√Øve dismay taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his designs
why you are dropping them even now
you have rather to be afraid of me
but what nonsense i ve drunk too much though i see that
i was almost saying too much again
he snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of the window
that s all nonsense said svidriga√Ølov wetting a towel and putting it to his head
but i can answer you in one word and annihilate all your suspicions
do you know that i am going to get married
but i couldn t have told you so for certain for i had not even seen my betrothed i only meant to
but now i really have a betrothed and it s a settled thing and if it weren t that i have business that can t be put off i would have taken you to see them at once for i should like to ask your advice
ach hang it only ten minutes left
but i must tell you for it s an interesting story my marriage in its own way
i ll take you there i ll show you my betrothed only not now
you have to go to the right and i to the left
do you know that madame resslich the woman i am lodging with now eh
i know what you re thinking that she s the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter
you re bored she said you want something to fill up your time
for you know i am a gloomy depressed person
i do no harm but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a time
and that resslich is a sly hussy i tell you
i know what she has got in her mind she thinks i shall get sick of it abandon my wife and depart and she ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her in our class of course or higher
she told me the father was a retired official who has been sitting in a chair for the last three years with his legs paralysed
the mamma she said was a sensible woman
there is a son serving in the provinces but he doesn t help there is a daughter who is married but she doesn t visit them
and they ve two little nephews on their hands as though their own children were not enough and they ve taken from school their youngest daughter a girl who ll be sixteen in another month so that then she can be married
i present myself a landowner a widower of a name with connections with a fortune
you should have seen how i talked to the papa and mamma
it was worth paying to have seen me at that moment
she comes in curtseys you can fancy still in a short frock an unopened bud
flushing like a sunset she had been told no doubt
i don t know how you feel about female faces but to my mind these sixteen years these childish eyes shyness and tears of bashfulness are better than beauty and she is a perfect little picture too
fair hair in little curls like a lamb s full little rosy lips tiny feet a charmer
i told them i was in a hurry owing to domestic circumstances and the next day that is the day before yesterday we were betrothed
when i go now i take her on my knee at once and keep her there
well she flushes like a sunset and i kiss her every minute
her mamma of course impresses on her that this is her husband and that this must be so
the present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage
here you have what is called nature et la
i ve talked to her twice she is far from a fool
sometimes she steals a look at me that positively scorches me
her face is like raphael s madonna
you know the sistine madonna s face has something fantastic in it the face of mournful religious ecstasy
well she s something in that line
the day after we d been betrothed i bought her presents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles a set of diamonds and another of pearls and a silver as large as this with all sorts of things in it so that even my madonna s face glowed
i sat her on my knee yesterday and i suppose rather too unceremoniously she flushed crimson and the tears started but she didn t want to show it
we were left alone she suddenly flung herself on my neck for the first time of her own accord put her little arms round me kissed me and vowed that she would be an obedient faithful and good wife would make me happy would devote all her life every minute of her life would sacrifice everything everything and that all she asks in return is my and that she wants nothing nothing more from me no presents
you ll admit that to hear such a confession alone from an angel of sixteen in a muslin frock with little curls with a flush of maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is rather fascinating
well listen we ll go to see my betrothed only not just now
the fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites your sensuality
will you really make such a marriage
everyone thinks of himself and he lives most gaily who knows best how to deceive himself
but why are you so keen about virtue
have mercy on me my good friend
but you have provided for the children of katerina ivanovna
though though you had your own reasons
i am always fond of children very fond of them laughed svidriga√Ølov
i can tell you one curious instance of it
the first day i came here i visited various haunts after seven years i simply rushed at them
you probably notice that i am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my old friends
i shall do without them as long as i can
do you know when i was with marfa petrovna in the country i was haunted by the thought of these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a great deal
the peasants have vodka the educated young people shut out from activity waste themselves in impossible dreams and visions and are crippled by theories jews have sprung up and are amassing money and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery
from the first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours
i chanced to be in a frightful den i like my dens dirty it was a dance so called and there was a such as i never saw in my day
all of a sudden i saw a little girl of thirteen nicely dressed dancing with a specialist in that line with another one
her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall
you can t fancy what a that was
the girl was ashamed blushed at last felt insulted and began to cry
her partner seized her and began whirling her round and performing before her everyone laughed and i like your public even the
public they laughed and shouted serves her right serves her right
well it s not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or not
i at once fixed on my plan sat down by the mother and began by saying that i too was a stranger and that people here were and that they couldn t distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect gave her to understand that i had plenty of money offered to take them home in my carriage
i took them home and got to know them
they were lodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the country
she told me that she and her daughter could only regard my acquaintance as an honour
i found out that they had nothing of their own and had come to town upon some legal business
i proffered my services and money
i learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon by mistake believing that it was a genuine dancing class
i offered to assist in the young girl s education in french and dancing
my offer was accepted with enthusiasm as an honour and we are still friendly
if you like we ll go and see them only not just now
enough of your vile nasty anecdotes depraved vile sensual man
schiller you are a regular schiller
but you know i shall tell you these things on purpose for the pleasure of hearing your outcries
i can see i am ridiculous myself muttered raskolnikov angrily
svidriga√Ølov laughed heartily finally he called philip paid his bill and began getting up
i should rather think it must be a pleasure
no doubt it is a pleasure for a profligate to describe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort in his mind especially under such circumstances and to such a man as me
well if you come to that svidriga√Ølov answered scrutinising raskolnikov with some surprise if you come to that you are a thorough cynic yourself
you ve plenty to make you so anyway
you can understand a great deal and you can do a great deal too
i sincerely regret not having had more talk with you but i shan t lose sight of you
svidriga√Ølov walked out of the restaurant
raskolnikov walked out after him
svidriga√Ølov was not however very drunk the wine had affected him for a moment but it was passing off every minute
he was preoccupied with something of importance and was frowning
he was apparently excited and uneasy in anticipation of something
his manner to raskolnikov had changed during the last few minutes and he was ruder and more sneering every moment
raskolnikov noticed all this and he too was uneasy
he became very suspicious of svidriga√Ølov and resolved to follow him
they came out on to the pavement
you go to the right and i to the left or if you like the other way
and he walked to the right towards the hay market
chapter v raskolnikov walked after him
what s this cried svidriga√Ølov turning round i thought i said
it means that i am not going to lose sight of you now
both stood still and gazed at one another as though measuring their strength
from all your half tipsy stories raskolnikov observed harshly i am that you have not given up your designs on my sister but are pursuing them more actively than ever
i have learnt that my sister received a letter this morning
you have hardly been able to sit still all this time
you may have unearthed a wife on the way but that means nothing
i should like to make certain myself
raskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he wished to make certain
again they stood for a minute facing each other
at last svidriga√Ølov s face changed
having satisfied himself that raskolnikov was not frightened at his threat he assumed a mirthful and friendly air
i purposely refrained from referring to your affair though i am devoured by curiosity
i ve put it off till another time but you re enough to rouse the dead
well let us go only i warn you beforehand i am only going home for a moment to get some money then i shall lock up the flat take a cab and go to spend the evening at the islands
now now are you going to follow me
i m coming to your lodgings not to see you but sofya semyonovna to say i m sorry not to have been at the funeral
that s as you like but sofya semyonovna is not at home
she has taken the three children to an old lady of high rank the patroness of some orphan asylums whom i used to know years ago
i charmed the old lady by depositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three children of katerina ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well
i told her too the story of sofya semyonovna in full detail suppressing nothing
it produced an indescribable effect on her
that s why sofya semyonovna has been invited to call at the x hotel where the lady is staying for the time
no matter i ll come all the same
as you like it s nothing to me but i won t come with you here we are at home
by the way i am convinced that you regard me with suspicion just because i have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled you with questions
it struck you as extraordinary i don t mind betting it s that
well it teaches one to show delicacy
yes i should have been surprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened
though i did understand something of the pranks you had been up to and were telling sofya semyonovna about what was the meaning of it
perhaps i am quite behind the times and can t understand
for goodness sake explain it my dear boy
you couldn t have heard anything
but i m not talking about that though i did hear something
no i m talking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now
the schiller in you is in revolt every moment and now you tell me not to listen at doors
if that s how you feel go and inform the police that you had this mischance you made a little mistake in your theory
but if you are convinced that one mustn t listen at doors but one may murder old women at one s pleasure you d better be off to america and make haste
i m not thinking of that at all raskolnikov interrupted with disgust
i understand but don t put yourself out don t discuss it if you don t want to
i understand the questions you are worrying over moral ones aren t they
you ll say you are still a man and a citizen
if so you ought not to have got into this coil
it s no use taking up a job you are not fit for
well you d better shoot yourself or don t you want to
you seem trying to enrage me to make me leave you
you see that s the way to sofya semyonovna
here is madame de kapernaumov herself
she is not in and won t be till late in the evening probably
well come to my room you wanted to come and see me didn t you
she is a woman who is always busy an excellent woman i assure you
she might have been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible
i take this bond out of the bureau see what a lot i ve got of them still this one will be turned into cash
the bureau is locked the flat is locked and here we are again on the stairs
i believe it will come on to rain
never mind we ll put down the hood
svidriga√Ølov was already in the carriage
raskolnikov decided that his suspicions were at least for that moment unjust
without answering a word he turned and walked back towards the hay market
if he had only turned round on his way he might have seen svidriga√Ølov get out not a hundred paces off dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement
but he had turned the corner and could see nothing
intense disgust drew him away from svidriga√Ølov
to think that i could for one instant have looked for help from that coarse brute that depraved sensualist and blackguard
raskolnikov s judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily there was something about svidriga√Ølov which gave him a certain original even a mysterious character
as concerned his sister raskolnikov was convinced that svidriga√Ølov would not leave her in peace
but it was too tiresome and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this
when he was alone he had not gone twenty paces before he sank as usual into deep thought
on the bridge he stood by the railing and began gazing at the water
and his sister was standing close by him
he met her at the entrance to the bridge but passed by without seeing her
dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was struck with dismay
she stood still and did not know whether to call to him or not
suddenly she saw svidriga√Ølov coming quickly from the direction of the hay market
he seemed to be approaching cautiously
he did not go on to the bridge but stood aside on the pavement doing all he could to avoid raskolnikov s seeing him
he had observed dounia for some time and had been making signs to her
she fancied he was signalling to beg her not to speak to her brother but to come to him
she stole by her brother and went up to svidriga√Ølov
let us make haste away svidriga√Ølov whispered to her i don t want rodion romanovitch to know of our meeting
i must tell you i ve been sitting with him in the restaurant close by where he looked me up and i had great difficulty in getting rid of him
he has somehow heard of my letter to you and suspects something
it wasn t you who told him of course but if not you who then
well we ve turned the corner now dounia interrupted and my brother won t see us
i have to tell you that i am going no further with you
you can tell it all in the street
in the first place i can t say it in the street secondly you must hear sofya semyonovna too and thirdly i will show you some papers
oh well if you won t agree to come with me i shall refuse to give any explanation and go away at once
but i beg you not to forget that a very curious secret of your beloved brother s is entirely in my keeping
dounia stood still hesitating and looked at svidriga√Ølov with searching eyes
and even in the country you did me more harm than i did you
have you prepared sofya semyonovna
no i have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she is at home now
she has buried her stepmother she is not likely to go visiting on such a day
for the time i don t want to speak to anyone about it
and i half regret having spoken to you
the slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like this
i live there in that house we are coming to it
that s the porter of our house he knows me very well you see he s bowing he sees i m coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious
excuse my putting things so coarsely
i haven t a flat to myself sofya semyonovna s room is next to mine she lodges in the next flat
the whole floor is let out in lodgings
why are you frightened like a child
svidriga√Ølov s lips were twisted in a condescending smile but he was in no smiling mood
his heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe
he spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement
but dounia did not notice this peculiar excitement she was so irritated by his remark that she was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to her
though i know that you are not a man of honour i am not in the least afraid of you
lead the way she said with apparent composure but her face was very pale
svidriga√Ølov stopped at sonia s room
allow me to inquire whether she is at home
but i know she may come quite soon
if she s gone out it can only be to see a lady about the orphans
i ve been meddling and making arrangements for them
if sofya semyonovna does not come back in ten minutes i will send her to you if you like
madame resslich my landlady has the next room
i will show you my chief piece of evidence this door from my bedroom leads into two perfectly empty rooms which are to let
you must look into them with some attention
svidriga√Ølov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms
dounia was looking about her mistrustfully but saw nothing special in the furniture or position of the rooms
yet there was something to observe for instance that svidriga√Ølov s flat was exactly between two sets of almost uninhabited apartments
his rooms were not entered directly from the passage but through the landlady s two almost empty rooms
unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom svidriga√Ølov showed dounia the two empty rooms that were to let
dounia stopped in the doorway not knowing what she was called to look upon but svidriga√Ølov hastened to explain
look here at this second large room
by the door stands a chair the only one in the two rooms
i brought it from my rooms so as to listen more conveniently
just the other side of the door is sofya semyonovna s table she sat there talking to rodion romanovitch
and i sat here listening on two successive evenings for two hours each time and of course i was able to learn something what do you think
now come back to my room we can t sit down here
he brought avdotya romanovna back into his and offered her a chair
he sat down at the opposite side of the table at least seven feet from her but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which had once frightened dounia so much
she shuddered and once more looked about her distrustfully
it was an involuntary gesture she evidently did not wish to betray her uneasiness
but the secluded position of svidriga√Ølov s lodging had suddenly struck her
she wanted to ask whether his landlady at least were at home but pride kept her from asking
moreover she had another trouble in her heart incomparably greater than fear for herself
here is your letter she said laying it on the table
you hint at a crime committed you say by my brother
you hint at it too clearly you daren t deny it now
i must tell you that i d heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don t believe a word of it
it s a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion
i know the story and why and how it was invented
but let me warn you that i don t believe you
dounia said this speaking hurriedly and for an instant the colour rushed to her face
if you didn t believe it how could you risk coming alone to my rooms
simply from curiosity don t torment me
there s no denying that you are a brave girl
upon my word i thought you would have asked razumihin to escort you here
but he was not with you nor anywhere near
it s spirited of you it proves you wanted to spare rodion romanovitch
but everything is divine in you
about your brother what am i to say to you
surely that s not the only thing you are building on no not on that but on his own words
he came here on two successive evenings to see sofya semyonovna
he made a full confession to her
he killed an old woman a pawnbroker with whom he had pawned things himself
he killed her sister too a pedlar woman called lizaveta who happened to come in while he was murdering her sister
he killed them with an axe he brought with him
he murdered them to rob them and he did rob them
he took money and various things
he told all this word for word to sofya semyonovna the only person who knows his secret
but she has had no share by word or deed in the murder she was as horrified at it as you are now
don t be anxious she won t betray him
it can not be muttered dounia with white lips
there was not the slightest cause no sort of ground
he robbed her that was the cause he took money and things
it s true that by his own admission he made no use of the money or things but hid them under a stone where they are now
but that was because he dared not make use of them
how could he dream of it cried dounia and she jumped up from the chair
why you know him and you ve seen him can he be a thief
she seemed to be imploring svidriga√Ølov she had entirely forgotten her fear
there are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities avdotya romanovna
a thief steals and knows he is a scoundrel but i ve heard of a gentleman who broke open the mail
who knows very likely he thought he was doing a gentlemanly thing
of course i should not have believed it myself if i d been told of it as you have but i believe my own ears
he explained all the causes of it to sofya semyonovna too but she did not believe her ears at first yet she believed her own eyes at last
it s a long story avdotya romanovna
how shall i tell you a theory of a sort the same one by which i for instance consider that a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right a solitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds
it s galling too of course for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if he had for instance a paltry three thousand his whole career his whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three thousand
add to that nervous irritability from hunger from lodging in a hole from rags from a vivid sense of the charm of his social position and his sister s and mother s position too
above all vanity pride and vanity though goodness knows he may have good qualities too
i am not blaming him please don t think it besides it s not my business
a special little theory came in too a theory of a sort dividing mankind you see into material and superior persons that is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their superiority who make laws for the rest of mankind the material that is
it s all right as a theory th√©orie comme une
napoleon attracted him tremendously that is what affected him was that a great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing but have overstepped the law without thinking about it
he seems to have fancied that he was a genius too that is he was convinced of it for a time
he has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he could make a theory but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law and so he is not a man of genius
and that s humiliating for a young man of any pride in our day especially
you deny him any moral feeling then
ah avdotya romanovna everything is in a muddle now not that it was ever in very good order
russians in general are broad in their ideas avdotya romanovna broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to the fantastic the chaotic
but it s a misfortune to be broad without a special genius
do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on this subject sitting in the evenings on the terrace after supper
why you used to reproach me with breadth
who knows perhaps we were talking at the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan
there are no sacred traditions amongst us especially in the educated class avdotya romanovna
at the best someone will make them up somehow for himself out of books or from some old chronicle
but those are for the most part the learned and all old fogeys so that it would be almost in a man of society
you know my opinions in general though
i do nothing at all i persevere in that
but we ve talked of this more than once before
i was so happy indeed as to interest you in my opinions
you are very pale avdotya romanovna
i read that article of his about men to whom all is permitted
but where are you going avdotya romanovna
i want to see sofya semyonovna dounia articulated faintly
avdotya romanovna could not finish
her breath literally failed her
sofya semyonovna will not be back till night at least i believe not
she was to have been back at once but if not then she will not be in till quite late
you were lying lying all the time
cried dounia completely losing her head
almost fainting she sank on to a chair which svidriga√Ølov made haste to give her
he sprinkled some water over her
dounia shuddered and came to herself
it has acted violently svidriga√Ølov muttered to himself frowning
avdotya romanovna calm yourself
would you like me to take him abroad
i have money i can get a ticket in three days
and as for the murder he will do all sorts of good deeds yet to atone for it
we came in at that door and now it is locked
we couldn t be shouting all over the flat on such a subject
i am far from jeering it s simply that i m sick of talking like this
but how can you go in such a state
you will drive him to fury and he will give himself up
let me tell you he is already being watched they are already on his track
you will simply be giving him away
wait a little i saw him and was talking to him just now
wait a bit sit down let us think it over together
i asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to consider it thoroughly
svidriga√Ølov sat down beside her
it all depends on you on you on you alone he began with glowing eyes almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for emotion
dounia drew back from him in alarm
you one word from you and he is saved
i ll get a passport two passports one for him and one for me
if you like i ll take a passport for you for your mother
what do you want with razumihin
let me kiss the hem of your dress let me let me
the very rustle of it is too much for me
what you believe i will believe
don t don t look at me like that
do you know that you are killing me
he was almost beginning to rave
something seemed suddenly to go to his head
dounia jumped up and rushed to the door
svidriga√Ølov got up and came to himself
his still trembling lips slowly broke into an angry mocking smile
there is no one at home he said quietly and emphatically
the landlady has gone out and it s waste of time to shout like that
you are only exciting yourself uselessly
open the door at once at once base man
i have lost the key and can not find it
this is an outrage cried dounia turning pale as death
she rushed to the furthest corner where she made haste to barricade herself with a little table
she did not scream but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched every movement he made
svidriga√Ølov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her
he was positively composed at least in appearance but his face was pale as before
the mocking smile did not leave his face
you spoke of outrage just now avdotya romanovna
in that case you may be sure i ve taken measures
sofya semyonovna is not at home
the kapernaumovs are far away there are five locked rooms between
i am at least twice as strong as you are and i have nothing to fear besides
for you could not complain afterwards
you surely would not be willing actually to betray your brother
besides no one would believe you
how should a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings
so that even if you do sacrifice your brother you could prove nothing
it is very difficult to prove an assault avdotya romanovna
scoundrel whispered dounia indignantly
as you like but observe i was only speaking by way of a general proposition
it s my personal conviction that you are perfectly right violence is hateful
i only spoke to show you that you need have no remorse even if you were willing to save your brother of your own accord as i suggest to you
you would be simply submitting to circumstances to violence in fact if we must use that word
your brother s and your mother s fate are in your hands
i will be your slave all my life
svidriga√Ølov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from dounia
she had not the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination
suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver cocked it and laid it in her hand on the table
he cried surprised but smiling maliciously
well that completely alters the aspect of affairs
you ve made things wonderfully easier for me avdotya romanovna
but where did you get the revolver
why it s my revolver an old friend
the shooting lessons i ve given you in the country have not been thrown away
it s not your revolver it belonged to marfa petrovna whom you killed wretch
there was nothing of yours in her house
i took it when i began to suspect what you were capable of
if you dare to advance one step i swear i ll kill you
i ask from curiosity said svidriga√Ølov still standing where he was
you poisoned your wife i know you are a murderer yourself
are you so positive i poisoned marfa petrovna
you hinted it yourself you talked to me of poison
even if that were true it would have been for your sake you would have been the cause
you seem to have forgotten how you softened to me in the heat of propaganda
do you remember that moonlight night when the nightingale was singing
that s a lie there was a flash of fury in dounia s eyes that s a lie and a libel
women ought not to be reminded of such things he smiled
i know you will shoot you pretty wild creature
dounia raised the revolver and deadly pale gazed at him measuring the distance and awaiting the first movement on his part
her lower lip was white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire
he had never seen her so handsome
the fire glowing in her eyes at the moment she raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of anguish in his heart
he took a step forward and a shot rang out
the bullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind
he stood still and laughed softly
he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood which flowed in a thin stream down his right temple
the bullet seemed to have just grazed the skin
dounia lowered the revolver and looked at svidriga√Ølov not so much in terror as in a sort of wild amazement
she seemed not to understand what she was doing and what was going on
fire again i ll wait said svidriga√Ølov softly still smiling but gloomily
if you go on like that i shall have time to seize you before you cock again
dounia started quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it
well at three paces you can hardly help it
his eyes flashed and he took two steps forward
dounia shot again it missed fire
never mind you have another charge there
he stood facing her two paces away waiting and gazing at her with wild determination with feverishly passionate stubborn set eyes
dounia saw that he would sooner die than let her go
and now of course she would kill him at two paces
suddenly she flung away the revolver
said svidriga√Ølov with surprise and he drew a deep breath
a weight seemed to have rolled from his heart perhaps not only the fear of death indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment
it was the deliverance from another feeling darker and more bitter which he could not himself have defined
he went to dounia and gently put his arm round her waist
she did not resist but trembling like a leaf looked at him with suppliant eyes
he tried to say something but his lips moved without being able to utter a sound
her voice now was quite different
there followed a moment of terrible dumb struggle in the heart of svidriga√Ølov
he looked at her with an indescribable gaze
suddenly he withdrew his arm turned quickly to the window and stood facing it
he took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table behind him without turning or looking at dounia
he looked stubbornly out of the window
dounia went up to the table to take the key
repeated svidriga√Ølov still without turning or moving
but there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that make haste
dounia understood it snatched up the key flew to the door unlocked it quickly and rushed out of the room
a minute later beside herself she ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of bridge
svidriga√Ølov remained three minutes standing at the window
at last he slowly turned looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead
a strange smile contorted his face a pitiful sad weak smile a smile of despair
the blood which was already getting dry smeared his hand
he looked angrily at it then wetted a towel and washed his temple
the revolver which dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly caught his eye
he picked it up and examined it
it was a little pocket revolver of construction
there were still two charges and one capsule left in it
he thought a little put the revolver in his pocket took his hat and went out
chapter vi he spent that evening till ten o clock going from one low haunt to another
katia too turned up and sang another gutter song how a certain villain and tyrant began kissing katia
svidriga√Ølov treated katia and the and some singers and the waiters and two little clerks
he was particularly drawn to these clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses one bent to the left and the other to the right
they took him finally to a pleasure garden where he paid for their entrance
there was one lanky and three bushes in the garden besides a vauxhall which was in reality a where tea too was served and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it
a chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed german clown from munich with a red nose entertained the public
the clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent
svidriga√Ølov was chosen to decide the dispute
he listened to them for a quarter of an hour but they shouted so loud that there was no possibility of understanding them
the only fact that seemed certain was that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in selling it on the spot to a jew but would not share the spoil with his companion
finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon belonging to the vauxhall
it was missed and the affair began to seem troublesome
svidriga√Ølov paid for the spoon got up and walked out of the garden
he had not drunk a drop of wine all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than anything
it was a dark and stifling evening
threatening came over the sky about ten o clock
there was a clap of thunder and the rain came down like a waterfall
the water fell not in drops but beat on the earth in streams
there were flashes of lightning every minute and each flash lasted while one could count five
drenched to the skin he went home locked himself in opened the bureau took out all his money and tore up two or three papers
then putting the money in his pocket he was about to change his clothes but looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the rain he gave up the idea took up his hat and went out of the room without locking the door
she was not alone the four kapernaumov children were with her
she received svidriga√Ølov in respectful silence looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes
the children all ran away at once in indescribable terror
svidriga√Ølov sat down at the table and asked sonia to sit beside him
i may be going to america sofya semyonovna said svidriga√Ølov and as i am probably seeing you for the last time i have come to make some arrangements
i know what she said to you you need not tell me
sonia made a movement and blushed
those people have their own way of doing things
as to your sisters and your brother they are really provided for and the money assigned to them i ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments
you had better take charge of the receipts in case anything happens
here are three bonds to the value of three thousand roubles
take those for yourself entirely for yourself and let that be strictly between ourselves so that no one knows of it whatever you hear
you will need the money for to go on living in the old way sofya semyonovna is bad and besides there is no need for it now
i am so much indebted to you and so are the children and my stepmother said sonia hurriedly and if i ve said so little please don t consider
but as for the money arkady ivanovitch i am very grateful to you but i don t need it now
i can always earn my own living
if you are so charitable that money it s for you for you sofya semyonovna and please don t waste words over it
rodion romanovitch has two alternatives a bullet in the brain or siberia
sonia looked wildly at him and started
don t be uneasy i know all about it from himself and i am not a gossip i won t tell anyone
it was good advice when you told him to give himself up and confess
it would be much better for him
well if it turns out to be siberia he will go and you will follow him
you ll need it for him do you understand
giving it to you is the same as my giving it to him
besides you promised amalia ivanovna to pay what s owing
how can you undertake such obligations so heedlessly sofya semyonovna
it was katerina ivanovna s debt and not yours so you ought not to have taken any notice of the german woman
you can t get through the world like that
if you are ever questioned about me or the day after you will be asked don t say anything about my coming to see you now and don t show the money to anyone or say a word about it
my greetings to rodion romanovitch
by the way you d better put the money for the present in razumihin s keeping
take it to him or when the time comes
and till then hide it carefully
sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at svidriga√Ølov
she longed to speak to ask a question but for the first moments she did not dare and did not know how to begin
how can you how can you be going now in such rain
why be starting for america and be stopped by rain
live and live long you will be of use to others
by the way tell razumihin i send my greetings to him
tell him arkady ivanovitch svidriga√Ølov sends his greetings
he went out leaving sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague apprehension
it appeared afterwards that on the same evening at twenty past eleven he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit
drenched to the skin he walked into the little flat where the parents of his betrothed lived in third street in vassilyevsky island
he knocked some time before he was admitted and his visit at first caused great perturbation but svidriga√Ølov could be very fascinating when he liked so that the first and indeed very intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that svidriga√Ølov had probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing vanished immediately
the decrepit father was wheeled in to see svidriga√Ølov by the tender and sensible mother who as usual began the conversation with various irrelevant questions
she never asked a direct question but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then if she were obliged to ascertain something for instance when svidriga√Ølov would like to have the wedding she would begin by interested and almost eager questions about paris and the court life there and only by degrees brought the conversation round to third street
on other occasions this had of course been very impressive but this time arkady ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient and insisted on seeing his betrothed at once though he had been informed to begin with that she had already gone to bed
svidriga√Ølov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important affairs to leave petersburg for a time and therefore brought her fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from him as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present before their wedding
the logical connection of the present with his immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear
but it all went off very well even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained
on the other hand the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced by tears from the most sensible of mothers
svidriga√Ølov got up laughed kissed his betrothed patted her cheek declared he would soon come back and noticing in her eyes together with childish curiosity a sort of earnest dumb inquiry reflected and kissed her again though he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers
he went away leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement but the tender mamma speaking quietly in a half whisper settled some of the most important of their doubts concluding that svidriga√Ølov was a great man a man of great affairs and connections and of great wealth there was no knowing what he had in his mind
he would start off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him so that there was nothing surprising about it
of course it was strange that he was wet through but englishmen for instance are even more eccentric and all these people of high society didn t think of what was said of them and didn t stand on ceremony
possibly indeed he came like that on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone
above all not a word should be said about it for god knows what might come of it and the money must be locked up and it was most fortunate that fedosya the cook had not left the kitchen
and above all not a word must be said to that old cat madame resslich and so on and so on
they sat up whispering till two o clock but the girl went to bed much earlier amazed and rather sorrowful
svidriga√Ølov meanwhile exactly at midnight crossed the bridge on the way back to the mainland
the rain had ceased and there was a roaring wind
he began shivering and for one moment he gazed at the black waters of the little neva with a look of special interest even inquiry
but he soon felt it very cold standing by the water he turned and went towards y prospect
he walked along that endless street for a long time almost half an hour more than once stumbling in the dark on the wooden pavement but continually looking for something on the right side of the street
he had noticed passing through this street lately that there was a hotel somewhere towards the end built of wood but fairly large and its name he remembered was something like adrianople
he was not mistaken the hotel was so conspicuous in that place that he could not fail to see it even in the dark
it was a long blackened wooden building and in spite of the late hour there were lights in the windows and signs of life within
he went in and asked a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room
the latter scanning svidriga√Ølov pulled himself together and led him at once to a close and tiny room in the distance at the end of the corridor under the stairs
there was no other all were occupied
the ragged fellow looked inquiringly
and you want nothing else he asked with apparent surprise
the ragged man went away completely disillusioned
it must be a nice place thought svidriga√Ølov
i expect i look as if i came from a caf√© chantant and have had some adventure on the way
it would be interesting to know who stayed here
he lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully
it was a room so that svidriga√Ølov could only just stand up in it it had one window the bed which was very dirty and the chair and table almost filled it up
the walls looked as though they were made of planks covered with shabby paper so torn and dusty that the pattern was indistinguishable though the general colour yellow could still be made out
one of the walls was cut short by the sloping ceiling though the room was not an attic but just under the stairs
svidriga√Ølov set down the candle sat down on the bed and sank into thought
but a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout in the next room attracted his attention
the murmur had not ceased from the moment he entered the room
he listened someone was upbraiding and almost tearfully scolding but he heard only one voice
svidriga√Ølov got up shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw light through a crack in the wall he went up and peeped through
the room which was somewhat larger than his had two occupants
one of them a very man with a red inflamed face was standing in the pose of an orator without his coat with his legs wide apart to preserve his balance and smiting himself on the breast
he reproached the other with being a beggar with having no standing whatever
he declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn him out when he liked and that only the finger of providence sees it all
the object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair and had the air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze but can t
he sometimes turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker but obviously had not the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it
a candle was burning down on the table there were a nearly empty bottle of vodka bread and cucumber and glasses with the dregs of stale tea
after gazing attentively at this svidriga√Ølov turned away indifferently and sat down on the bed
the ragged attendant returning with the tea could not resist asking him again whether he didn t want anything more and again receiving a negative reply finally withdrew
svidriga√Ølov made haste to drink a glass of tea to warm himself but could not eat anything
he took off his coat and wrapping himself in the blanket lay down on the bed
it would have been better to be well for the occasion he thought with a smile
the room was close the candle burnt dimly the wind was roaring outside he heard a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of leather
he lay in a sort of reverie one thought followed another
he felt a longing to fix his imagination on something
it must be a garden under the window he thought
how i dislike the sound of trees on a stormy night in the dark
he remembered how he had disliked it when he passed petrovsky park just now
this reminded him of the bridge over the little neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there
i never have liked water he thought even in a landscape and he suddenly smiled again at a strange idea surely now all these questions of taste and comfort ought not to matter but i ve become more particular like an animal that picks out a special place for such an occasion
i ought to have gone into the petrovsky park
as though i were seeking pleasant sensations
by the way why haven t i put out the candle
they ve gone to bed next door he thought not seeing the light at the crack
well now marfa petrovna now is the time for you to turn up it s dark and the very time and place for you
he suddenly recalled how an hour before carrying out his design on dounia he had recommended raskolnikov to trust her to razumihin s keeping
i suppose i really did say it as raskolnikov guessed to tease myself
but what a rogue that raskolnikov is
he may be a successful rogue in time when he s got over his nonsense
these young men are contemptible on that point
let him please himself it s nothing to do with me
by degrees dounia s image rose before him and a shudder ran over him
no i must give up all that now he thought rousing himself
i never had a great hatred for anyone i never particularly desired to avenge myself even and that s a bad sign a bad sign a bad sign
i never liked quarrelling either and never lost my temper that s a bad sign too
and the promises i made her just now too damnation
but who knows perhaps she would have made a new man of me somehow
he ground his teeth and sank into silence again
again dounia s image rose before him just as she was when after shooting the first time she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him so that he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand to defend herself if he had not reminded her
he recalled how at that instant he felt almost sorry for her how he had felt a pang at his heart a√Øe damnation these thoughts again
he was dozing off the feverish shiver had ceased when suddenly something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes
i believe it s a mouse he thought that s the veal i left on the table
he felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the blanket get up get cold but all at once something unpleasant ran over his leg again
he pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle
shaking with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed there was nothing
he shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet
he tried to catch it but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without leaving the bed slipped between his fingers ran over his hand and suddenly darted under the pillow
he threw down the pillow but in one instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down his back under his shirt
he trembled nervously and woke up
he was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket as before
the wind was howling under the window
how disgusting he thought with annoyance
he got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the window
it s better not to sleep at all he decided
there was a cold damp draught from the window however without getting up he drew the blanket over him and wrapped himself in it
he was not thinking of anything and did not want to think
but one image rose after another incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his mind
perhaps the cold or the dampness or the dark or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic
he kept dwelling on images of flowers he fancied a charming flower garden a bright warm almost hot day a holiday trinity day
a fine sumptuous country cottage in the english taste overgrown with fragrant flowers with flower beds going round the house the porch wreathed in climbers was surrounded with beds of roses
a light cool staircase carpeted with rich rugs was decorated with rare plants in china pots
he noticed particularly in the windows nosegays of tender white heavily fragrant narcissus bending over their bright green thick long stalks
he was reluctant to move away from them but he went up the stairs and came into a large high and again everywhere at the windows the doors on to the balcony and on the balcony itself were flowers
the floors were strewn with fragrant hay the windows were open a fresh cool light air came into the room
the birds were chirruping under the window and in the middle of the room on a table covered with a white satin shroud stood a coffin
the coffin was covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill wreaths of flowers surrounded it on all sides
among the flowers lay a girl in a white muslin dress with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom as though carved out of marble
but her loose fair hair was wet there was a wreath of roses on her head
the stern and already rigid profile of her face looked as though chiselled of marble too and the smile on her pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal
svidriga√Ølov knew that girl there was no holy image no burning candle beside the coffin no sound of prayers the girl had drowned herself
she was only fourteen but her heart was broken
and she had destroyed herself crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish soul had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn from her a last scream of despair unheeded and brutally disregarded on a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled
svidriga√Ølov came to himself got up from the bed and went to the window
he felt for the latch and opened it
the wind lashed furiously into the little room and stung his face and his chest only covered with his shirt as though with frost
under the window there must have been something like a garden and apparently a pleasure garden
there too probably there were and singing in the daytime
now drops of rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes it was dark as in a cellar so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of objects
svidriga√Ølov bending down with elbows on the gazed for five minutes into the darkness the boom of a cannon followed by a second one resounded in the darkness of the night
the river is overflowing he thought
by morning it will be swirling down the street in the lower parts flooding the basements and cellars
the cellar rats will swim out and men will curse in the rain and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys
and he had hardly thought it when somewhere near a clock on the wall ticking away hurriedly struck three
i ll go out at once straight to the park
i ll choose a great bush there drenched with rain so that as soon as one s shoulder touches it millions of drops drip on one s head
he moved away from the window shut it lighted the candle put on his waistcoat his overcoat and his hat and went out carrying the candle into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in the midst of and all sorts of rubbish to pay him for the room and leave the hotel
it s the best minute i couldn t choose a better
he walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding anyone and was just going to call out when suddenly in a dark corner between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object which seemed to be alive
he bent down with the candle and saw a little girl not more than five years old shivering and crying with her clothes as wet as a soaking
she did not seem afraid of svidriga√Ølov but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big black eyes
now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been crying a long time but are beginning to be comforted
the child s face was pale and tired she was numb with cold
she must have hidden here and not slept all night
the child suddenly becoming animated chattered away in her baby language something about mammy and that mammy would beat her and about some cup that she had bwoken
the child chattered on without stopping
he could only guess from what she said that she was a neglected child whose mother probably a drunken cook in the service of the hotel whipped and frightened her that the child had broken a cup of her mother s and was so frightened that she had run away the evening before had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the rain at last had made her way in here hidden behind the cupboard and spent the night there crying and trembling from the damp the darkness and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it
he took her in his arms went back to his room sat her on the bed and began undressing her
the torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night
when he had undressed her he put her on the bed covered her up and wrapped her in the blanket from her head downwards
then he sank into dreary musing again
what folly to trouble myself he decided suddenly with an oppressive feeling of annoyance
in vexation he took up the candle to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away
he thought as he opened the door but he turned again to see whether the child was asleep
he raised the blanket carefully
the child was sleeping soundly she had got warm under the blanket and her pale cheeks were flushed
but strange to say that flush seemed brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood
it s a flush of fever thought svidriga√Ølov
it was like the flush from drinking as though she had been given a full glass to drink
her crimson lips were hot and glowing but what was this
he suddenly fancied that her long black eyelashes were quivering as though the lids were opening and a sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink as though the little girl were not asleep but pretending
the corners of her mouth quivered as though she were trying to control them
but now she quite gave up all effort now it was a grin a broad grin there was something shameless provocative in that quite unchildish face it was depravity it was the face of a harlot the shameless face of a french harlot
now both eyes opened wide they turned a glowing shameless glance upon him they laughed invited him
there was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that laugh in those eyes in such nastiness in the face of a child
what at five years old svidriga√Ølov muttered in genuine horror
and now she turned to him her little face all aglow holding out her arms
svidriga√Ølov cried raising his hand to strike her but at that moment he woke up
he was in the same bed still wrapped in the blanket
the candle had not been lighted and daylight was streaming in at the windows
he got up angrily feeling utterly shattered his bones ached
there was a thick mist outside and he could see nothing
he got up put on his still damp jacket and overcoat
feeling the revolver in his pocket he took it out
reading them over he sank into thought with his elbows on the table
some flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal which was still on the table
he stared at them and at last with his free right hand began trying to catch one
he tried till he was tired but could not catch it
at last realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit he started got up and walked resolutely out of the room
a thick milky mist hung over the town
svidriga√Ølov walked along the slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the little neva
he was picturing the waters of the little neva swollen in the night petrovsky island the wet paths the wet grass the wet trees and bushes and at last the bush
he began staring at the houses trying to think of something else
there was not a cabman or a in the street
the bright yellow wooden little houses looked dirty and dejected with their closed shutters
the cold and damp penetrated his whole body and he began to shiver
from time to time he came across shop signs and read each carefully
at last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and came to a big stone house
a dirty shivering dog crossed his path with its tail between its legs
a man in a greatcoat lay face downwards dead drunk across the pavement
a high tower stood up on the left
it will be in the presence of an official witness anyway
he almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where there was the big house with the tower
at the great closed gates of the house a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them wrapped in a grey soldier s coat with a copper achilles helmet on his head
he cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at svidriga√Ølov
his face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection which is so sourly printed on all faces of jewish race without exception
they both svidriga√Ølov and achilles stared at each other for a few minutes without speaking
at last it struck achilles as irregular for a man not drunk to be standing three steps from him staring and not saying a word
he said without moving or changing his position
nothing brother good morning answered svidriga√Ølov
i am going to foreign parts brother
to foreign parts to svidriga√Ølov took out the revolver and cocked it
i say this is not the place for such jokes
when you are asked you just say he was going he said to america
he put the revolver to his right temple
you can t do it here it s not the place cried achilles rousing himself his eyes growing bigger and bigger
svidriga√Ølov pulled the trigger
the same day about seven o clock in the evening raskolnikov was on his way to his mother s and sister s lodging the lodging in bakaleyev s house which razumihin had found for them
the stairs went up from the street
raskolnikov walked with lagging steps as though still hesitating whether to go or not
but nothing would have turned him back his decision was taken
besides it doesn t matter they still know nothing he thought and they are used to thinking of me as eccentric
he was appallingly dressed his clothes torn and dirty soaked with a night s rain
his face was almost distorted from fatigue exposure the inward conflict that had lasted for hours
he had spent all the previous night alone god knows where
but anyway he had reached a decision
he knocked at the door which was opened by his mother
even the servant happened to be out
at first pulcheria alexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise then she took him by the hand and drew him into the room
don t be angry with me rodya for welcoming you so foolishly with tears i am laughing not crying
no i am delighted but i ve got into such a stupid habit of shedding tears
i ve been like that ever since your father s death
sit down dear boy you must be tired i see you are
i was in the rain yesterday mother
no no pulcheria alexandrovna hurriedly interrupted you thought i was going to you in the womanish way i used to don t be anxious i understand i understand it all now i ve learned the ways here and truly i see for myself that they are better
i ve made up my mind once for all how could i understand your plans and expect you to give an account of them
god knows what concerns and plans you may have or what ideas you are hatching so it s not for me to keep nudging your elbow asking you what you are thinking about
why am i running to and fro as though i were crazy
i am reading your article in the magazine for the third time rodya
dmitri prokofitch brought it to me
directly i saw it i cried out to myself there foolish one i thought that s what he is busy about that s the solution of the mystery
learned people are always like that
he may have some new ideas in his head just now he is thinking them over and i worry him and upset him
i read it my dear and of course there was a great deal i did not understand but that s only natural how should i show me mother
raskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article
incongruous as it was with his mood and his circumstances he felt that strange and bitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he sees himself in print besides he was only
after reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed with anguish
he recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding months
he flung the article on the table with disgust and anger
but however foolish i may be rodya i can see for myself that you will very soon be one of the leading if not the leading man in the world of russian thought
and they dared to think you were mad
you don t know but they really thought that
ah the despicable creatures how could they understand genius
and dounia dounia was all but believing it what do you say to that
your father sent twice to magazines the first time poems i ve got the manuscript and will show you and the second time a whole novel i begged him to let me copy it out and how we prayed that they should be taken they weren t
i was breaking my heart rodya six or seven days ago over your food and your clothes and the way you are living
but now i see again how foolish i was for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and talent
no doubt you don t care about that for the present and you are occupied with much more important matters
dounia s not at home mother no rodya
i often don t see her she leaves me alone
dmitri prokofitch comes to see me it s so good of him and he always talks about you
he loves you and respects you my dear
i don t say that dounia is very wanting in consideration
she has her ways and i have mine she seems to have got some secrets of late and i never have any secrets from you two
of course i am sure that dounia has far too much sense and besides she loves you and me but i don t know what it will all lead to
you ve made me so happy by coming now rodya but she has missed you by going out when she comes in i ll tell her your brother came in while you were out
where have you been all this time
you mustn t spoil me rodya you know come when you can but if you can t it doesn t matter i can wait
i shall know anyway that you are fond of me that will be enough for me
i shall read what you write i shall hear about you from everyone and sometimes you ll come yourself to see me
here you ve come now to comfort your mother i see that
here pulcheria alexandrovna began to cry
my goodness why am i sitting here
there is coffee and i don t offer you any
ah that s the selfishness of old age
mother don t trouble i am going at once
pulcheria alexandrovna went up to him timidly
mother whatever happens whatever you hear about me whatever you are told about me will you always love me as you do now
he asked suddenly from the fullness of his heart as though not thinking of his words and not weighing them
how can you ask me such a question
why who will tell me anything about you
besides i shouldn t believe anyone i should refuse to listen
i ve come to assure you that i ve always loved you and i am glad that we are alone even glad dounia is out he went on with the same impulse
i have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy you must believe that your son loves you now more than himself and that all you thought about me that i was cruel and didn t care about you was all a mistake
i shall never cease to love you
well that s enough i thought i must do this and begin with this
pulcheria alexandrovna embraced him in silence pressing him to her bosom and weeping gently
i don t know what is wrong with you rodya she said at last
i ve been thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now i see that there is a great sorrow in store for you and that s why you are miserable
i ve foreseen it a long time rodya
forgive me for speaking about it
i keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights
your sister lay talking in her sleep all last night talking of nothing but you
i caught something but i couldn t make it out
i felt all the morning as though i were going to be hanged waiting for something expecting something and now it has come
rodya rodya where are you going
i can come with you you know if you need me
and dounia too she loves you she loves you dearly and sofya semyonovna may come with us if you like
you see i am glad to look upon her as a daughter even
dmitri prokofitch will help us to go together
what she cried as though losing him for ever
no but kneel down and pray to god for me
your prayer perhaps will reach him
let me bless you and sign you with the cross
yes he was glad he was very glad that there was no one there that he was alone with his mother
for the first time after all those awful months his heart was softened
he fell down before her he kissed her feet and both wept embracing
and she was not surprised and did not question him this time
for some days she had realised that something awful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had come for him
rodya my darling my first born she said sobbing now you are just as when you were little
you would run like this to me and hug me and kiss me
when your father was living and we were poor you comforted us simply by being with us and when i buried your father how often we wept together at his grave and embraced as now
and if i ve been crying lately it s that my mother s heart had a foreboding of trouble
the first time i saw you that evening you remember as soon as we arrived here i guessed simply from your eyes
my heart sank at once and when i opened the door and looked at you i thought the fatal hour had come
rodya rodya you are not going away
rodya don t be angry i don t dare to question you
only say two words to me is it far where you are going
what god sends only pray for me
raskolnikov went to the door but she clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes
enough mother said raskolnikov deeply regretting that he had come
not for ever it s not yet for ever
it was a warm fresh bright evening it had cleared up in the morning
raskolnikov went to his lodgings he made haste
he wanted to finish all before sunset
he did not want to meet anyone till then
going up the stairs he noticed that nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him intently
can anyone have come to see me he wondered
he had a disgusted vision of porfiry
but opening his door he saw dounia
she was sitting alone plunged in deep thought and looked as though she had been waiting a long time
he stopped short in the doorway
she rose from the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him
her eyes fixed upon him betrayed horror and infinite grief
and from those eyes alone he saw at once that she knew
i ve been all day with sofya semyonovna
we thought that you would be sure to come there
raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair
i feel weak dounia i am very tired and i should have liked at this moment to be able to control myself
he glanced at her mistrustfully
you see sister i wanted to make up my mind once for all and several times i walked by the neva i remember that i wanted to end it all there but
i couldn t make up my mind he whispered looking at her mistrustfully again
that was just what we were afraid of sofya semyonovna and i
then you still have faith in life
i haven t faith but i have just been weeping in mother s arms i haven t faith but i have just asked her to pray for me
i don t know how it is dounia i don t understand it
no i didn t tell her in words but she understood a great deal
she heard you talking in your sleep
i am sure she half understands it already
perhaps i did wrong in going to see her
i am a contemptible person dounia
a contemptible person but ready to face suffering
yes to escape the disgrace i thought of drowning myself dounia but as i looked into the water i thought that if i had considered myself strong till now i d better not be afraid of disgrace he said hurrying on
there was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes he seemed to be glad to think that he was still proud
you don t think sister that i was simply afraid of the water
he asked looking into her face with a sinister smile
he sat with his eyes fixed on the floor dounia stood at the other end of the table and looked at him with anguish
i am going at once to give myself up
but i don t know why i am going to give myself up
you are crying sister but can you hold out your hand to me
aren t you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering
she cried holding him close and kissing him
that i killed a vile noxious insect an old pawnbroker woman of use to no one
killing her was atonement for forty sins
she was sucking the life out of poor people
i am not thinking of it and i am not thinking of expiating it and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides
only now i see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice now that i have decided to face this superfluous disgrace
it s simply because i am contemptible and have nothing in me that i have decided to perhaps too for my advantage as that
brother brother what are you saying
why you have shed blood cried dounia in despair
which all men shed he put in almost frantically which flows and has always flowed in streams which is spilt like champagne and for which men are crowned in the capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of mankind
look into it more carefully and understand it
i too wanted to do good to men and would have done hundreds thousands of good deeds to make up for that one piece of stupidity not stupidity even simply clumsiness for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now that it has failed
everything seems stupid when it fails
by that stupidity i only wanted to put myself into an independent position to take the first step to obtain means and then everything would have been smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison
i couldn t carry out even the first step because i am contemptible that s what s the matter
and yet i won t look at it as you do
if i had succeeded i should have been crowned with glory but now i m trapped
ah it s not picturesque not √¶sthetically attractive
i fail to understand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable
the fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence
i ve never never recognised this more clearly than now and i am further than ever from seeing that what i did was a crime
i ve never never been stronger and more convinced than now
the colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face but as he uttered his last explanation he happened to meet dounia s eyes and he saw such anguish in them that he could not help being checked
he felt that he had anyway made these two poor women miserable that he was anyway the cause
dounia darling if i am guilty forgive me though i can not be forgiven if i am guilty
don t follow me i beseech you i have somewhere else to go
but you go at once and sit with mother
don t leave her at all i left her in a state of anxiety that she is not fit to bear she will die or go out of her mind
don t cry about me i ll try to be honest and manly all my life even if i am a murderer
perhaps i shall some day make a name
i won t disgrace you you will see i ll still show
now for the present he concluded hurriedly noticing again a strange expression in dounia s eyes at his last words and promises
don t cry don t cry we are not parting for ever
he went to the table took up a thick dusty book opened it and took from between the pages a little portrait on ivory
it was the portrait of his landlady s daughter who had died of fever that strange girl who had wanted to be a nun
for a minute he gazed at the delicate expressive face of his betrothed kissed the portrait and gave it to dounia
i used to talk a great deal about it to her only to her he said thoughtfully
to her heart i confided much of what has since been so hideously realised
don t be uneasy he returned to dounia she was as much opposed to it as you and i am glad that she is gone
the great point is that everything now is going to be different is going to be broken in two he cried suddenly returning to his dejection
everything everything and am i prepared for it
they say it is necessary for me to suffer
what s the object of these senseless sufferings
shall i know any better what they are for when i am crushed by hardships and idiocy and weak as an old man after twenty years penal servitude
and what shall i have to live for then
why am i consenting to that life now
oh i knew i was contemptible when i stood looking at the neva at daybreak
it was hard for dounia but she loved him
she walked away but after going fifty paces she turned round to look at him again
at the corner he too turned and for the last time their eyes met but noticing that she was looking at him he motioned her away with impatience and even vexation and turned the corner abruptly
i am wicked i see that he thought to himself feeling ashamed a moment later of his angry gesture to dounia
but why are they so fond of me if i don t deserve it
oh if only i were alone and no one loved me
and i too had never loved anyone
but i wonder shall i in those fifteen or twenty years grow so meek that i shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word that i am a criminal
yes that s it that s it that s what they are sending me there for that s what they want
look at them running to and fro about the streets every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at heart and worse still an idiot
but try to get me off and they d be wild with righteous indignation
he fell to musing by what process it could come to pass that he could be humbled before all of them indiscriminately humbled by conviction
would not twenty years of continual bondage crush him utterly
and why why should he live after that
why should he go now when he knew that it would be so
it was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that question since the previous evening but still he went
chapter viii when he went into sonia s room it was already getting dark
all day sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety
dounia had been waiting with her
she had come to her that morning remembering svidriga√Ølov s words that sonia knew
we will not describe the conversation and tears of the two girls and how friendly they became
dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview that her brother would not be alone
he had gone to her sonia first with his confession he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it she would go with him wherever fate might send him
dounia did not ask but she knew it was so
she looked at sonia almost with reverence and at first almost embarrassed her by it
sonia was almost on the point of tears
she felt herself on the contrary hardly worthy to look at dounia
dounia s gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at their first meeting in raskolnikov s room had remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life
dounia at last became impatient and leaving sonia went to her brother s room to await him there she kept thinking that he would come there first
when she had gone sonia began to be tortured by the dread of his committing suicide and dounia too feared it
but they had spent the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be and both were less anxious while they were together
as soon as they parted each thought of nothing else
sonia remembered how svidriga√Ølov had said to her the day before that raskolnikov had two alternatives siberia or
besides she knew his vanity his pride and his lack of faith
is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to make him live
sonia was standing in dejection looking intently out of the window but from it she could see nothing but the unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house
at last when she began to feel sure of his death he walked into the room
she gave a cry of joy but looking carefully into his face she turned pale
i have come for your cross sonia
it was you told me to go to the why is it you are frightened now it s come to that
his tone seemed strange to her a cold shiver ran over her but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the words were a mask
he spoke to her looking away as though to avoid meeting her eyes
you see sonia i ve decided that it will be better so
but it s a long story and there s no need to discuss it
it annoys me that all those stupid brutish faces will be gaping at me directly pestering me with their stupid questions which i shall have to answer they ll point their fingers at me
you know i am not going to porfiry i am sick of him
i d rather go to my friend the explosive lieutenant how i shall surprise him what a sensation i shall make
but i must be cooler i ve become too irritable of late
you know i was nearly shaking my fist at my sister just now because she turned to take a last look at me
he seemed hardly to know what he was doing
he could not stay still or concentrate his attention on anything his ideas seemed to gallop after one another he talked incoherently his hands trembled slightly
without a word sonia took out of the drawer two crosses one of cypress wood and one of copper
she made the sign of the cross over herself and over him and put the wooden cross on his neck
it s the symbol of my taking up the cross he laughed
as though i had not suffered much till now
the wooden cross that is the peasant one the copper one that is lizaveta s you will wear yourself show me
so she had it on at that moment
i remember two things like these too a silver one and a little ikon
i threw them back on the old woman s neck
those would be appropriate now really those are what i ought to put on now
but i am talking nonsense and forgetting what matters i m somehow forgetful
you see i have come to warn you sonia so that you might know
that s all that s all i came for
but i thought i had more to say
well now i am going to prison and you ll have your wish
but his feeling was stirred his heart ached as he looked at her
why is she looking after me like my mother or dounia
cross yourself say at least one prayer sonia begged in a timid broken voice
oh certainly as much as you like
but he wanted to say something quite different
he crossed himself several times
sonia took up her shawl and put it over her head
it was the green de shawl of which marmeladov had spoken the family shawl
raskolnikov thought of that looking at it but he did not ask
he began to feel himself that he was certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated
he was suddenly struck too by the thought that sonia meant to go with him
i ll go alone he cried in cowardly vexation and almost resentful he moved towards the door
what s the use of going in procession he muttered going out
sonia remained standing in the middle of the room
he had not even said to her he had forgotten her
a poignant and rebellious doubt surged in his heart
was it right was it right all this
he thought again as he went down the stairs
couldn t he stop and retract it all and not go
he felt suddenly once for all that he mustn t ask himself questions
as he turned into the street he remembered that he had not said to sonia that he had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl not daring to stir after he had shouted at her and he stopped short for a moment
at the same instant another thought dawned upon him as though it had been lying in wait to strike him then
why with what object did i go to her just now
i told her on business on what business
to tell her i was but where was the need
no no i drove her away just now like a dog
no i wanted her tears i wanted to see her terror to see how her heart ached
i had to have something to cling to something to delay me some friendly face to see
and i dared to believe in myself to dream of what i would do
i am a beggarly contemptible wretch contemptible
he walked along the canal bank and he had not much further to go
but on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it went to the hay market
he looked eagerly to right and left gazed intently at every object and could not fix his attention on anything everything slipped away
in another week another month i shall be driven in a prison van over this bridge how shall i look at the canal then
how shall i read those letters then
it s written here campany that s a thing to remember that letter and to look at it again in a month how shall i look at it then
what shall i be feeling and thinking then
how trivial it all must be what i am fretting about now
of course it must all be interesting in its way
i am becoming a baby i am showing off to myself why am i ashamed
that fat man a german he must be who pushed against me does he know whom he pushed
there s a peasant woman with a baby begging
it s curious that she thinks me happier than she is
i might give her something for the incongruity of it
here s a five copeck piece left in my pocket where did i get it
here here take it my good woman
god bless you the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice
it was distasteful very distasteful to be in a crowd but he walked just where he saw most people
he would have given anything in the world to be alone but he knew himself that he would not have remained alone for a moment
there was a man drunk and disorderly in the crowd he kept trying to dance and falling down
raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short jerky laugh
a minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him though he still stared
he moved away at last not remembering where he was but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly came over him overwhelming him body and mind
he suddenly recalled sonia s words go to the bow down to the people kiss the earth for you have sinned against it too and say aloud to the whole world i am a murderer
and the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time especially of the last hours had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively clutched at the chance of this new unmixed complete sensation
it came over him like a fit it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and spreading fire through him
everything in him softened at once and the tears started into his eyes
he fell to the earth on the spot
he knelt down in the middle of the square bowed down to the earth and kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture
he got up and bowed down a second time
he s boozed a youth near him observed
he s going to jerusalem brothers and saying to his children and his country
he s bowing down to all the world and kissing the great city of petersburg and its pavement added a workman who was a little drunk
quite a young man too observed a third
and a gentleman someone observed soberly
there s no knowing who s a gentleman and who isn t nowadays
these exclamations and remarks checked raskolnikov and the words i am a murderer which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips died away
he bore these remarks quietly however and without looking round he turned down a street leading to the police office
he had a glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him he had felt that it must be so
the second time he bowed down in the hay market he saw standing fifty paces from him on the left sonia
she was hiding from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the
she had followed him then on his painful way
raskolnikov at that moment felt and knew once for all that sonia was with him for ever and would follow him to the ends of the earth wherever fate might take him
but he was just reaching the fatal place
he went into the yard fairly resolutely
he had to mount to the third storey
i shall be some time going up he thought
he felt as though the fateful moment was still far off as though he had plenty of time left for consideration
again the same rubbish the same eggshells lying about on the spiral stairs again the open doors of the flats again the same kitchens and the same fumes and stench coming from them
raskolnikov had not been here since that day
his legs were numb and gave way under him but still they moved forward
he stopped for a moment to take breath to collect himself so as to enter a
if i must drink the cup what difference does it make
he imagined for an instant the figure of the explosive lieutenant ilya petrovitch
couldn t he turn back and go straight to nikodim fomitch s lodgings
at least then it would be done privately
if he must drink it drink it off at once
turning cold and hardly conscious he opened the door of the office
there were very few people in it this time only a house porter and a peasant
the doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen
raskolnikov walked into the next room
perhaps i still need not speak passed through his mind
some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was settling himself at a bureau to write
in a corner another clerk was seating himself
zametov was not there nor of course nikodim fomitch
raskolnikov asked addressing the person at the bureau
not a sound was heard not a sight was seen but i scent the russian
how does it go on in the fairy tale
a familiar voice cried suddenly
the explosive lieutenant stood before him
he had just come in from the third room
it is the hand of fate thought raskolnikov
what about cried ilya petrovitch
he was obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle exhilarated
if it s on business you are rather early
it s only a chance that i am here
dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after sunset and that the last time raskolnikov visited the police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for coming too translator
you didn t imagine i d forgotten
rodion ro ro rodionovitch that s it isn t it
yes yes of course rodion romanovitch
i made many inquiries about you
i assure you i ve been genuinely grieved since that since i behaved like that
it was explained to me afterwards that you were a literary man and a learned one too and so to say the first steps
what literary or scientific man does not begin by some originality of conduct
my wife and i have the greatest respect for literature in my wife it s a genuine passion
if only a man is a gentleman all the rest can be gained by talents learning good sense genius
as for a hat well what does a hat matter
i can buy a hat as easily as i can a bun but what s under the hat what the hat covers i can t buy that
i was even meaning to come and apologise to you but thought maybe you d
but i am forgetting to ask you is there anything you want really
i ve even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister a highly cultivated and charming person
i confess i was sorry i got so hot with you
but as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting fit that affair has been cleared up splendidly
perhaps you are changing your lodging on account of your family s arriving
i thought that i should find zametov here
of course you ve made friends i heard
he s not been here since yesterday
he quarrelled with everyone on leaving in the rudest way
he is a youngster that s all one might have expected something from him but there you know what they are our brilliant young men
he wanted to go in for some examination but it s only to talk and boast about it it will go no further than that
of course it s a very different matter with you or razumihin there your friend
your career is an intellectual one and you won t be deterred by failure
for you one may say all the attractions of life
nihil you are an ascetic a monk a hermit
a book a pen behind your ear a learned research that s where your spirit soars
have you read livingstone s travels
there are a great many nihilists about nowadays you know and indeed it is not to be wondered at
but we thought you are not a nihilist of course
believe me you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself
official duty is one thing but you are thinking i meant to say is quite another
it s not friendship but the feeling of a man and a citizen the feeling of humanity and of love for the almighty
i may be an official but i am always bound to feel myself a man and a citizen
zametov will make a scandal in the french style in a house of bad reputation over a glass of champagne that s all your zametov is good for
while i m perhaps so to speak burning with devotion and lofty feelings and besides i have rank consequence a post
i am married and have children i fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen but who is he may i ask
i appeal to you as a man ennobled by education
then these midwives too have become extraordinarily numerous
raskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly
the words of ilya petrovitch who had obviously been dining were for the most part a stream of empty sounds for him
he looked at him inquiringly not knowing how it would end
i mean those wenches the talkative ilya petrovitch continued
i think it a very satisfactory one
they go to the academy study anatomy
if i fall ill am i to send for a young lady to treat me
ilya petrovitch laughed quite pleased with his own wit
it s an immoderate zeal for education but once you re educated that s enough
why insult honourable people as that scoundrel zametov does
look at these suicides too how common they are you can t fancy
people spend their last halfpenny and kill themselves boys and girls and old people
only this morning we heard about a gentleman who had just come to town
nil pavlitch i say what was the name of that gentleman who shot himself
svidriga√Ølov someone answered from the other room with drowsy listlessness
he had lost his wife was a man of reckless habits and all of a sudden shot himself and in such a shocking way
my sister was governess in his family
then no doubt you can tell us something about him
he was drinking wine i knew nothing
raskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stifling him
yes i must go muttered raskolnikov
oh not at all as often as you like
it s a pleasure to see you and i am glad to say so
ilya petrovitch held out his hand
i understand i understand and it s a pleasure to see you
i am very glad raskolnikov smiled
he went out he reeled he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know what he was doing
he began going down the stairs supporting himself with his right hand against the wall
he fancied that a porter pushed past him on his way upstairs to the police office that a dog in the lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a at it and shouted
he went down and out into the yard
there not far from the entrance stood sonia pale and
there was a look of poignant agony of despair in her face
his lips worked in an ugly meaningless smile
he stood still a minute grinned and went back to the police office
ilya petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers
before him stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs
what s the matter raskolnikov with white lips and staring eyes came slowly nearer
he walked right to the table leaned his hand on it tried to say something but could not only incoherent sounds were audible
raskolnikov dropped on to a chair but he kept his eyes fixed on the face of ilya petrovitch which expressed unpleasant surprise
both looked at one another for a minute and waited
raskolnikov refused the water with his hand and softly and brokenly but distinctly said
was i killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister lizaveta with an axe and robbed them
ilya petrovitch opened his mouth
raskolnikov repeated his statement
on the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town one of the administrative centres of russia in the town there is a fortress in the fortress there is a prison
in the prison the convict rodion raskolnikov has been confined for nine months
almost a year and a half has passed since his crime
there had been little difficulty about his trial
the criminal adhered exactly firmly and clearly to his statement
he did not confuse nor misrepresent the facts nor soften them in his own interest nor omit the smallest detail
he explained every incident of the murder the secret of
the piece of wood with a strip of metal which was found in the murdered woman s hand
he described minutely how he had taken her keys what they were like as well as the chest and its contents he explained the mystery of lizaveta s murder described how koch and after him the student knocked and repeated all they had said to one another how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard nikolay and dmitri shouting how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards gone home
he ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the voznesensky prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found
the whole thing in fact was perfectly clear
the lawyers and the judges were very much struck among other things by the fact that he had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone without making use of them and that what was more he did not now remember what the trinkets were like or even how many there were
the fact that he had never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed incredible
there turned out to be in the purse three hundred and seventeen roubles and sixty copecks
from being so long under the stone some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the damp
they were a long while trying to discover why the accused man should tell a lie about this when about everything else he had made a truthful and straightforward confession
finally some of the lawyers more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really not looked into the purse and so didn t know what was in it when he hid it under the stone
but they immediately drew the deduction that the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental derangement through homicidal mania without object or the pursuit of gain
this fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary insanity so often applied in our days in criminal cases
moreover raskolnikov s hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses by zossimov his former fellow students his landlady and her servant
all this pointed strongly to the conclusion that raskolnikov was not quite like an ordinary murderer and robber but that there was another element in the case
to the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself
to the decisive question as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery he answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was his miserable position his poverty and helplessness and his desire to provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand roubles he had reckoned on finding
he had been led to the murder through his shallow and cowardly nature exasperated moreover by privation and failure
to the question what led him to confess he answered that it was his heartfelt repentance
the sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt
all the strange and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration
there could be no doubt of the abnormal and condition of the criminal at the time
the fact that he had made no use of what he had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse partly to his abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime
incidentally the murder of lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis a man commits two murders and forgets that the door is open
finally the confession at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by the false evidence given by nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism and when moreover there were no proofs against the real criminal no suspicions even porfiry petrovitch fully kept his word all this did much to soften the sentence
other circumstances too in the prisoner s favour came out quite unexpectedly
razumihin somehow discovered and proved that while raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting him for six months and when this student died leaving a decrepit old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral when he died
raskolnikov s landlady bore witness too that when they had lived in another house at five corners raskolnikov had rescued two little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so
this was investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses
these facts made an impression in his favour
and in the end the criminal was in consideration of extenuating circumstances condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a term of eight years only
at the very beginning of the trial raskolnikov s mother fell ill
dounia and razumihin found it possible to get her out of petersburg during the trial
razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from petersburg so as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time to see avdotya romanovna as often as possible
pulcheria alexandrovna s illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial derangement of her intellect
when dounia returned from her last interview with her brother she had found her mother already ill in feverish delirium
that evening razumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother s questions about raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her mother s benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of russia on a business commission which would bring him in the end money and reputation
but they were struck by the fact that pulcheria alexandrovna never asked them anything on the subject neither then nor thereafter
on the contrary she had her own version of her son s sudden departure she told them with tears how he had come to say to her hinting that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts and that rodya had many very powerful enemies so that it was necessary for him to be in hiding
as for his future career she had no doubt that it would be brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed
she assured razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman that his article and brilliant literary talent proved it
this article she was continually reading she even read it aloud almost took it to bed with her but scarcely asked where rodya was though the subject was obviously avoided by the others which might have been enough to awaken her suspicions
they began to be frightened at last at pulcheria alexandrovna s strange silence on certain subjects
she did not for instance complain of getting no letters from him though in previous years she had only lived on the hope of letters from her beloved rodya
this was the cause of great uneasiness to dounia the idea occurred to her that her mother suspected that there was something terrible in her son s fate and was afraid to ask for fear of hearing something still more awful
in any case dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of her faculties
it happened once or twice however that pulcheria alexandrovna gave such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her without mentioning where rodya was and on receiving unsatisfactory and suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent and this mood lasted for a long time
dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely silent on certain points but it became more and more evident that the poor mother suspected something terrible
dounia remembered her brother s telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her sleep on the night after her interview with svidriga√Ølov and before the fatal day of the confession had not she made out something from that
sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be succeeded by a period of hysterical animation and the invalid would begin to talk almost incessantly of her son of her hopes of his future
her fancies were sometimes very strange
they humoured her pretended to agree with her she saw perhaps that they were pretending but she still went on talking
five months after raskolnikov s confession he was sentenced
razumihin and sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible
at last the moment of separation came
dounia swore to her brother that the separation should not be for ever razumihin did the same
razumihin in his youthful ardour had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years and saving up a certain sum to emigrate to siberia a country rich in every natural resource and in need of workers active men and capital
there they would settle in the town where rodya was and all together would begin a new life
raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before
he asked a great deal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her
he worried so much about her that it alarmed dounia
when he heard about his mother s illness he became very gloomy
with sonia he was particularly reserved all the time
with the help of the money left to her by svidriga√Ølov sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the party of convicts in which he was despatched to siberia
not a word passed between raskolnikov and her on the subject but both knew it would be so
at the final he smiled strangely at his sister s and razumihin s fervent anticipations of their happy future together when he should come out of prison
he predicted that their mother s illness would soon have a fatal ending
two months later dounia was married to razumihin
it was a quiet and sorrowful wedding porfiry petrovitch and zossimov were invited however
during all this period razumihin wore an air of resolute determination
dounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she could not but believe in him
he displayed a rare strength of will
among other things he began attending university lectures again in order to take his degree
they were continually making plans for the future both counted on settling in siberia within five years at least
till then they rested their hopes on sonia
pulcheria alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to dounia s marriage with razumihin but after the marriage she became even more melancholy and anxious
to give her pleasure razumihin told her how raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two little children from a fire
these two pieces of news excited pulcheria alexandrovna s disordered imagination almost to ecstasy
she was continually talking about them even entering into conversation with strangers in the street though dounia always accompanied her
in public conveyances and shops wherever she could capture a listener she would begin the discourse about her son his article how he had helped the student how he had been burnt at the fire and so on
dounia did not know how to restrain her
apart from the danger of her morbid excitement there was the risk of someone s recalling raskolnikov s name and speaking of the recent trial
pulcheria alexandrovna found out the address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted on going to see her
at last her restlessness reached an extreme point
she would sometimes begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious
one morning she declared that by her reckoning rodya ought soon to be home that she remembered when he said to her he said that they must expect him back in nine months
she began to prepare for his coming began to do up her room for him to clean the furniture to wash and put up new hangings and so on
dounia was anxious but said nothing and helped her to arrange the room
after a fatiguing day spent in continual fancies in joyful and tears pulcheria alexandrovna was taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious
in her delirium she dropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her son s terrible fate than they had supposed
for a long time raskolnikov did not know of his mother s death though a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached siberia
it was carried on by means of sonia who wrote every month to the razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity
at first they found sonia s letters dry and unsatisfactory but later on they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better for from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate brother s life
sonia s letters were full of the most detail the simplest and clearest description of all raskolnikov s surroundings as a convict
there was no word of her own hopes no conjecture as to the future no description of her feelings
instead of any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life she gave the simple facts that is his own words an exact account of his health what he asked for at their interviews what commission he gave her and so on
all these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness
the picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness and precision
there could be no mistake because nothing was given but facts
but dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news especially at first
sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not ready to talk that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave him from their letters that he sometimes asked after his mother and that when seeing that he had guessed the truth she told him at last of her death she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly affected by it not externally at any rate
she told them that although he seemed so wrapped up in himself and as it were shut himself off from everyone he took a very direct and simple view of his new life that he understood his position expected nothing better for the time had no hopes as is so common in his position and scarcely seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings so unlike anything he had known before
she wrote that his health was satisfactory he did his work without shirking or seeking to do more he was almost indifferent about food but except on sundays and holidays the food was so bad that at last he had been glad to accept some money from her sonia to have his own tea every day
he begged her not to trouble about anything else declaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him
sonia wrote further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest that she had not seen the inside of their barracks but concluded that they were crowded miserable and unhealthy that he slept on a plank bed with a rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement
but that he lived so poorly and roughly not from any plan or design but simply from inattention and indifference
sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming unwilling to talk and rude to her
but that in the end these visits had become a habit and almost a necessity for him so that he was positively distressed when she was ill for some days and could not visit him
she used to see him on holidays at the prison gates or in the to which he was brought for a few minutes to see her
on working days she would go to see him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns or at the sheds on the banks of the irtish
about herself sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some acquaintances in the town that she did sewing and as there was scarcely a dressmaker in the town she was looked upon as an indispensable person in many houses
but she did not mention that the authorities were through her interested in raskolnikov that his task was lightened and so on
at last the news came dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and uneasiness in the preceding letters that he held aloof from everyone that his fellow prisoners did not like him that he kept silent for days at a time and was becoming very pale
in the last letter sonia wrote that he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of the hospital
but it was not the horrors of prison life not the hard labour the bad food the shaven head or the patched clothes that crushed him
what did he care for all those trials and hardships
he was even glad of the hard work
physically exhausted he could at least reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep
and what was the food to him the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it
in the past as a student he had often not had even that
his clothes were warm and suited to his manner of life
he did not even feel the fetters
was he ashamed of his shaven head and coat
sonia was afraid of him how could he be ashamed before her
and yet he was ashamed even before sonia whom he tortured because of it with his contemptuous rough manner
but it was not his shaven head and his fetters he was ashamed of his pride had been stung to the quick
it was wounded pride that made him ill
oh how happy he would have been if he could have blamed himself
he could have borne anything then even shame and disgrace
but he judged himself severely and his exasperated conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past except a simple which might happen to anyone
he was ashamed just because he raskolnikov had so hopelessly stupidly come to grief through some decree of blind fate and must humble himself and submit to the idiocy of a sentence if he were anyhow to be at peace
vague and objectless anxiety in the present and in the future a continual sacrifice leading to nothing that was all that lay before him
and what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he would only be and able to begin a new life
why he had been ready a thousand times before to give up existence for the sake of an idea for a hope even for a fancy
mere existence had always been too little for him he had always wanted more
perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he had thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others
and if only fate would have sent him repentance burning repentance that would have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep that repentance the awful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning
oh he would have been glad of it
tears and agonies would at least have been life
but he did not repent of his crime
at least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity as he had raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison
but now in prison he thought over and criticised all his actions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque as they had seemed at the fatal time
in what way he asked himself was my theory stupider than others that have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world
one has only to look at the thing quite independently broadly and uninfluenced by commonplace ideas and my idea will by no means seem so strange
oh sceptics and halfpenny philosophers why do you halt
why does my action strike them as so horrible
of course it was a legal crime of course the letter of the law was broken and blood was shed
well punish me for the letter of the law and that s enough
of course in that case many of the benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps
but those men succeeded and so were and i didn t and so i had no right to have taken that step
it was only in that that he recognised his criminality only in the fact that he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it
he suffered too from the question why had he not killed himself
why had he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess
was the desire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it
had not svidriga√Ølov overcome it although he was afraid of death
in misery he asked himself this question and could not understand that at the very time he had been standing looking into the river he had perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and his convictions
he didn t understand that that consciousness might be the promise of a future crisis of a new view of life and of his future resurrection
he preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he could not step over again through weakness and meanness
he looked at his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and prized it
it seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in prison than in freedom
what terrible agonies and privations some of them the tramps for instance had endured
could they care so much for a ray of sunshine for the primeval forest the cold spring hidden away in some unseen spot which the tramp had marked three years before and longed to see again as he might to see his sweetheart dreaming of the green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush
as he went on he saw still more inexplicable examples
in prison of course there was a great deal he did not see and did not want to see he lived as it were with downcast eyes
it was loathsome and unbearable for him to look
but in the end there was much that surprised him and he began as it were involuntarily to notice much that he had not suspected before
what surprised him most of all was the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest
they seemed to be a different species and he looked at them and they at him with distrust and hostility
he felt and knew the reasons of his isolation but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons were so deep and strong
there were some polish exiles political prisoners among them
they simply looked down upon all the rest as ignorant churls but raskolnikov could not look upon them like that
he saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the poles
there were some russians who were just as contemptuous a former officer and two seminarists
raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly
he was disliked and avoided by everyone they even began to hate him at last why he could not tell
men who had been far more guilty despised and laughed at his crime
you re a gentleman they used to say
you shouldn t hack about with an axe that s not a gentleman s work
the second week in lent his turn came to take the sacrament with his gang
he went to church and prayed with the others
a quarrel broke out one day he did not know how
all fell on him at once in a fury
you don t believe in god they shouted
he had never talked to them about god nor his belief but they wanted to kill him as an infidel
one of the prisoners rushed at him in a perfect frenzy
raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently his eyebrows did not quiver his face did not flinch
the guard succeeded in intervening between him and his assailant or there would have been bloodshed
there was another question he could not decide why were they all so fond of sonia
she did not try to win their favour she rarely met them sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment
and yet everybody knew her they knew that she had come out to follow knew how and where she lived
she never gave them money did them no particular services
only once at christmas she sent them all presents of pies and rolls
but by degrees closer relations sprang up between them and sonia
she would write and post letters for them to their relations
relations of the prisoners who visited the town at their instructions left with sonia presents and money for them
their wives and sweethearts knew her and used to visit her
and when she visited raskolnikov at work or met a party of the prisoners on the road they all took off their hats to her
little mother sofya semyonovna you are our dear good little mother coarse branded criminals said to that frail little creature
she would smile and bow to them and everyone was delighted when she smiled
they even admired her gait and turned round to watch her walking they admired her too for being so little and in fact did not know what to admire her most for
they even came to her for help in their illnesses
he was in the hospital from the middle of lent till after easter
when he was better he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish and delirious
he dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a terrible new strange plague that had come to europe from the depths of asia
all were to be destroyed except a very few chosen
some new sorts of microbes were attacking the bodies of men but these microbes were endowed with intelligence and will
men attacked by them became at once mad and furious
but never had men considered themselves so intellectual and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers never had they considered their decisions their scientific conclusions their moral convictions so infallible
whole villages whole towns and peoples went mad from the infection
all were excited and did not understand one another
each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched looking at the others beat himself on the breast wept and wrung his hands
they did not know how to judge and could not agree what to consider evil and what good they did not know whom to blame whom to justify
men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite
they gathered together in armies against one another but even on the march the armies would begin attacking each other the ranks would be broken and the soldiers would fall on each other stabbing and cutting biting and devouring each other
the alarm bell was ringing all day long in the towns men rushed together but why they were summoned and who was summoning them no one knew
the most ordinary trades were abandoned because everyone proposed his own ideas his own improvements and they could not agree
men met in groups agreed on something swore to keep together but at once began on something quite different from what they had proposed
they accused one another fought and killed each other
there were conflagrations and famine
all men and all things were involved in destruction
the plague spread and moved further and further
only a few men could be saved in the whole world
they were a pure chosen people destined to found a new race and a new life to renew and purify the earth but no one had seen these men no one had heard their words and their voices
raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so miserably the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long
the second week after easter had come
there were warm bright spring days in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel paced were opened
sonia had only been able to visit him twice during his illness each time she had to obtain permission and it was difficult
but she often used to come to the hospital yard especially in the evening sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the windows of the ward
one evening when he was almost well again raskolnikov fell asleep
on waking up he chanced to go to the window and at once saw sonia in the distance at the hospital gate
she seemed to be waiting for someone
something stabbed him to the heart at that minute
he shuddered and moved away from the window
next day sonia did not come nor the day after he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily
on reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that sofya semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out
he was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her he soon learnt that her illness was not dangerous
hearing that he was anxious about her sonia sent him a pencilled note telling him that she was much better that she had a slight cold and that she would soon very soon come and see him at his work
his heart throbbed painfully as he read it
early in the morning at six o clock he went off to work on the river bank where they used to pound alabaster and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed
there were only three of them sent
one of the convicts went with the guard to the fortress to fetch a tool the other began getting the wood ready and laying it in the kiln
raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river bank sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the wide deserted river
from the high bank a broad landscape opened before him the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank
in the vast steppe bathed in sunshine he could just see like black specks the nomads tents
there there was freedom there other men were living utterly unlike those here there time itself seemed to stand still as though the age of abraham and his flocks had not passed
raskolnikov sat gazing his thoughts passed into into contemplation he thought of nothing but a vague restlessness excited and troubled him
suddenly he found sonia beside him she had come up noiselessly and sat down at his side
it was still quite early the morning chill was still keen
she wore her poor old burnous and the green shawl her face still showed signs of illness it was thinner and paler
she gave him a joyful smile of welcome but held out her hand with her usual timidity
she was always timid of holding out her hand to him and sometimes did not offer it at all as though afraid he would repel it
he always took her hand as though with repugnance always seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout her visit
sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply grieved
but now their hands did not part
he stole a rapid glance at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking
they were alone no one had seen them
the guard had turned away for the time
how it happened he did not know
but all at once something seemed to seize him and fling him at her feet
he wept and threw his arms round her knees
for the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale
she jumped up and looked at him trembling
but at the same moment she understood and a light of infinite happiness came into her eyes
she knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and that at last the moment had come
they wanted to speak but could not tears stood in their eyes
they were both pale and thin but those sick pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future of a full resurrection into a new life
they were renewed by love the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other
they resolved to wait and be patient
they had another seven years to wait and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before them
but he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his being while she she only lived in his life
on the evening of the same day when the barracks were locked raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her
he had even fancied that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him differently he had even entered into talk with them and they answered him in a friendly way
he remembered that now and thought it was bound to be so
wasn t everything now bound to be changed
he remembered how continually he had tormented her and wounded her heart
he remembered her pale and thin little face
but these recollections scarcely troubled him now he knew with what infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings
and what were all the agonies of the past
everything even his crime his sentence and imprisonment seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an external strange fact with which he had no concern
but he could not think for long together of anything that evening and he could not have analysed anything consciously he was simply feeling
life had stepped into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out in his mind
under his pillow lay the new testament
the book belonged to sonia it was the one from which she had read the raising of lazarus to him
at first he was afraid that she would worry him about religion would talk about the gospel and pester him with books
but to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject and had not even offered him the testament
he had asked her for it himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without a word
he did not open it now but one thought passed through his mind can her convictions not be mine now
her feelings her aspirations at least
she too had been greatly agitated that day and at night she was taken ill again
but she was so happy and so unexpectedly happy that she was almost frightened of her happiness
at the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready to look on those seven years as though they were seven days
he did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing that he would have to pay dearly for it that it would cost him great striving great suffering
but that is the beginning of a new story the story of the gradual renewal of a man the story of his gradual regeneration of his passing from one world into another of his initiation into a new unknown life
that might be the subject of a new story but our present story is ended

sherlock holmes arrives too late i
the arrest of ars√®ne lupin it was a strange ending to a voyage that had commenced in a most auspicious manner
the transatlantic steamship la provence was a swift and comfortable vessel under the command of a most affable man
the passengers constituted a select and delightful society
the charm of new acquaintances and improvised amusements served to make the time pass agreeably
we enjoyed the pleasant sensation of being separated from the world living as it were upon an unknown island and consequently obliged to be sociable with each other
have you ever stopped to consider how much originality and spontaneity emanate from these various individuals who on the preceding evening did not even know each other and who are now for several days condemned to lead a life of extreme intimacy jointly defying the anger of the ocean the terrible onslaught of the waves the violence of the tempest and the agonizing monotony of the calm and sleepy water
such a life becomes a sort of tragic existence with its storms and its grandeurs its monotony and its diversity and that is why perhaps we embark upon that short voyage with mingled feelings of pleasure and fear
but during the past few years a new sensation had been added to the life of the transatlantic traveler
the little floating island is now attached to the world from which it was once quite free
a bond united them even in the very heart of the watery wastes of the atlantic
that bond is the wireless telegraph by means of which we receive news in the most mysterious manner
we know full well that the message is not transported by the medium of a hollow wire
no the mystery is even more inexplicable more romantic and we must have recourse to the wings of the air in order to explain this new miracle
during the first day of the voyage we felt that we were being followed escorted preceded even by that distant voice which from time to time whispered to one of us a few words from the receding world
ten twenty others sent gay or somber words of parting to other passengers
on the second day at a distance of five hundred miles from the french coast in the midst of a violent storm we received the following message by means of the wireless telegraph ars√®ne lupin is on your vessel first cabin blonde hair wound right traveling alone under name of r
at that moment a terrible flash of lightning rent the stormy skies
the electric waves were interrupted
the remainder of the dispatch never reached us
of the name under which ars√®ne lupin was concealing himself we knew only the initial
if the news had been of some other character i have no doubt that the secret would have been carefully guarded by the telegraphic operator as well as by the officers of the vessel
but it was one of those events calculated to escape from the most rigorous discretion
the same day no one knew how the incident became a matter of current gossip and every passenger was aware that the famous ars√®ne lupin was hiding in our midst
the irresponsible burglar whose exploits had been narrated in all the newspapers during the past few months
the mysterious individual with whom ganimard our shrewdest detective had been engaged in an implacable conflict amidst interesting and picturesque surroundings
ars√®ne lupin the eccentric gentleman who operates only in the ch√¢teaux and salons and who one night entered the residence of baron schormann but emerged leaving however his card on which he had scribbled these words ars√®ne lupin will return when the furniture is genuine
ars√®ne lupin the man of a thousand disguises in turn a chauffer detective bookmaker russian physician spanish commercial traveler robust youth or decrepit old man
then consider this startling situation ars√®ne lupin was wandering about within the limited bounds of a transatlantic steamer in that very small corner of the world in that dining saloon in that smoking room in that music room
ars√®ne lupin was perhaps this gentleman or that one
and this condition of affairs will last for five days
exclaimed miss nelly underdown next morning
and you monsieur d andr√©zy you are on intimate terms with the captain surely you know something
i should have been delighted had i possessed any information that would interest miss nelly
she was one of those magnificent creatures who inevitably attract attention in every assembly
wealth and beauty form an irresistible combination and nelly possessed both
educated in paris under the care of a french mother she was now going to visit her father the millionaire underdown of chicago
she was accompanied by one of her friends lady jerland
at first i had decided to open a flirtation with her but in the rapidly growing intimacy of the voyage i was soon impressed by her charming manner and my feelings became too deep and reverential for a mere flirtation
moreover she accepted my attentions with a certain degree of favor
she condescended to laugh at my witticisms and display an interest in my stories
yet i felt that i had a rival in the person of a young man with quiet and refined tastes and it struck me at times that she preferred his taciturn humor to my parisian frivolity
he formed one in the circle of admirers that surrounded miss nelly at the time she addressed to me the foregoing question
we were all comfortably seated in our
the storm of the preceding evening had cleared the sky
i have no definite knowledge mademoiselle i replied but can not we ourselves investigate the mystery quite as well as the detective ganimard the personal enemy of ars√®ne lupin
you are progressing very fast monsieur
in the first place let me ask do you find the problem a complicated one
have you forgotten the key we hold for the solution to the problem
in the first place lupin calls himself monsieur r
rather vague information she replied
well then we have only to peruse the and proceed by process of elimination
i took it out and glanced through it
then i remarked i find that there are only thirteen men on the whose names begin with the letter only thirteen
and of those thirteen i find that nine of them are accompanied by women children or servants
that leaves only four who are traveling alone
first the marquis de raverdan secretary to the american ambassador interrupted miss nelly
here exclaimed an italian whose face was concealed beneath a heavy black beard
miss nelly burst into laughter and exclaimed that gentleman can scarcely be called a blonde
very well then i said we are forced to the conclusion that the guilty party is the last one on the list
but miss nelly turned to the taciturn young man whose attentions to her had annoyed me and said well monsieur rozaine why do you not answer
all eyes were now turned upon him
i must confess that i myself felt a shock of surprise and the profound silence that followed her question indicated that the others present also viewed the situation with a feeling of sudden alarm
however the idea was an absurd one because the gentleman in question presented an air of the most perfect innocence
because considering my name my position as a solitary traveler and the color of my hair i have already reached the same conclusion and now think that i should be arrested
he presented a strange appearance as he uttered these words
his thin lips were drawn closer than usual and his face was ghastly pale whilst his eyes were streaked with blood
of course he was joking yet his appearance and attitude impressed us strangely
but you have not the wound said miss nelly naively
that is true he replied i lack the wound
then he pulled up his sleeve removing his cuff and showed us his arm
but that action did not deceive me
he had shown us his left arm and i was on the point of calling his attention to the fact when another incident diverted our attention
lady jerland miss nelly s friend came running towards us in a state of great excitement exclaiming my jewels my pearls
no they were not all gone as we soon found out
the thief had taken only part of them a very curious thing
of the diamond sunbursts jeweled pendants bracelets and necklaces the thief had taken not the largest but the finest and most valuable stones
the mountings were lying upon the table
i saw them there despoiled of their jewels like flowers from which the beautiful colored petals had been ruthlessly plucked
and this theft must have been committed at the time lady jerland was taking her tea in broad daylight in a stateroom opening on a much frequented corridor moreover the thief had been obliged to force open the door of the stateroom search for the which was hidden at the bottom of a open it select his booty and remove it from the mountings
of course all the passengers instantly reached the same conclusion it was the work of ars√®ne lupin
that day at the dinner table the seats to the right and left of rozaine remained vacant and during the evening it was rumored that the captain had placed him under arrest which information produced a feeling of safety and relief
that evening we resumed our games and dances
miss nelly especially displayed a spirit of thoughtless gayety which convinced me that if rozaine s attentions had been agreeable to her in the beginning she had already forgotten them
her charm and completed my conquest
at midnight under a bright moon i declared my devotion with an ardor that did not seem to displease her
but next day to our general amazement rozaine was at liberty
we learned that the evidence against him was not sufficient
he had produced documents that were perfectly regular which showed that he was the son of a wealthy merchant of bordeaux
besides his arms did not bear the slightest trace of a wound
certificates of birth exclaimed the enemies of rozaine of course ars√®ne lupin will furnish you as many as you desire
and as to the wound he never had it or he has removed it
then it was proven that at the time of the theft rozaine was promenading on the deck
to which fact his enemies replied that a man like ars√®ne lupin could commit a crime without being actually present
and then apart from all other circumstances there remained one point which even the most skeptical could not answer who except rozaine was traveling alone was a blonde and bore a name beginning with r
to whom did the telegram point if it were not rozaine
and when rozaine a few minutes before breakfast came boldly toward our group miss nelly and lady jerland arose and walked away
an hour later a manuscript circular was passed from hand to hand amongst the sailors the stewards and the passengers of all classes
louis rozaine offered a reward of ten thousand francs for the discovery of ars√®ne lupin or other person in possession of the stolen jewels
and if no one assists me i will unmask the scoundrel myself declared rozaine
rozaine against ars√®ne lupin or rather according to current opinion ars√®ne lupin himself against ars√®ne lupin the contest promised to be interesting
nothing developed during the next two days
we saw rozaine wandering about day and night searching questioning investigating
the captain also displayed commendable activity
he caused the vessel to be searched from stem to stern ransacked every stateroom under the plausible theory that the jewels might be concealed anywhere except in the thief s own room
i suppose they will find out something soon remarked miss nelly to me
he may be a wizard but he can not make diamonds and pearls become invisible
certainly not i replied but he should examine the lining of our hats and vests and everything we carry with us
then exhibiting my kodak a x with which i had been photographing her in various poses i added in an apparatus no larger than that a person could hide all of lady jerland s jewels
he could pretend to take pictures and no one would suspect the game
but i have heard it said that every thief leaves some clue behind him
that may be generally true i replied but there is one exception ars√®ne lupin
why because he concentrates his thoughts not only on the theft but on all the circumstances connected with it that could serve as a clue to his identity
a few days ago you were more confident
yes but since then i have seen him at work
and what do you think about it now
well in my opinion we are wasting our time
and as a matter of fact the investigation had produced no result
but in the meantime the captain s watch had been stolen
he quickened his efforts and watched rozaine more closely than before
but on the following day the watch was found in the second officer s collar box
this incident caused considerable astonishment and displayed the humorous side of ars√®ne lupin burglar though he was but dilettante as well
he combined business with pleasure
he reminded us of the author who almost died in a fit of laughter provoked by his own play
certainly he was an artist in his particular line of work and whenever i saw rozaine gloomy and reserved and thought of the double role that he was playing i accorded him a certain measure of admiration
on the following evening the officer on deck duty heard groans emanating from the darkest corner of the ship
he approached and found a man lying there his head enveloped in a thick gray scarf and his hands tied together with a heavy cord
he had been assaulted thrown down and robbed
a card pinned to his coat bore these words ars√®ne lupin accepts with pleasure the ten thousand francs offered by mon
as a matter of fact the stolen contained twenty thousand francs
of course some accused the unfortunate man of having simulated this attack on himself
but apart from the fact that he could not have bound himself in that manner it was established that the writing on the card was entirely different from that of rozaine but on the contrary resembled the handwriting of ars√®ne lupin as it was reproduced in an old newspaper found on board
thus it appeared that rozaine was not ars√®ne lupin but was rozaine the son of a bordeaux merchant
and the presence of ars√®ne lupin was once more affirmed and that in a most alarming manner
such was the state of terror amongst the passengers that none would remain alone in a stateroom or wander singly in unfrequented parts of the vessel
we clung together as a matter of safety
and yet the most intimate acquaintances were estranged by a mutual feeling of distrust
ars√®ne lupin was now anybody and everybody
our excited imaginations attributed to him miraculous and unlimited power
we supposed him capable of assuming the most unexpected disguises of being by turns the highly respectable major rawson or the noble marquis de raverdan or even for we no longer stopped with the accusing letter of r or even such or such a person well known to all of us and having wife children and servants
the first wireless dispatches from america brought no news at least the captain did not communicate any to us
our last day on the steamer seemed interminable
we lived in constant fear of some disaster
this time it would not be a simple theft or a comparatively harmless assault it would be a crime a murder
no one imagined that ars√®ne lupin would confine himself to those two trifling offenses
absolute master of the ship the authorities powerless he could do whatever he pleased our property and lives were at his mercy
yet those were delightful hours for me since they secured to me the confidence of miss nelly
deeply moved by those startling events and being of a highly nervous nature she spontaneously sought at my side a protection and security that i was pleased to give her
inwardly i blessed ars√®ne lupin
had he not been the means of bringing me and miss nelly closer to each other
thanks to him i could now indulge in delicious dreams of love and happiness dreams that i felt were not unwelcome to miss nelly
her smiling eyes authorized me to make them the softness of her voice bade me hope
as we approached the american shore the active search for the thief was apparently abandoned and we were anxiously awaiting the supreme moment in which the mysterious enigma would be explained
under what name under what disguise was the famous ars√®ne lupin concealing himself
and at last that supreme moment arrived
if i live one hundred years i shall not forget the slightest details of it
how pale you are miss nelly i said to my companion as she leaned upon my arm almost fainting
this is a most exciting moment and i am delighted to spend it with you miss nelly
i hope that your memory will sometimes revert
the gangway was placed in position but before we could use it the uniformed customs officers came on board
miss nelly murmured i shouldn t be surprised to hear that ars√®ne lupin escaped from the vessel during the voyage
perhaps he preferred death to dishonor and plunged into the atlantic rather than be arrested
suddenly i started and in answer to her question i said do you see that little old man standing at the bottom of the gangway
yes the celebrated detective who has sworn to capture ars√®ne lupin
i can understand now why we did not receive any news from this side of the atlantic
and he always keeps his business secret
then you think he will arrest ars√®ne lupin who can tell
the unexpected always happens when ars√®ne lupin is concerned in the affair
oh she exclaimed with that morbid curiosity peculiar to women i should like to see him arrested
no doubt ars√®ne lupin has already seen his enemy and will not be in a hurry to leave the steamer
the passengers were now leaving the steamer
leaning on his umbrella with an air of careless indifference ganimard appeared to be paying no attention to the crowd that was hurrying down the gangway
the marquis de raverdan major rawson the italian rivolta and many others had already left the vessel before rozaine appeared
perhaps it is he after all said miss nelly to me
i think it would be very interesting to have ganimard and rozaine in the same picture
i gave her the camera but too late for her to use it
rozaine was already passing the detective
an american officer standing behind ganimard leaned forward and whispered in his ear
the french detective shrugged his shoulders and rozaine passed on
then my god who was ars√®ne lupin
yes said miss nelly aloud who can it be
not more than twenty people now remained on board
she scrutinized them one by one fearful that ars√®ne lupin was not amongst them
we can not wait much longer i said to her
but we had not taken ten steps when ganimard barred our passage
one moment he repeated in a tone of authority
then gazing into my eyes he said ars√®ne lupin is it not
i laughed and replied no simply bernard d andr√©zy
bernard d andr√©zy died in macedonia three years ago
if bernard d andr√©zy were dead i should not be here
they are his and i can tell you exactly how they came into your possession
ars√®ne lupin sailed under the name of r yes another of your tricks a false scent that deceived them at havre
you play a good game my boy but this time luck is against you
then he hit me a sharp blow on the right arm which caused me to utter a cry of pain
he had struck the wound yet unhealed referred to in the telegram
i turned to miss nelly who had heard everything
our eyes met then she glanced at the kodak i had placed in her hands and made a gesture that conveyed to me the impression that she understood everything
yes there between the narrow folds of black leather in the hollow centre of the small object that i had taken the precaution to place in her hands before ganimard arrested me it was there i had deposited rozaine s twenty thousand francs and lady jerland s pearls and diamonds
i pledge my oath that at that solemn moment when i was in the grasp of ganimard and his two assistants i was perfectly indifferent to everything to my arrest the hostility of the people everything except this one question what will miss nelly do with the things i had confided to her
in the absence of that material and conclusive proof i had nothing to fear but would miss nelly decide to furnish that proof
would she act the part of an enemy who can not forgive or that of a woman whose scorn is softened by feelings of indulgence and involuntary sympathy
i said nothing but bowed very low
mingled with the other passengers she advanced to the gangway with my kodak in her hand
it occurred to me that she would not dare to expose me publicly but she might do so when she reached a more private place
however when she had passed only a few feet down the gangway with a movement of simulated awkwardness she let the camera fall into the water between the vessel and the pier
then she walked down the gangway and was quickly lost to sight in the crowd
she had passed out of my life forever
for a moment i stood motionless
then to ganimard s great astonishment i muttered what a pity that i am not an honest man
such was the story of his arrest as narrated to me by ars√®ne lupin himself
the various incidents which i shall record in writing at a later day have established between us certain ties
yes i venture to believe that ars√®ne lupin honors me with his friendship and that it is through friendship that he occasionally calls on me and brings into the silence of my library his youthful exuberance of spirits the contagion of his enthusiasm and the mirth of a man for whom destiny has naught but favors and smiles
i have seen him twenty times and each time he was a different person even he himself said to me on one occasion i no longer know who i am
i can not recognize myself in the mirror
certainly he was a great actor and possessed a marvelous faculty for disguising himself
without the slightest effort he could adopt the voice gestures and mannerisms of another person
why said he why should i retain a definite form and feature
why not avoid the danger of a personality that is ever the same
my actions will serve to identify me
then he added with a touch of pride so much the better if no one can ever say with absolute certainty there is ars√®ne lupin
the essential point is that the public may be able to refer to my work and say without fear of mistake ars√®ne lupin did that ii
ars√®ne lupin in prison there is no tourist worthy of the name who does not know the banks of the seine and has not noticed in passing the little feudal castle of the malaquis built upon a rock in the centre of the river
an arched bridge connects it with the shore
all around it the calm waters of the great river play peacefully amongst the reeds and the wagtails flutter over the moist crests of the stones
the history of the malaquis castle is stormy like its name harsh like its outlines
it has passed through a long series of combats sieges assaults rapines and massacres
a recital of the crimes that have been committed there would cause the stoutest heart to tremble
there are many mysterious legends connected with the castle and they tell us of a famous subterranean tunnel that formerly led to the abbey of jumieges and to the manor of agnes sorel mistress of charles vii
in that ancient habitation of heroes and brigands the baron nathan cahorn now lived or baron satan as he was formerly called on the bourse where he had acquired a fortune with incredible rapidity
the lords of malaquis absolutely ruined had been obliged to sell the ancient castle at a great sacrifice
it contained an admirable collection of furniture pictures wood carvings and faience
the baron lived there alone attended by three old servants
no one had ever beheld the three rubens that he possessed his two watteau his jean goujon pulpit and the many other treasures that he had acquired by a vast expenditure of money at public sales
baron satan lived in constant fear not for himself but for the treasures that he had accumulated with such an earnest devotion and with so much perspicacity that the shrewdest merchant could not say that the baron had ever erred in his taste or judgment
he loved them intensely like a miser jealously like a lover
every day at sunset the iron gates at either end of the bridge and at the entrance to the court of honor are closed and barred
at the least touch on these gates electric bells will ring throughout the castle
one thursday in september a presented himself at the gate at the head of the bridge and as usual it was the baron himself who partially opened the heavy portal
he scrutinized the man as minutely as if he were a stranger although the honest face and twinkling eyes of the postman had been familiar to the baron for many years
the man laughed as he said it is only i monsieur le baron
it is not another man wearing my cap and blouse
one can never tell muttered the baron
the man handed him a number of newspapers and then said and now monsieur le baron here is something new
living as a recluse without friends or business relations the baron never received any letters and the one now presented to him immediately aroused within him a feeling of suspicion and distrust
who was this mysterious correspondent that dared to disturb the tranquility of his retreat
you must sign for it monsieur le baron
he signed then took the letter waited until the postman had disappeared beyond the bend in the road and after walking nervously to and fro for a few minutes he leaned against the parapet of the bridge and opened the envelope
it contained a sheet of paper bearing this heading prison de la sant√© paris
then he read monsieur le baron there is in the gallery in your castle a picture of philippe de champaigne of exquisite finish which pleases me beyond measure
your rubens are also to my taste as well as your smallest watteau
in the salon to the right i have noticed the louis xiii the tapestries of beauvais the empire gueridon signed jacob and the renaissance chest
in the salon to the left all the cabinet full of jewels and miniatures
for the present i will content myself with those articles that can be conveniently removed
i will therefore ask you to pack them carefully and ship them to me charges prepaid to the station at batignolles within eight days otherwise i shall be obliged to remove them myself during the night of  september but under those circumstances i shall not content myself with the articles above mentioned
accept my apologies for any inconvenience i may cause you and believe me to be your humble servant ars√®ne lupin
p please do not send the largest watteau
although you paid thirty thousand francs for it it is only a copy the original having been burned under the directoire by barras during a night of debauchery
i do not care for the louis xv chatelaine as i doubt its authenticity
that letter completely upset the baron
had it borne any other signature he would have been greatly alarmed but signed by ars√®ne lupin
as an habitual reader of the newspapers he was versed in the history of recent crimes and was therefore well acquainted with the exploits of the mysterious burglar
of course he knew that lupin had been arrested in america by his enemy ganimard and was at present incarcerated in the prison de la sant√©
but he knew also that any miracle might be expected from ars√®ne lupin
moreover that exact knowledge of the castle the location of the pictures and furniture gave the affair an alarming aspect
how could he have acquired that information concerning things that no one had ever seen
the baron raised his eyes and contemplated the stern outlines of the castle its steep rocky pedestal the depth of the surrounding water and shrugged his shoulders
no one in the world could force an entrance to the sanctuary that contained his priceless treasures
no one perhaps but ars√®ne lupin
for him gates walls and drawbridges did not exist
what use were the most formidable obstacles or the most careful precautions if ars√®ne lupin had decided to effect an entrance
that evening he wrote to the procurer of the republique at rouen
he enclosed the threatening letter and solicited aid and protection
the reply came at once to the effect that ars√®ne lupin was in custody in the prison de la sant√© under close surveillance with no opportunity to write such a letter which was no doubt the work of some imposter
but as an act of precaution the procurer had submitted the letter to an expert in handwriting who declared that in spite of certain resemblances the writing was not that of the prisoner
but the words in spite of certain resemblances caught the attention of the baron in them he read the possibility of a doubt which appeared to him quite sufficient to warrant the intervention of the law
he read lupin s letter over and over again
i shall be obliged to remove them myself
and then there was the fixed date the night of  september
to confide in his servants was a proceeding repugnant to his nature but now for the first time in many years he experienced the necessity of seeking counsel with some one
abandoned by the legal official of his own district and feeling unable to defend himself with his own resources he was on the point of going to paris to engage the services of a detective
two days passed on the third day he was filled with hope and joy as he read the following item in the reveil de caudebec a newspaper published in a neighboring town we have the pleasure of entertaining in our city at the present time the veteran detective mon
ganimard who acquired a reputation by his clever capture of ars√®ne lupin
he has come here for rest and recreation and being an enthusiastic fisherman he threatens to capture all the fish in our ganimard
ah here is the assistance desired by baron cahorn
who could baffle the schemes of ars√®ne lupin better than ganimard the patient and astute detective
the town of caudebec was only six kilometers from the castle a short distance to a man whose step was accelerated by the hope of safety
after several fruitless attempts to ascertain the detective s address the baron visited the office of the reveil situated on the quai
there he found the writer of the article who approaching the window exclaimed ganimard
why you are sure to see him somewhere on the quai with his
i met him there and chanced to read his name engraved on his rod
ah there he is now under the trees
that little man wearing a straw hat exactly
he is a gruff fellow with little to say
five minutes later the baron approached the celebrated ganimard introduced himself and sought to commence a conversation but that was a failure
then he broached the real object of his interview and briefly stated his case
the other listened motionless with his attention riveted on his
when the baron had finished his story the fisherman turned with an air of profound pity and said monsieur it is not customary for thieves to warn people they are about to rob
ars√®ne lupin especially would not commit such a folly
but monsieur if i had the least doubt believe me the pleasure of again capturing ars√®ne lupin would place me at your disposal
but unfortunately that young man is already under lock and key
no one ever escaped from the sant√©
but he he no more than any other
yet well if he escapes so much the better
meanwhile you go home and sleep soundly
the baron returned to the castle reassured to some extent by ganimard s indifference
he examined the bolts watched the servants and during the next hours he became almost persuaded that his fears were groundless
certainly as ganimard had said thieves do not warn people they are about to rob
the fateful day was close at hand
it was now the of september and nothing had happened
but at three o clock the bell rang
a boy brought this telegram no goods at batignolles station
prepare everything for tomorrow night
this telegram threw the baron into such a state of excitement that he even considered the advisability of yielding to lupin s demands
however he hastened to caudebec
ganimard was fishing at the same place seated on a campstool
without a word he handed him the telegram
well what of it said the detective
ganimard laid down his turned to the baron and exclaimed in a tone of impatience ah
do you think i am going to bother myself about such a silly story as that
how much do you ask to pass tomorrow night in the castle
this offer disconcerted ganimard who replied calmly i am here on a vacation
i have no right to undertake such work
the detective after a moment s reflection said very well
but i must warn you that you are throwing your money out of the window
but after all what do we know about this devil lupin
he may have quite a numerous band of robbers with him
my faith better not count on them
i will telegraph for two of my men to help me
it is better for us not to be seen together
tomorrow evening about nine o clock
the following day the date fixed by ars√®ne lupin baron cahorn arranged all his panoply of war furbished his weapons and like a sentinel paced to and fro in front of the castle
at eight o clock in the evening he dismissed his servants
they occupied rooms in a wing of the building in a retired spot well removed from the main portion of the castle
shortly thereafter the baron heard the sound of approaching footsteps
it was ganimard and his two assistants great powerful fellows with immense hands and necks like bulls
after asking a few questions relating to the location of the various entrances and rooms ganimard carefully closed and barricaded all the doors and windows through which one could gain access to the threatened rooms
he inspected the walls raised the tapestries and finally installed his assistants in the central gallery which was located between the two salons
at the slightest sound open the windows of the court and call me
ten metres of perpendicular rock is no obstacle to those devils
ganimard locked his assistants in the gallery carried away the keys and said to the baron
he had chosen for himself a small room located in the thick outer wall between the two principal doors and which in former years had been the watchman s quarters
a opened upon the bridge another on the court
in one corner there was an opening to a tunnel
i believe you told me monsieur le baron that this tunnel is the only subterranean entrance to the castle and that it has been closed up for time immemorial
then unless there is some other entrance known only to ars√®ne lupin we are quite safe
he placed three chairs together stretched himself upon them lighted his pipe and sighed really monsieur le baron i feel ashamed to accept your money for such a sinecure as this
i will tell the story to my friend lupin
he was anxiously listening but heard nothing save the beating of his own heart
from time to time he leaned over the tunnel and cast a fearful eye into its depths
he heard the clock strike eleven twelve one
suddenly he seized ganimard s arm
the latter leaped up awakened from his sleep
ah yes it is the horn of an automobile
it is very improbable that lupin would use an automobile like a to demolish your castle
come monsieur le baron return to your post
ganimard resumed his interrupted slumbers and the baron heard nothing except the regular snoring of his companion
at break of day they left the room
the castle was enveloped in a profound calm it was a peaceful dawn on the bosom of a tranquil river
they mounted the stairs cahorn radiant with joy ganimard calm as usual
they heard no sound they saw nothing to arouse suspicion
what did i tell you monsieur le baron
really i should not have accepted your offer
he unlocked the door and entered the gallery
upon two chairs with drooping heads and pendent arms the detective s two assistants were asleep
tonnerre de nom d un chien exclaimed ganimard
at the same moment the baron cried out the pictures
he stammered choked with arms outstretched toward the empty places toward the denuded walls where naught remained but the useless nails and cords
the cabinets despoiled of their jewels
and the regent chandelier and my virgin
he ran from one spot to another in wildest despair
he recalled the purchase price of each article added up the figures counted his losses in confused words and unfinished phrases
he stamped with rage he groaned with grief
he acted like a ruined man whose only hope is suicide
if anything could have consoled him it would have been the stupefaction displayed by ganimard
the famous detective did not move
he appeared to be petrified he examined the room in a listless manner
not a break in the ceiling not a hole in the floor
everything was in perfect order
the theft had been carried out methodically according to a logical and inexorable plan
suddenly as if moved by anger he rushed upon his two assistants and shook them violently
he leaned over them and in turn examined them closely
they were asleep but their response was unnatural
they have been drugged he said to the baron
by whom by him of course or his men under his discretion
in that case i am lost nothing can be done
you represent the law and at this moment when you should be looking for a clue and trying to discover something you do not even stir
discover something with ars√®ne lupin
why my dear monsieur ars√®ne lupin never leaves any clue behind him
sometimes i think he put himself in my way and simply allowed me to arrest him in america
then i must renounce my pictures
he has taken the gems of my collection
i would give a fortune to recover them
if there is no other way let him name his own price
ganimard regarded the baron attentively as he said now that is sensible
we will discuss it later if the official examination does not succeed
but not one word about me if you wish my assistance
he added between his teeth it is true i have nothing to boast of in this affair
the assistants were gradually regaining consciousness with the bewildered air of people who come out of an hypnotic sleep
they opened their eyes and looked about them in astonishment
ganimard questioned them they remembered nothing
but you must have seen some one
they considered a moment and then one of them replied
it had no particular taste and no odor
come he said we are wasting our time here
one can t decide an ars√®ne lupin problem in five minutes
the same day a charge of burglary was duly performed by baron cahorn against ars√®ne lupin a prisoner in the prison de la sant√©
the baron afterwards regretted making the charge against lupin when he saw his castle delivered over to the gendarmes the procureur the judge d instruction the newspaper reporters and photographers and a throng of idle
the affair soon became a topic of general discussion and the name of ars√®ne lupin excited the public imagination to such an extent that the newspapers filled their columns with the most fantastic stories of his exploits which found ready credence amongst their readers
but the letter of ars√®ne lupin that was published in the
echo de no once ever knew how the newspaper obtained it that letter in which baron cahorn was impudently warned of the coming theft caused considerable excitement
the most fabulous theories were advanced
some recalled the existence of the famous subterranean tunnels and that was the line of research pursued by the officers of the law who searched the house from top to bottom questioned every stone studied the wainscoting and the chimneys the and the girders in the ceilings
by the light of torches they examined the immense cellars where the lords of malaquis were wont to store their munitions and provisions
they sounded the rocky foundation to its very centre
they discovered no trace of a subterranean tunnel
but the eager public declared that the pictures and furniture could not vanish like so many ghosts
they are substantial material things and require doors and windows for their exits and their entrances and so do the people that remove them
how did they gain access to the castle
the police officers of rouen convinced of their own impotence solicited the assistance of the parisian detective force
dudouis chief of the s√ªret√© sent the best sleuths of the iron brigade
he himself spent hours at the castle but met with no success
then he sent for ganimard whose past services had proved so useful when all else failed
ganimard listened in silence to the instructions of his superior then shaking his head he said in my opinion it is useless to ransack the castle
the solution of the problem lies elsewhere
to support that theory we must admit his intervention
in fact i consider it quite certain
i grant you that ars√®ne lupin is in prison closely guarded but he must have fetters on his feet manacles on his wrists and gag in his mouth before i change my opinion
because ars√®ne lupin is the only man in france of sufficient calibre to invent and carry out a scheme of that magnitude
searching for subterranean passages stones swinging on pivots and other nonsense of that kind
but lupin doesn t employ such methods
he is a modern cracksman right up to date
i should ask your permission to spend an hour with him
during the return trip from america we became very friendly and i venture to say that if he can give me any information without compromising himself he will not hesitate to save me from incurring useless trouble
it was shortly after noon when ganimard entered the cell of ars√®ne lupin
the latter who was lying on his bed raised his head and uttered a cry of apparent joy
in my chosen retreat i have felt a desire for many things but my fondest wish was to receive you here
you know i hold you in the highest regard
i have always said ganimard is our best detective
he is almost you see how candid i am he is almost as clever as sherlock holmes
but i am sorry that i can not offer you anything better than this hard stool
of course you will excuse me as i am here only temporarily
ganimard smiled and accepted the proffered seat
then the prisoner continued mon dieu how pleased i am to see the face of an honest man
i am so tired of those devils of spies who come here ten times a day to ransack my pockets and my cell to satisfy themselves that i am not preparing to escape
the government is very solicitous on my account
i should be quite contented if they would allow me to live in my own quiet way
but here i am joking and you are no doubt in a hurry
so let us come to business ganimard
to what do i owe the honor of this visit
the cahorn affair declared ganimard frankly
you see i have had so many affairs
first let me fix in my mind the circumstances of this particular case
the cahorn affair malaquis castle two rubens a watteau and a few trifling trifling
oh ma foi all that is of slight importance
but it suffices to know that the affair interests you
must i explain to you what steps the authorities have taken in the matter
i have read the newspapers and i will frankly state that you have made very little progress
and that is the reason i have come to see you
in the first place the cahorn affair was managed by you
i ought to have the receipts somewhere
ars√®ne opened the drawer of a small table of plain white wood which with the bed and stool constituted all the furniture in his cell and took therefrom two scraps of paper which he handed to ganimard
ah exclaimed the detective in surprise i thought you were closely guarded and searched and i find that you read the newspapers and collect postal receipts
they open the lining of my vest they examine the soles of my shoes they sound the walls of my cell but they never imagine that ars√®ne lupin would be foolish enough to choose such a simple hiding place
ganimard laughed as he said what a droll fellow you are
but come now tell me about the cahorn affair
you would rob me of all my secrets expose all my little tricks
was i wrong to count on your complaisance
no ganimard and since you insist ars√®ne lupin paced his cell two or three times then stopping before ganimard he asked what do you think of my letter to the baron
i think you were amusing yourself by playing to the gallery
come ganimard i thought you knew me better
do i ars√®ne lupin ever waste my time on such puerilities
would i have written that letter if i could have robbed the baron without writing to him
i want you to understand that the letter was indispensable it was the motor that set the whole machine in motion
now let us discuss together a scheme for the robbery of the malaquis castle
well let us suppose a castle carefully closed and barricaded like that of the baron cahorn
am i to abandon my scheme and renounce the treasures that i covet upon the pretext that the castle which holds them is inaccessible
should i make an assault upon the castle at the head of a band of adventurers as they did in ancient times
can i gain admittance by stealth or cunning
then there is only one way open to me
i must have the owner of the castle invite me to it
that is surely an original method
let us suppose that one day the owner receives a letter warning him that a notorious burglar known as ars√®ne lupin is plotting to rob him
who will laugh at him the said ars√®ne lupin is actually in
then in his anxiety and fear the simple man will ask the assistance of the will he not very likely
and if he happens to read in a country newspaper that a celebrated detective is spending his vacation in a neighboring town he will seek that detective
but on the other hand let us presume that having foreseen that state of affairs the said ars√®ne lupin has requested one of his friends to visit caudebec make the acquaintance of the editor of the r√©veil a newspaper to which the baron is a subscriber and let said editor understand that such person is the celebrated detective then what will happen
the editor will announce in the r√©veil the presence in caudebec of said detective
exactly and one of two things will happen either the fish i mean cahorn will not bite and nothing will happen or what is more likely he will run and greedily swallow the bait
thus behold my baron cahorn imploring the assistance of one of my friends against me
of course the at first refuses to give any assistance
on top of that comes the telegram from ars√®ne lupin
the frightened baron rushes once more to my friend and offers him a definite sum of money for his services
my friend accepts and summons two members of our band who during the night whilst cahorn is under the watchful eye of his protector removes certain articles by way of the window and lowers them with ropes into a nice little launch chartered for the occasion
the boldness of the scheme and the ingenuity of all its details are beyond criticism
but who is the detective whose name and fame served as a magnet to attract the baron and draw him into your net
there is only one name could do it only one
and that is ars√®ne lupin s personal enemy the most illustrious ganimard
if you go there and the baron decides to talk you will find that it will be your duty to arrest yourself just as you arrested me in america
the revenge is really amusing i cause ganimard to arrest ganimard
the detective greatly vexed bit his lips to him the joke was quite devoid of humor
the arrival of a prison guard gave ganimard an opportunity to recover himself
the man brought ars√®ne lupin s luncheon furnished by a neighboring restaurant
after depositing the tray upon the table the guard retired
lupin broke his bread ate a few morsels and continued but rest easy my dear ganimard you will not go to malaquis
i can tell you something that will astonish you the cahorn affair is on the point of being settled
excuse me i have just seen the chief of the suret√©
dudouis know my business better than i do myself
you will learn that ganimard excuse me that the still remains on very good terms with the baron
the latter has authorized him to negotiate a very delicate transaction with me and at the present moment in consideration of a certain sum it is probable that the baron has recovered possession of his pictures and other treasures
and on their return he will withdraw his complaint
thus there is no longer any theft and the law must abandon the case
ganimard regarded the prisoner with a bewildered air
i have just received the telegram i was expecting
you have just received a telegram
this very moment my dear friend
out of politeness i did not wish to read it in your presence
but if you will permit me you are joking lupin
my dear friend if you will be so kind as to break that egg you will learn for yourself that i am not joking
mechanically ganimard obeyed and cracked the with the blade of a knife
the shell contained nothing but a small piece of blue paper
at the request of ars√®ne he unfolded it
it was a telegram or rather a portion of a telegram from which the had been removed
it read as follows contract closed
hundred thousand balls delivered
one hundred thousand balls said ganimard
yes one hundred thousand francs
very little but then you know these are hard times
and i have some heavy bills to meet
if you only knew my budget living in the city comes very high
he reflected for a moment glancing over the whole affair in an effort to discover a weak point then in a tone and manner that betrayed his admiration of the prisoner he said fortunately we do not have a dozen such as you to deal with if we did we would have to close up shop
ars√®ne lupin assumed a modest air as he replied bah a person must have some diversion to occupy his leisure hours especially when he is in prison
exclaimed ganimard your trial your defense the examination isn t that sufficient to occupy your mind
no because i have decided not to be present at my trial
ars√®ne lupin repeated positively i shall not be present at my trial
ah my dear monsieur do you suppose i am going to rot upon the wet straw
ars√®ne lupin remains in prison just as long as it pleases him and not one minute more
perhaps it would have been more prudent if you had avoided getting there said the detective ironically
monsieur must remember that he had the honor to effect my arrest
know then my worthy friend that no one not even you could have placed a hand upon me if a much more important event had not occupied my attention at that critical moment
a woman was looking at me ganimard and i loved her
do you fully understand what that means to be under the eyes of a woman that one loves
i cared for nothing in the world but that
permit me to say you have been here a long time
in the first place i wished to forget
do not laugh it was a delightful adventure and it is still a tender memory
besides i have been suffering from neurasthenia
life is so feverish these days that it is necessary to take the rest cure occasionally and i find this spot a sovereign remedy for my tired nerves
ars√®ne lupin you are not a bad fellow after all
on wednesday next at four o clock in the afternoon i will smoke my cigar at your house in the rue pergolese
they shook hands like two old friends who valued each other at their true worth then the detective stepped to the door
asked ganimard as he turned back
he returned the watch excusing himself
because they have taken mine is no reason why i should take yours
besides i have a chronometer here that satisfies me fairly well
he took from the drawer a large gold watch and heavy chain
from whose pocket did that come asked ganimard
ars√®ne lupin gave a hasty glance at the initials engraved on the watch
jules bouvier the judge who conducted my examination
the escape of ars√®ne lupin ars√®ne lupin had just finished his repast and taken from his pocket an excellent cigar with a gold band which he was examining with unusual care when the door of his cell was opened
he had barely time to throw the cigar into the drawer and move away from the table
i was waiting for you my dear boy exclaimed lupin in his accustomed good humor
as soon as they had disappeared at a turn in the corridor two men entered the cell and commenced a minute examination of it
one was inspector dieuzy the other was inspector folenfant
they wished to verify their suspicion that ars√®ne lupin was in communication with his accomplices outside of the prison
on the preceding evening the grand journal had published these lines addressed to its court reporter monsieur in a recent article you referred to me in most unjustifiable terms
some days before the opening of my trial i will call you to account
the handwriting was certainly that of ars√®ne lupin
consequently he sent letters and no doubt received letters
it was certain that he was preparing for that escape thus arrogantly announced by him
the situation had become intolerable
acting in conjunction with the examining judge the chief of the s√ªret√© mon
dudouis had visited the prison and instructed the gaoler in regard to the precautions necessary to insure lupin s safety
at the same time he sent the two men to examine the prisoner s cell
they raised every stone ransacked the bed did everything customary in such a case but they discovered nothing and were about to abandon their investigation when the guard entered hastily and said the drawer look in the
when i entered just now he was closing it
they opened the drawer and dieuzy exclaimed
the chief will want to make an inventory
leave it there and notify the chief
dudouis examined the contents of the drawer
first he discovered a bundle of newspaper clippings relating to ars√®ne lupin taken from the
argus de la then a a pipe some paper called and two books
he read the titles of the books
one was an english edition of carlyle s the other was a charming elzevir in modern binding the manual of epictetus a german translation published at leyden in
on examining the books he found that all the pages were underlined and annotated
were they prepared as a code for correspondence or did they simply express the studious character of the reader
then he examined the and the pipe
finally he took up the famous cigar with its gold band
with the mechanical action of an habitual smoker he placed the cigar close to his ear and squeezed it to make it crack
immediately he uttered a cry of surprise
the cigar had yielded under the pressure of his fingers
he examined it more closely and quickly discovered something white between the leaves of tobacco
delicately with the aid of a pin he withdrew a roll of very thin paper scarcely larger than a toothpick
he unrolled it and found these words written in a feminine handwriting
the basket has taken the place of the others
on pressing the outer foot the plate goes downward
from twelve to sixteen every day will wait
rest easy your friend is watching over you
dudouis reflected a moment then said it is quite clear the basket
from twelve to sixteen means from twelve to four o clock
but this that will wait must mean automobile
horsepower is the way they indicate strength of the motor
a is an automobile of horsepower
then he rose and asked had the prisoner finished his breakfast
and as he has not yet read the message which is proved by the condition of the cigar it is probable that he had just received it
concealed in his bread or in a potato perhaps
his food was allowed to be brought in simply to trap him but we have never found anything in it
we will look for lupin s reply this evening
detain him outside for a few minutes
i shall take this to the examining judge and if he agrees with me we will have the letter photographed at once and in an hour you can replace the letter in the drawer in a cigar similar to this
the prisoner must have no cause for suspicion
it was not without a certain curiosity that mon
dudouis returned to the prison in the evening accompanied by inspector dieuzy
three empty plates were sitting on the stove in the corner
dieuzy please cut that macaroni into very small pieces and open that nothing no mon
dudouis examined the plates the fork the spoon and the knife an ordinary knife with a rounded blade
he turned the handle to the left then to the right
the knife was hollow and served as a for a sheet of paper
he said that is not very clever for a man like ars√®ne
you dieuzy go and search the restaurant
then he read the note i trust to you will follow at a distance every day
dudouis rubbing his hands gleefully
i think we have the affair in our own hands
a little strategy on our part and the escape will be a success in so far as the arrest of his confederates are concerned
but if ars√®ne lupin slips through your fingers suggested the guard
we will have a sufficient number of men to prevent that
if however he displays too much cleverness ma foi so much the worse for him
as to his band of robbers since the chief refuses to speak the others must
and as a matter of fact ars√®ne lupin had very little to say
jules bouvier the examining judge had exerted himself in vain
the investigation had been reduced to a few uninteresting arguments between the judge and the advocate ma√Ætre danval one of the leaders of the bar
from time to time through courtesy ars√®ne lupin would speak
one day he said yes monsieur le judge i quite agree with you the robbery of the cr√©dit lyonnais the theft in the rue de babylone the issue of the counterfeit the burglaries at the various ch√¢teaux armesnil gouret imblevain groseillers malaquis all my work monsieur i did it all
then will you explain to me it is useless
i confess everything in a lump everything and even ten times more than you know nothing about
wearied by his fruitless task the judge had suspended his examinations but he resumed them after the two intercepted messages were brought to his attention and regularly at ars√®ne lupin was taken from the prison to the d√©p√¥t in the with a certain number of other prisoners
they returned about three or four o clock
now one afternoon this return trip was made under unusual conditions
the other prisoners not having been examined it was decided to take back ars√®ne lupin first thus he found himself alone in the vehicle
these vulgarly called panniers √† salade or are divided lengthwise by a central corridor from which open ten compartments five on either side
each compartment is so arranged that the occupant must assume and retain a sitting posture and consequently the five prisoners are seated one upon the other and yet separated one from the other by partitions
a municipal guard standing at one end watches over the corridor
ars√®ne was placed in the third cell on the right and the heavy vehicle started
he carefully calculated when they left the quai de l horloge and when they passed the palais de justice
then about the centre of the bridge saint michel with his outer foot that is to say his right foot he pressed upon the metal plate that closed his cell
immediately something clicked and the metal plate moved
he was able to ascertain that he was located between the two wheels
the vehicle was proceeding slowly along the boulevard saint michel
at the corner of saint germain it stopped
the traffic having been interrupted a vast throng of fiacres and omnibuses had gathered there
another had stopped close to the one he occupied
he moved the plate still farther put his foot on one of the spokes of the wheel and leaped to the ground
a coachman saw him roared with laughter then tried to raise an outcry but his voice was lost in the noise of the traffic that had commenced to move again
moreover ars√®ne lupin was already far away
he had run for a few steps but once upon the sidewalk he turned and looked around he seemed to scent the wind like a person who is uncertain which direction to take
then having decided he put his hands in his pockets and with the careless air of an idle stroller he proceeded up the boulevard
it was a warm bright autumn day and the caf√©s were full
he took a seat on the terrace of one of them
he ordered a bock and a package of cigarettes
he emptied his glass slowly smoked one cigarette and lighted a second
then he asked the waiter to send the proprietor to him
when the proprietor came ars√®ne spoke to him in a voice loud enough to be heard by everyone i regret to say monsieur i have forgotten my pocketbook
perhaps on the strength of my name you will be pleased to give me credit for a few days
the proprietor looked at him thinking he was joking
but ars√®ne repeated lupin prisoner at the sant√© but now a fugitive
i venture to assume that the name inspires you with perfect confidence in me
and he walked away amidst shouts of laughter whilst the proprietor stood amazed
lupin strolled along the rue soufflot and turned into the rue saint jacques
he pursued his way slowly smoking his cigarettes and looking into the
at the boulevard de port royal he took his bearings discovered where he was and then walked in the direction of the rue de la sant√©
the high forbidding walls of the prison were now before him
he pulled his hat forward to shade his face then approaching the sentinel he asked is this the prison de la sant√©
the van left me on the way and i would not abuse now young man move along quick
pardon me but i must pass through that gate
and if you prevent ars√®ne lupin from entering the prison it will cost you dear my friend
i am sorry i haven t a card with me said ars√®ne fumbling in his pockets
the sentinel eyed him from head to foot in astonishment
then without a word he rang a bell
the iron gate was partly opened and ars√®ne stepped inside
almost immediately he encountered the keeper of the prison gesticulating and feigning a violent anger
ars√®ne smiled and said come monsieur don t play that game with me
they take the precaution to carry me alone in the van prepare a nice little obstruction and imagine i am going to take to my heels and rejoin my friends
well and what about the twenty agents of the s√ªret√© who accompanied us on foot in fiacres and on bicycles
no the arrangement did not please me
i should not have got away alive
tell me monsieur did they count on that
he shrugged his shoulders and added i beg of you monsieur not to worry about me
when i wish to escape i shall not require any assistance
on the second day thereafter the de which had apparently become the official reporter of the exploits of ars√®ne lupin it was said that he was one of its principal shareholders published a most complete account of this attempted escape
the exact wording of the messages exchanged between the prisoner and his mysterious friend the means by which correspondence was constructed the complicity of the police the promenade on the boulevard saint michel the incident at the caf√© soufflot everything was disclosed
it was known that the search of the restaurant and its waiters by inspector dieuzy had been fruitless
and the public also learned an extraordinary thing which demonstrated the infinite variety of resources that lupin possessed the in which he was being carried was prepared for the occasion and substituted by his accomplices for one of the six vans which did service at the prison
the next escape of ars√®ne lupin was not doubted by anyone
he announced it himself in categorical terms in a reply to mon
bouvier on the day following his attempted escape
the judge having made a jest about the affair ars√®ne was annoyed and firmly eyeing the judge he said emphatically listen to me monsieur
i give you my word of honor that this attempted flight was simply preliminary to my general plan of escape
i do not understand said the judge
it is not necessary that you should understand
and when the judge in the course of that examination which was reported at length in the columns of the de when the judge sought to resume his investigation ars√®ne lupin exclaimed with an assumed air of lassitude mon dieu mon dieu what s the use
all these questions are of no importance
no because i shall not be present at the trial
no i have fully decided on that and nothing will change my mind
such assurance combined with the inexplicable indiscretions that ars√®ne committed every day served to annoy and mystify the officers of the law
there were secrets known only to ars√®ne lupin secrets that he alone could divulge
but for what purpose did he reveal them
ars√®ne lupin was changed to another cell
the judge closed his preliminary investigation
no further proceedings were taken in his case for a period of two months during which time ars√®ne was seen almost constantly lying on his bed with his face turned toward the wall
the changing of his cell seemed to discourage him
he exchanged only a few necessary words with his keepers
during the fortnight preceding his trial he resumed his vigorous life
consequently early every morning he was allowed to exercise in the courtyard guarded by two men
public curiosity had not died out every day it expected to be regaled with news of his escape and it is true he had gained a considerable amount of public sympathy by reason of his verve his gayety his diversity his inventive genius and the mystery of his life
the public expected it and was surprised that the event had been delayed so long
every morning the pr√©fect of police asked his secretary well has he escaped yet
and on the day before the trial a gentleman called at the office of the grand journal asked to see the court reporter threw his card in the reporter s face and walked rapidly away
these words were written on the card ars√®ne lupin always keeps his promises
it was under these conditions that the trial commenced
an enormous crowd gathered at the court
everybody wished to see the famous ars√®ne lupin
they had a gleeful anticipation that the prisoner would play some audacious pranks upon the judge
advocates and magistrates reporters and men of the world actresses and society women were crowded together on the benches provided for the public
it was a dark sombre day with a steady downpour of rain
only a dim light pervaded the courtroom and the spectators caught a very indistinct view of the prisoner when the guards brought him in
but his heavy shambling walk the manner in which he dropped into his seat and his passive stupid appearance were not at all prepossessing
several times his advocate one of mon
danval s assistants spoke to him but he simply shook his head and said nothing
the clerk read the indictment then the judge spoke prisoner at the bar stand up
your name age and occupation not receiving any reply the judge repeated your name
a thick slow voice muttered baudru d√©sir√©
a murmur of surprise pervaded the courtroom
but the judge proceeded baudru d√©sir√©
well as you have already assumed a dozen different names and this one is no doubt as imaginary as the others we will adhere to the name of ars√®ne lupin by which you are more generally known
the judge referred to his notes and continued for despite the most diligent search your past history remains unknown
your case is unique in the annals of crime
we know not whom you are whence you came your birth and breeding all is a mystery to us
three years ago you appeared in our midst as ars√®ne lupin presenting to us a strange combination of intelligence and perversion immorality and generosity
our knowledge of your life prior to that date is vague and problematical
it may be that the man called rostat who eight years ago worked with dickson the prestidigitator was none other than ars√®ne lupin
it is probable that the russian student who six years ago attended the laboratory of doctor altier at the saint louis hospital and who often astonished the doctor by the ingenuity of his hypotheses on subjects of bacteriology and the boldness of his experiments in diseases of the skin was none other than ars√®ne lupin
it is probable also that ars√®ne lupin was the professor who introduced the japanese art of to the parisian public
we have some reason to believe that ars√®ne lupin was the bicyclist who won the grand prix de l exposition received his ten thousand francs and was never heard of again
ars√®ne lupin may have been also the person who saved so many lives through the little at the charity bazaar and at the same time picked their pockets
the judge paused for a moment then continued such is that epoch which seems to have been utilized by you in a thorough preparation for the warfare you have since waged against society a methodical apprenticeship in which you developed your strength energy and skill to the highest point possible
do you acknowledge the accuracy of these facts
during this discourse the prisoner had stood balancing himself first on one foot then on the other with shoulders stooped and arms inert
under the strongest light one could observe his extreme thinness his hollow cheeks his projecting his face dotted with small red spots and framed in a rough straggling beard
prison life had caused him to age and wither
he had lost the youthful face and elegant figure we had seen portrayed so often in the newspapers
it appeared as if he had not heard the question propounded by the judge
then he raised his eyes seemed to reflect then making a desperate effort he murmured baudru d√©sir√©
the judge smiled as he said i do not understand the theory of your defense ars√®ne lupin
if you are seeking to avoid responsibility for your crimes on the ground of imbecility such a line of defense is open to you
but i shall proceed with the trial and pay no heed to your vagaries
he then narrated at length the various thefts swindles and forgeries charged against lupin
sometimes he questioned the prisoner but the latter simply grunted or remained silent
the examination of witnesses commenced
some of the evidence given was immaterial other portions of it seemed more important but through all of it there ran a vein of contradictions and inconsistencies
a wearisome obscurity enveloped the proceedings until detective ganimard was called as a witness then interest was revived
from the beginning the actions of the veteran detective appeared strange and unaccountable
several times he looked at the prisoner with obvious doubt and anxiety
then with his hands resting on the rail in front of him he recounted the events in which he had participated including his pursuit of the prisoner across europe and his arrival in america
he was listened to with great avidity as his capture of ars√®ne lupin was well known to everyone through the medium of the press
toward the close of his testimony after referring to his conversations with ars√®ne lupin he stopped twice embarrassed and undecided
it was apparent that he was possessed of some thought which he feared to utter
the judge said to him sympathetically if you are ill you may retire for the present
no no but he stopped looked sharply at the prisoner and said i ask permission to scrutinize the prisoner at closer range
there is some mystery about him that i must solve
he approached the accused man examined him attentively for several minutes then returned to the and in an almost solemn voice he said i declare on oath that the prisoner now before me is not ars√®ne lupin
a profound silence followed the statement
the judge nonplused for a moment exclaimed ah
the detective continued at first sight there is a certain resemblance but if you carefully consider the nose the mouth the hair the color of skin you will see that it is not ars√®ne lupin
did he ever have those alcoholic eyes
do you pretend to say that we are trying the wrong man
ars√®ne lupin has in some manner contrived to put this poor devil in his place unless this man is a willing accomplice
this dramatic d√©nouement caused much laughter and excitement amongst the spectators
the judge adjourned the trial and sent for mon
bouvier the gaoler and guards employed in the prison
bouvier and the gaoler examined the accused and declared that there was only a very slight resemblance between the prisoner and ars√®ne lupin
well then exclaimed the judge who is this man
two of the were called and both of them declared that the prisoner was ars√®ne lupin
but one of the guards then said yes yes i think it is he
what cried the judge impatiently you think
well i saw very little of the prisoner
he was placed in my charge in the evening and for two months he seldom stirred but laid on his bed with his face to the wall
what about the time prior to those two months before that he occupied a cell in another part of the prison
here the head gaoler interrupted and said we changed him to another cell after his attempted escape
but you monsieur you have seen him during those two months
he was always quiet and orderly
and this prisoner is not ars√®ne lupin
then we have before us a man who was substituted for ars√®ne lupin two months ago
in absolute despair the judge turned to the accused and addressed him in a conciliatory tone prisoner can you tell me how and since when you became an inmate of the prison de la sant√©
the engaging manner of the judge was calculated to disarm the mistrust and awaken the understanding of the accused man
finally under clever and gentle questioning he succeeded in framing a few phrases from which the following story was gleaned two months ago he had been taken to the d√©p√¥t examined and released
as he was leaving the building a free man he was seized by two guards and placed in the
since then he had occupied cell
he was contented there plenty to eat and he slept well so he did not complain
all that seemed probable and amidst the mirth and excitement of the spectators the judge adjourned the trial until the story could be investigated and verified
the following facts were at once established by an examination of the prison records eight weeks before a man named baudru d√©sir√© had slept at the d√©p√¥t
he was released the next day and left the d√©p√¥t at two o clock in the afternoon
on the same day at two o clock having been examined for the last time ars√®ne lupin left the d√©p√¥t in a
had they been deceived by the resemblance and carelessly substituted this man for their prisoner
another question suggested itself had the substitution been arranged in advance
in that event baudru must have been an accomplice and must have caused his own arrest for the express purpose of taking lupin s place
but then by what miracle had such a plan based on a series of improbable chances been carried to success
baudru d√©sir√© was turned over to the anthropological service they had never seen anything like him
however they easily traced his past history
he was known at courbevois at asni√®res and at levallois
he lived on alms and slept in one of those s huts near the barrier de ternes
he had disappeared from there a year ago
had he been enticed away by ars√®ne lupin
there was no evidence to that effect
and even if that was so it did not explain the flight of the prisoner
amongst twenty theories which sought to explain it not one was satisfactory
of the escape itself there was no doubt an escape that was incomprehensible sensational in which the public as well as the officers of the law could detect a carefully prepared plan a combination of circumstances marvelously whereof the d√©nouement fully justified the confident prediction of ars√®ne lupin i shall not be present at my trial
after a month of patient investigation the problem remained unsolved
the poor devil of a baudru could not be kept in prison indefinitely and to place him on trial would be ridiculous
there was no charge against him
consequently he was released but the chief of the s√ªr√©t√© resolved to keep him under surveillance
this idea originated with ganimard
from his point of view there was neither complicity nor chance
baudru was an instrument upon which ars√®ne lupin had played with his extraordinary skill
baudru when set at liberty would lead them to ars√®ne lupin or at least to some of his accomplices
the two inspectors folenfant and dieuzy were assigned to assist ganimard
one foggy morning in january the prison gates opened and baudru d√©sir√© stepped forth a free man
at first he appeared to be quite embarrassed and walked like a person who has no precise idea whither he is going
he followed the rue de la sant√© and the rue saint jacques
he stopped in front of an shop removed his jacket and his vest sold his vest on which he realized a few sous then replacing his jacket he proceeded on his way
at the ch√¢telet an omnibus passed him
he wished to enter it but there was no place
the controller advised him to secure a number so he entered the
ganimard called to his two assistants and without removing his eyes from the waiting room he said to them stop a carriage
i will go with one of you and we will follow him
idiot that i am he muttered i forgot there was another exit
there was an interior corridor extending from the to the rue saint martin
ganimard rushed through it and arrived just in time to observe baudru upon the top of the de plates omnibus as it was turning the corner of the rue de rivoli
but he had lost his two assistants
he must continue the pursuit alone
in his anger he was inclined to seize the man by the collar without ceremony
was it not with premeditation and by means of an ingenious ruse that his pretended imbecile had separated him from his assistants
the latter was asleep on the bench his head rolling from side to side his mouth and an incredible expression of stupidity on his blotched face
no such an adversary was incapable of deceiving old ganimard
it was a stroke of luck nothing more
at the the man leaped from the omnibus and took the la muette tramway following the boulevard haussmann and the avenue victor hugo
baudru alighted at la muette station and with a nonchalant air strolled into the bois de boulogne
he wandered through one path after another and sometimes retraced his steps
at the end of an hour he appeared to be faint from fatigue and noticing a bench he sat down
the spot not far from auteuil on the edge of a pond hidden amongst the trees was absolutely deserted
after the lapse of another ganimard became impatient and resolved to speak to the man
he approached and took a seat beside baudru lighted a cigarette traced some figures in the sand with the end of his cane and said it s a pleasant day
but suddenly the man burst into laughter a happy mirthful laugh spontaneous and irresistible
ganimard felt his hair stand on end in horror and surprise
it was that laugh that infernal laugh he knew so well
with a sudden movement he seized the man by the collar and looked at him with a keen penetrating gaze and found that he no longer saw the man baudru
to be sure he saw baudru but at the same time he saw the other the real man lupin
he discovered the intense life in the eyes he filled up the shrunken features he perceived the real flesh beneath the flabby skin the real mouth through the grimaces that deformed it
those were the eyes and mouth of the other and especially his keen alert mocking expression so clear and youthful
ars√®ne lupin ars√®ne lupin he stammered
then in a sudden fit of rage he seized lupin by the throat and tried to hold him down
in spite of his fifty years he still possessed unusual strength whilst his adversary was apparently in a weak condition
but the struggle was a brief one
ars√®ne lupin made only a slight movement and as suddenly as he had made the attack ganimard released his hold
his right arm fell inert useless
if you had taken lessons in at the quai des orf√®vres said lupin you would know that that blow is called in japanese
a second more and i would have broken your arm and that would have been just what you deserve
i am surprised that you an old friend whom i respect and before whom i voluntarily expose my incognito should abuse my confidence in that violent manner
that escape for which he deemed himself responsible was it not he ganimard who by his sensational evidence had led the court into serious error
that escape appeared to him like a dark cloud on his professional career
a tear rolled down his cheek to his gray moustache
dieu ganimard don t take it to heart
if you had not spoken i would have arranged for some one else to do it
i couldn t allow poor baudru d√©sir√© to be convicted
then murmured ganimard it was you that was there
it is i always i only can it be possible
oh it is not the work of a sorcerer
simply as the judge remarked at the trial the apprenticeship of a dozen years that equips a man to cope successfully with all the obstacles in life
your eyes you can understand that if i worked eighteen months with doctor altier at the hospital it was not out of love for the work
i considered that he who would one day have the honor of calling himself ars√®ne lupin ought to be exempt from the ordinary laws governing appearance and identity
for instance a hypodermic injection of paraffine will puff up the skin at the desired spot
pyrogallic acid will change your skin to that of an indian
the juice of the greater celandine will adorn you with the most beautiful eruptions and tumors
another chemical affects the growth of your beard and hair another changes the tone of your voice
add to that two months of dieting in cell  exercises repeated a thousand times to enable me to hold my features in a certain grimace to carry my head at a certain inclination and adapt my back and shoulders to a stooping posture
then five drops of atropine in the eyes to make them haggard and wild and the trick is done
i do not understand how you deceived the guards
the evolution was so gradual that they failed to notice it
but baudru d√©sir√© baudru exists
he is a poor harmless fellow whom i met last year and really he bears a certain resemblance to me
considering my arrest as a possible event i took charge of baudru and studied the points wherein we differed in appearance with a view to correct them in my own person
my friends caused him to remain at the d√©p√¥t overnight and to leave there next day about the same hour as i did a coincidence easily arranged
of course it was necessary to have a record of his detention at the d√©p√¥t in order to establish the fact that such a person was a reality otherwise the police would have sought elsewhere to find out my identity
but in offering to them this excellent baudru it was inevitable you understand inevitable that they would seize upon him and despite the insurmountable difficulties of a substitution they would prefer to believe in a substitution than confess their ignorance
yes yes of course said ganimard
and then exclaimed ars√®ne lupin i held in my hands a an anxious public watching and waiting for my escape
and that is the fatal error into which you fell you and the others in the course of that fascinating game pending between me and the officers of the law wherein the stake was my liberty
and you supposed that i was playing to the gallery that i was intoxicated with my success
i ars√®ne lupin guilty of such weakness
and no longer ago than the cahorn affair you said when ars√®ne lupin cries from the housetops that he will escape he has some object in view
but sapristi you must understand that in order to escape i must create in advance a public belief in that escape a belief amounting to an article of faith an absolute conviction a reality as glittering as the sun
and i did create that belief that ars√®ne lupin would escape that ars√®ne lupin would not be present at his trial
and when you gave your evidence and said that man is not ars√®ne lupin everybody was prepared to believe you
had one person doubted it had any one uttered this simple restriction suppose it is ars√®ne lupin from that moment i was lost
if anyone had scrutinized my face not imbued with the idea that i was not ars√®ne lupin as you and the others did at my trial but with the idea that i might be ars√®ne lupin then despite all my precautions i should have been recognized
logically psychologically no once could entertain the idea that i was ars√®ne lupin
come ganimard confess that on the wednesday after our conversation in the prison de la sant√© you expected me at your house at four o clock exactly as i said i would go
and your said ganimard evading the question
some of my friends secured that old unused van and wished to make the attempt
but i considered it impractical without the concurrence of a number of unusual circumstances
however i found it useful to carry out that attempted escape and give it the widest publicity
an audaciously planned escape though not completed gave to the succeeding one the character of reality simply by anticipation
so that the cigar hollowed by myself as well as the knife
and the mysterious correspondent did not exist
ganimard reflected a moment then said when the anthropological service had baudru s case under consideration why did they not perceive that his measurements coincided with those of ars√®ne lupin
my measurements are not in existence
i have given considerable attention to that question
in the first place the bertillon system records the visible marks of identification and you have seen that they are not infallible and after that the measurements of the head the fingers the ears etc
of course such measurements are more or less infallible
no but it costs money to get around them
before we left america one of the employees of the service there accepted so much money to insert false figures in my measurements
consequently baudru s measurements should not agree with those of ars√®ne lupin
after a short silence ganimard asked what are you going to do now
now replied lupin i am going to take a rest enjoy the best of food and drink and gradually recover my former healthy condition
it is all very well to become baudru or some other person on occasion and to change your personality as you do your shirt but you soon grow weary of the change
i feel exactly as i imagine the man who lost his shadow must have felt and i shall be glad to be ars√®ne lupin once more
he walked to and fro for a few minutes then stopping in front of ganimard he said you have nothing more to say i suppose
i should like to know if you intend to reveal the true state of facts connected with your escape
no one will ever know that it was ars√®ne lupin who was discharged
it is to my own interest to surround myself with mystery and therefore i shall permit my escape to retain its almost miraculous character
so have no fear on that score my dear friend
i am going out to dinner this evening and have only sufficient time to dress
ah there are duties to society that one can not avoid
the mysterious traveller the evening before i had sent my automobile to rouen by the highway
i was to travel to rouen by rail on my way to visit some friends that live on the banks of the seine
at paris a few minutes before the train started seven gentlemen entered my compartment five of them were smoking
no matter that the journey was a short one the thought of traveling with such a company was not agreeable to me especially as the car was built on the old model without a corridor
i picked up my overcoat my newspapers and my and sought refuge in a neighboring compartment
it was occupied by a lady who at sight of me made a gesture of annoyance that did not escape my notice and she leaned toward a gentleman who was standing on the step and was no doubt her husband
the gentleman scrutinized me closely and apparently my appearance did not displease him for he smiled as he spoke to his wife with the air of one who reassures a frightened child
she smiled also and gave me a friendly glance as if she now understood that i was one of those gallant men with whom a woman can remain shut up for two hours in a little box six feet square and have nothing to fear
her husband said to her i have an important appointment my dear and can not wait any longer
he kissed her affectionately and went away
his wife threw him a few kisses and waved her handkerchief
the whistle sounded and the train started
at that precise moment and despite the protests of the guards the door was opened and a man rushed into our compartment
my companion who was standing and arranging her luggage uttered a cry of terror and fell upon the seat
i am not a coward far from it but i confess that such intrusions at the last minute are always disconcerting
they have a suspicious unnatural aspect
however the appearance of the new arrival greatly modified the unfavorable impression produced by his precipitant action
he was correctly and elegantly dressed wore a tasteful cravat correct gloves and his face was refined and intelligent
but where the devil had i seen that face before
because beyond all possible doubt i had seen it
and yet the memory of it was so vague and indistinct that i felt it would be useless to try to recall it at that time
then directing my attention to the lady i was amazed at the pallor and anxiety i saw in her face
she was looking at her neighbor they occupied seats on the same side of the compartment with an expression of intense alarm and i perceived that one of her trembling hands was slowly gliding toward a little traveling bag that was lying on the seat about twenty inches from her
she finished by seizing it and nervously drawing it to her
our eyes met and i read in hers so much anxiety and fear that i could not refrain from speaking to her are you ill madame
her only reply was a gesture indicating that she was afraid of our companion
i smiled as her husband had done shrugged my shoulders and explained to her in pantomime that she had nothing to fear that i was there and besides the gentleman appeared to be a very harmless individual
at that moment he turned toward us scrutinized both of us from head to foot then settled down in his corner and paid us no more attention
after a short silence the lady as if she had mustered all her energy to perform a desperate act said to me in an almost inaudible voice do you know who is on our train who he he
she had not taken her eyes off our companion and it was to him rather than to me that she uttered the syllables of that disquieting name
was that to conceal his agitation or simply to arrange himself for sleep
then i said to her yesterday through contumacy ars√®ne lupin was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment at hard labor
therefore it is improbable that he would be so imprudent as to show himself in public
moreover the newspapers have announced his appearance in turkey since his escape from the sant√©
but he is on this train at the present moment the lady proclaimed with the obvious intention of being heard by our companion my husband is one of the directors in the penitentiary service and it was the stationmaster himself who told us that a search was being made for ars√®ne lupin
they may have been mistaken no he was seen in the
the guard at the door did not see him pass and it is supposed that he had got into the express that leaves ten minutes after us
in that case they will be sure to catch him
unless at the last moment he leaped from that train to come here into our train which is quite probable which is almost certain
if so he will be arrested just the same for the employees and guards would no doubt observe his passage from one train to the other and when we arrive at rouen they will arrest him there
he will find some means of escape
in that case i wish him bon voyage
but in the meantime think what he may do
she was greatly agitated and truly the situation justified to some extent her nervous excitement
i was impelled to say to her of course there are many strange coincidences but you need have no fear
admitting that ars√®ne lupin is on this train he will not commit any indiscretion he will be only too happy to escape the peril that already threatens him
my words did not reassure her but she remained silent for a time
i unfolded my newspapers and read reports of ars√®ne lupin s trial but as they contained nothing that was new to me i was not greatly interested
moreover i was tired and sleepy
i felt my eyelids close and my head drop
but monsieur you are not going to sleep
she seized my newspaper and looked at me with indignation
i looked through the window at the landscape and the fleeting clouds but in a short time all that became confused and indistinct the image of the nervous lady and the drowsy gentleman were effaced from my memory and i was buried in the soothing depths of a profound sleep
the tranquility of my response was soon disturbed by disquieting dreams wherein a creature that had played the part and bore the name of ars√®ne lupin held an important place
he appeared to me with his back laden with articles of value he leaped over walls and plundered castles
but the outlines of that creature who was no longer ars√®ne lupin assumed a more definite form
he came toward me growing larger and larger leaped into the compartment with incredible agility and landed squarely on my chest
with a cry of fright and pain i awoke
the man the traveller our companion with his knee on my breast held me by the throat
my sight was very indistinct for my eyes were suffused with blood
i could see the lady in a corner of the compartment convulsed with fright
besides i did not have the strength
my temples throbbed i was almost strangled
one minute more and i would have breathed my last
the man must have realized it for he relaxed his grip but did not remove his hand
then he took a cord in which he had prepared a and tied my wrists together
in an instant i was bound gagged and helpless
certainly he accomplished the trick with an ease and skill that revealed the hand of a master he was no doubt a professional thief
not a word not a nervous movement only coolness and audacity
and i was there lying on the bench bound like a mummy i ars√®ne lupin
it was anything but a laughing matter and yet despite the gravity of the situation i keenly appreciated the humor and irony that it involved
ars√®ne lupin seized and bound like a novice
robbed as if i were an unsophisticated rustic for you must understand the scoundrel had deprived me of my purse and wallet
ars√®ne lupin a victim duped vanquished
he contented himself with picking up her that had fallen to the floor and taking from it the jewels purse and gold and silver trinkets that it contained
the lady opened her eyes trembled with fear drew the rings from her fingers and handed them to the man as if she wished to spare him unnecessary trouble
he took the rings and looked at her
then quite unruffled he resumed his seat lighted a cigarette and proceeded to examine the treasure that he had acquired
the examination appeared to give him perfect satisfaction
but i was not so well satisfied
i do not speak of the twelve thousand francs of which i had been unduly deprived that was only a temporary loss because i was certain that i would recover possession of that money after a very brief delay together with the important papers contained in my wallet plans specifications addresses lists of correspondents and compromising letters
but for the moment a more immediate and more serious question troubled me how would this affair end
what would be the outcome of this adventure
as you can imagine the disturbance created by my passage through the station has not escaped my notice
going to visit friends who knew me under the name of guillaume berlat and amongst whom my resemblance to ars√®ne lupin was a subject of many innocent jests i could not assume a disguise and my presence had been remarked
so beyond question the commissary of police at rouen notified by telegraph and assisted by numerous agents would be awaiting the train would question all suspicious passengers and proceed to search the cars
of course i had foreseen all that but it had not disturbed me as i was certain that the police of rouen would not be any shrewder than the police of paris and that i could escape recognition would it not be sufficient for me to carelessly display my card as d√©put√© thanks to which i had inspired complete confidence in the at but the situation was greatly changed
it was impossible to attempt one of my usual tricks
in one of the compartments the commissary of police would find mon
ars√®ne lupin bound hand and foot as docile as a lamb packed up all ready to be dumped into a
he would have simply to accept delivery of the parcel the same as if it were so much merchandise or a basket of fruit and vegetables
yet to avoid that shameful d√©nouement what could i do bound and gagged as i was
and the train was rushing on toward rouen the next and only station
another problem was presented in which i was less interested but the solution of which aroused my professional curiosity
what were the intentions of my rascally companion
of course if i had been alone he could on our arrival at rouen leave the car slowly and fearlessly
as soon as the door of the compartment should be opened the lady now so quiet and humble would scream and call for help
that was the dilemma that perplexed me
why had he not reduced her to a helpless condition similar to mine
that would have given him ample time to disappear before his double crime was discovered
he was still smoking with his eyes fixed upon the window that was now being streaked with drops of rain
once he turned picked up my and consulted it
the lady had to feign a continued lack of consciousness in order to deceive the enemy
but fits of coughing provoked by the smoke exposed her true condition
as to me i was very uncomfortable and very tired
the train was rushing on joyously intoxicated with its own speed
saint etienne at that moment the man arose and took two steps toward us which caused the lady to utter a cry of alarm and fall into a genuine swoon
he lowered the window on our side
a heavy rain was now falling and by a gesture the man expressed his annoyance at his not having an umbrella or an overcoat
he also took my overcoat and put it on
he turned up the bottoms of his trousers then leaned over and raised the exterior latch of the door
was he going to throw himself upon the track
at that speed it would have been instant death
the man opened the door and stood on the upper step
the darkness the smoke the noise all gave a fantastic appearance to his actions
but suddenly the train diminished its speed
a moment later it increased its speed then slowed up again
probably some repairs were being made in that part of the tunnel which obliged the trains to diminish their speed and the man was aware of the fact
he immediately stepped down to the lower step closed the door behind him and leaped to the ground
the lady immediately recovered her wits and her first act was to lament the loss of her jewels
she understood and quickly removed the gag that stifled me
she wished to untie the cords that bound me but i prevented her
no no the police must see everything exactly as it stands
i want them to see what the rascal did to us
you should have done that when he made the attack on me
i tell you that he was on this train
i recognized him from his portrait
and now he has gone off with my jewels
when we arrive at rouen be at the door and call
the police and the railway employees will come
tell what you have seen the assault made on me and the flight of ars√®ne lupin
give a description of him soft hat umbrella yours gray overcoat yours said she
it seems to me he didn t have one when he came in
yes yes unless the coat was one that some one had forgotten and left in the rack
at all events he had it when he went away and that is the essential point
you must tell your name first thing you do
your husband s official position will stimulate the zeal of the police
i gave her some further instructions in a rather imperious tone tell them my name guillaume berlat
if necessary say that you know me
we must expedite the preliminary investigation
the important thing is the pursuit of ars√®ne lupin
guillaume berlat a friend of your husband
she was already calling and gesticulating
as soon as the train stopped several men entered the compartment
panting for breath the lady exclaimed ars√®ne lupin
my husband is a director of the penitentiary service
here is my brother georges ardelle director of the cr√©dit rouennais
she embraced a young man who had just joined us and whom the commissary saluted
then she continued weeping yes ars√®ne lupin while monsieur was sleeping he seized him by the throat
the commissary asked but where is ars√®ne lupin he leaped from the train when passing through the tunnel
besides he was seen at the station
he wore a soft hat no a hard felt like that said the commissary pointing to my hat
he had a soft hat i am sure repeated madame renaud and a gray overcoat
yes that is right replied the commissary the telegram says he wore a gray overcoat with a black velvet collar
exactly a black velvet collar exclaimed madame renaud triumphantly
the excellent friend i had in that little woman
the police agents had now released me
i bit my lips until they ran blood
stooping over with my handkerchief over my mouth an attitude quite natural in a person who has remained for a long time in an uncomfortable position and whose mouth shows the bloody marks of the gag i addressed the commissary in a weak voice monsieur it was ars√®ne lupin
if we make haste he can be caught yet
i think i may be of some service to you
the railway car in which the crime occurred was detached from the train to serve as a mute witness at the official investigation
the train continued on its way to havre
we were then conducted to the s office through a crowd of curious spectators
then i had a sudden access of doubt and discretion
under some pretext or other i must gain my automobile and escape
something might happen for instance a telegram from paris and i would be lost
abandoned to my own resources in an unfamiliar country i could not hope to catch him
i must make the attempt i said to myself
it may be a difficult game but an amusing one and the stake is well worth the trouble
and when the commissary asked us to repeat the story of the robbery i exclaimed monsieur really ars√®ne lupin is getting the start of us
my automobile is waiting in the courtyard
if you will be so kind as to use it we can try
the commissary smiled and replied the idea is a good one so good indeed that it is already being carried out
two of my men have set out on bicycles
they have been gone for some time
there they will gather evidence secure witnesses and follow on the track of ars√®ne lupin
i could not refrain from shrugging my shoulders as i replied your men will not secure any evidence or any witnesses
ars√®ne lupin will not allow anyone to see him emerge from the tunnel
he will take the first road to rouen where we will arrest him
then he will remain in the vicinity where his capture will be even more certain
he will not remain in the vicinity
i looked at my watch and said at the present moment ars√®ne lupin is prowling around the station at darn√©tal
at ten fifty that is in minutes from now he will take the train that goes from rouen to amiens
while we were in the car ars√®ne lupin consulted my railway guide
was there not far from the spot where he disappeared another line of railway a station upon that line and a train stopping at that station
on consulting my railway guide i found such to be the case
really monsieur said the commissary that is a marvelous deduction
i congratulate you on your skill
i was now convinced that i had made a mistake in displaying so much cleverness
the commissary regarded me with astonishment and i thought a slight suspicion entered his official mind
scarcely that for the photographs distributed broadcast by the police department were too imperfect they presented an ars√®ne lupin so different from the one he had before him that he could not possibly recognize me by it
but all the same he was troubled confused and
nothing stimulates the comprehension so much as the loss of a pocketbook and the desire to recover it
and it seems to me that if you will give me two of your men we may be able
i beg of you monsieur le commissaire cried madame renaud listen to mon
the intervention of my excellent friend was decisive
pronounced by her the wife of an influential official the name of berlat became really my own and gave me an identity that no mere suspicion could affect
the commissary arose and said believe me monsieur berlat i shall be delighted to see you succeed
i am as much interested as you are in the arrest of ars√®ne lupin
he accompanied me to the automobile and introduced two of his men honor√© massol and gaston delivet who were assigned to assist me
my chauffer cranked up the car and i took my place at the wheel
a few seconds later we left the station
i must confess that in rolling over the boulevards that surrounded the old norman city in my swift i experienced a deep feeling of pride and the motor responded sympathetically to my desires
at right and left the trees flew past us with startling rapidity and i free out of danger had simply to arrange my little personal affairs with the two honest representatives of the rouen police who were sitting behind me
ars√®ne lupin was going in search of ars√®ne lupin
modest guardians of social order gaston delivet and honor√© massol how valuable was your assistance
what would i have done without you
without you many times at the i might have taken the wrong route
without you ars√®ne lupin would have made a mistake and the other would have escaped
i had yet to capture the thief and recover the stolen papers
under no circumstances must my two acolytes be permitted to see those papers much less to seize them
that was a point that might give me some difficulty
we arrived at darn√©tal three minutes after the departure of the train
true i had the consolation of learning that a man wearing a gray overcoat with a black velvet collar had taken the train at the station
he had bought a ticket for amiens
certainly my d√©but as detective was a promising one
delivet said to me the train is express and the next stop is in nineteen minutes
if we do not reach there before ars√®ne lupin he can proceed to amiens or change for the train going to cl√®res and from that point reach dieppe or paris
how far to mont√©rolier kilometres
never had my faithful responded to my impatience with such ardor and regularity
it comprehended my animosity against that rascally ars√®ne lupin
the traitor turn to the right cried delivet then to the left
we fairly flew scarcely touching the ground
the looked like little timid beasts that vanished at our approach
suddenly at a turn of the road we saw a vortex of smoke
for a kilometre it was a struggle side by side but an unequal struggle in which the issue was certain
we won the race by twenty lengths
in three seconds we were on the platform standing before the carriages
the doors were opened and some passengers alighted but not my thief
we made a search through the compartments
i cried he must have recognized me in the automobile as we were racing side by side and he leaped from the train
i started in pursuit of the man followed by my two acolytes or rather followed by one of them for the other massol proved himself to be a runner of exceptional speed and endurance
in a few moments he had made an appreciable gain upon the fugitive
the man noticed it leaped over a hedge scampered across a meadow and entered a thick grove
when we reached this grove massol was waiting for us
he went no farther for fear of losing us
quite right my dear friend i said
after such a run our victim must be out of wind
i examined the surroundings with the idea of proceeding alone in the arrest of the fugitive in order to recover my papers concerning which the authorities would doubtless ask many disagreeable questions
then i returned to my companions and said it is all quite easy
you massol take your place at the left you delivet at the right
from there you can observe the entire posterior line of the bush and he can not escape without you seeing him except by that ravine and i shall watch it
if he does not come out voluntarily i will enter and drive him out toward one or the other of you
i forgot in case i need you a pistol shot
massol and delivet walked away to their respective posts
as soon as they had disappeared i entered the grove with the greatest precaution so as to be neither seen nor heard
i encountered dense thickets through which narrow paths had been cut but the overhanging boughs compelled me to adopt a stooping posture
one of these paths led to a clearing in which i found footsteps upon the wet grass
i followed them they led me to the foot of a mound which was surmounted by a deserted dilapidated hovel
he must be there i said to myself
i crept cautiously to the side of the building
a slight noise informed me that he was there and then through an opening i saw him
he tried to fire a revolver that he held in his hand
i threw him to the ground in such a manner that his arms were beneath him twisted and helpless whilst i held him down with my knee on his breast
listen my boy i whispered in his ear
you are to deliver over to me immediately and gracefully my pocketbook and the lady s jewels and in return therefore i will save you from the police and enroll you amongst my friends
one word yes or no yes he murmured
your escape this morning was well planned
he fumbled in his pocket drew out a large knife and tried to strike me with it
with one hand i parried the attack with the other i gave him a sharp blow on the carotid artery
in my pocketbook i recovered my papers and
upon an envelope addressed to him i read his name pierre onfrey
pierre onfrey the assassin of the rue lafontaine at auteuil
pierre onfrey he who had cut the throats of madame delbois and her two daughters
yes those were the features which in the compartment had evoked in me the memory of a face i could not then recall
i placed in an envelope two of one hundred francs each with a card bearing these words ars√®ne lupin to his worthy colleagues honor√© massol and gaston delivet as a slight token of his gratitude
i placed it in a prominent spot in the room where they would be sure to find it
beside it i placed madame renaud s handbag
why could i not return it to the lady who had befriended me
i must confess that i had taken from it everything that possessed any interest or value leaving there only a shell comb a stick of rouge dorin for the lips and an empty purse
but you know business is business
and then really her husband is engaged in such a dishonorable vocation
i was unable to save him or condemn him
so i took his revolver and fired a shot in the air
my two acolytes will come and attend to his case i said to myself as i hastened away by the road through the ravine
twenty minutes later i was seated in my automobile
at four o clock i telegraphed to my friends at rouen that an unexpected event would prevent me from making my promised visit
between ourselves considering what my friends must now know my visit is postponed indefinitely
the evening newspapers informed me that pierre onfrey had been captured at last
next day let us not despise the advantages of judicious advertising the
echo de published this sensational item yesterday near buchy after numerous exciting incidents ars√®ne lupin effected the arrest of pierre onfrey
the assassin of the rue lafontaine had robbed madame renaud wife of the director in the penitentiary service in a railway carriage on the line
ars√®ne lupin restored to madame renaud the that contained her jewels and gave a generous recompense to the two detectives who had assisted him in making that dramatic arrest
the queen s necklace two or three times each year on occasions of unusual importance such as the balls at the austrian embassy or the soir√©es of lady billingstone the countess de wore upon her white shoulders the queen s necklace
it was indeed the famous necklace the legendary necklace that bohmer and bassenge court jewelers had made for madame du barry the veritable necklace that the cardinal de intended to give to queen of france and the same that the adventuress jeanne de valois countess de la motte had pulled to pieces one evening in february  with the aid of her husband and their accomplice r√©taux de villette
to tell the truth the mounting alone was genuine
r√©taux de villette had kept it whilst the count de la motte and his wife scattered to the four winds of heaven the beautiful stones so carefully chosen by bohmer
later he sold the mounting to gaston de nephew and heir of the cardinal who the few diamonds that remained in the possession of the english jeweler jeffreys supplemented them with other stones of the same size but of much inferior quality and thus restored the marvelous necklace to the form in which it had come from the hands of bohmer and bassenge
for nearly a century the house of had prided itself upon the possession of this historic jewel
although adverse circumstances had greatly reduced their fortune they preferred to curtail their household expenses rather than part with this relic of royalty
more particularly the present count clung to it as a man clings to the home of his ancestors
as a matter of prudence he had rented a box at the cr√©dit lyonnais in which to keep it
he went for it himself on the afternoon of the day on which his wife wished to wear it and he himself carried it back next morning
on this particular evening at the reception given at the palais de castille the countess achieved a remarkable success and king christian in whose honor the f√™te was given commented on her grace and beauty
the thousand facets of the diamond sparkled and shone like flames of fire about her shapely neck and shoulders and it is safe to say that none
but she could have borne the weight of such an ornament with so much ease and grace
this was a double triumph and the count de dreux was highly elated when they returned to their chamber in the old house of the faubourg
he was proud of his wife and quite as proud perhaps of the necklace that had conferred added luster to his noble house for generations
his wife also regarded the necklace with an almost childish vanity and it was not without regret that she removed it from her shoulders and handed it to her husband who admired it as passionately as if he had never seen it before
then having placed it in its case of red leather stamped with the cardinal s arms he passed into an adjoining room which was simply an alcove or cabinet that had been cut off from their chamber and which could be entered only by means of a door at the foot of their bed
as he had done on previous occasions he hid it on a high shelf amongst and piles of linen
next morning he arose about nine o clock intending to go to the cr√©dit lyonnais before breakfast
he dressed drank a cup of coffee and went to the stables to give his orders
the condition of one of the horses worried him
he caused it to be exercised in his presence
then he returned to his wife who had not yet left the chamber
when her husband entered she asked are you going out
he entered the cabinet but after a few seconds and without any sign of astonishment he asked did you take it my dear what
i have not even opened that door
he appeared at the door disconcerted and stammered in a scarcely intelligible voice you haven t
she hastened to his assistance and together they made a thorough search throwing the boxes to the floor and overturning the piles of linen
then the count said quite discouraged it is useless to look any more
no no it was on this shelf nowhere else
they lighted a candle as the room was quite dark and then carried out all the linen and other articles that the room contained
and when the room was emptied they confessed in despair that the famous necklace had disappeared
without losing time in vain lamentations the countess notified the commissary of police mon
valorbe who came at once and after hearing their story inquired of the count are you sure that no one passed through your chamber during the night
absolutely sure as i am a very light sleeper
besides the chamber door was bolted and i remember unbolting it this morning when my wife rang for her maid
and there is no other entrance to the cabinet
no windows yes but it is closed up
valorbe observed at once that the lower half of the window was covered by a large press which was however so narrow that it did not touch the casement on either side
on what does this window open a small inner court
and you have a floor above this
two but on a level with the servant s floor there is a close grating over the court
that is why this room is so dark
when the press was moved they found that the window was fastened which would not have been the case if anyone had entered that way
unless said the count they went out through our chamber
in that case you would have found the door unbolted
the commissary considered the situation for a moment then asked the countess did any of your servants know that you wore the necklace last evening
certainly i didn t conceal the fact
but nobody knew that it was hidden in that cabinet
no one no one unless be quite sure madam as it is a very important point
she turned to her husband and said i was thinking of henriette
she didn t know where we kept it
who is this woman henriette asked mon
a who was disowned by her family for marrying beneath her
after her husband s death i furnished an apartment in this house for her and her son
she is clever with her needle and has done some work for me
same as ours at the end of the corridor
the window of her kitchen opens on this little court does it not
valorbe then asked to see henriette
they went to her apartment she was sewing whilst her son raoul about six years old was sitting beside her reading
the commissary was surprised to see the wretched apartment that had been provided for the woman
it consisted of one room without a fireplace and a very small room that served as a kitchen
the commissary proceeded to question her
she appeared to be overwhelmed on learning of the theft
last evening she had herself dressed the countess and placed the necklace upon her shoulders
she exclaimed it can t be possible
is it possible that the thief may have passed through your room
she laughed heartily never supposing that she could be an object of suspicion
she opened the kitchen window and said see it is at least three metres to the ledge of the opposite window
who told you that we supposed the theft might have been committed in that way
but the necklace was in the cabinet wasn t it
why i have always known that it was kept there at night
it had been mentioned in my presence
her face though still young bore unmistakable traces of sorrow and resignation
and it now assumed an expression of anxiety as if some danger threatened her
the child took her hand and kissed it affectionately
when they were alone again the count said to the commissary i do not suppose you suspect henriette
i quite agree with you replied mon
at most i thought there might have been an unconscious complicity
but i confess that even that theory must be abandoned as it does not help solve the problem now before us
the commissary of police abandoned the investigation which was now taken up and completed by the examining judge
he questioned the servants examined the condition of the bolt experimented with the opening and closing of the cabinet window and explored the little court from top to bottom
the window could not be opened or closed from the outside
the inquiries especially concerned henriette for in spite of everything they always turned in her direction
they made a thorough investigation of her past life and ascertained that during the last three years she had left the house only four times and her business on those occasions was satisfactorily explained
as a matter of fact she acted as chambermaid and seamstress to the countess who treated her with great strictness and even severity
at the end of a week the examining judge had secured no more definite information than the commissary of police
the judge said admitting that we know the guilty party which we do not we are confronted by the fact that we do not know how the theft was committed
we are brought face to face with two obstacles a door and a window both closed and fastened
how could anyone enter and moreover how could any one escape leaving behind him a bolted door and a fastened window
at the end of four months the secret opinion of the judge was that the count and countess being hard pressed for money which was their normal condition had sold the queen s necklace
the loss of the famous jewel was a severe blow to the
their credit being no longer propped up by the reserve fund that such a treasure constituted they found themselves confronted by more exacting creditors and
they were obliged to cut down to the quick to sell or mortgage every article that possessed any commercial value
in brief it would have been their ruin if two large legacies from some distant relatives had not saved them
their pride also suffered a downfall as if they had lost a quartering from their escutcheon
and strange to relate it was upon her former schoolmate henriette that the countess vented her spleen
toward her the countess displayed the most spiteful feelings and even openly accused her
first henriette was relegated to the servants quarters and next day discharged
for some time the count and countess passed an uneventful life
only one incident of record occurred during that period
some months after the departure of henriette the countess was surprised when she received and read the following letter signed by henriette madame i do not know how to thank you for it was you was it not who sent me that
it could not have been anyone else
if i am wrong excuse me and accept my sincere thanks for your past favors
the present or past favors of the countess consisted principally of injustice and neglect
when asked for an explanation henriette replied that she had received a letter through the mails enclosing two of one thousand francs each
the envelope which she enclosed with her reply bore the paris and was addressed in a handwriting that was obviously disguised
now whence came those two thousand francs
henriette received a similar letter and a like sum of money twelve months later
and a third time and a fourth and each year for a period of six years with this difference that in the fifth and sixth years the sum was doubled
there was another difference the authorities having seized one of the letters under the pretext that it was not registered the last two letters were duly sent according to the postal regulations the first dated from the other from suresnes
the writer signed the first one anquety and the other p√©chard
the addresses that he gave were false
at the end of six years henriette died and the mystery remained unsolved
all these events are known to the public
the case was one of those which excite public interest and it was a strange coincidence that this necklace which had caused such a great commotion in france at the close of the eighteenth century should create a similar commotion a century later
but what i am about to relate is known only to the parties directly interested and a few others from whom the count exacted a promise of secrecy
as it is probable that some day or other that promise will be broken i have no hesitation in rending the veil and thus disclosing the key to the mystery the explanation of the letter published in the morning papers two days ago an extraordinary letter which increased if possible the mists and shadows that envelope this inscrutable drama
five days ago a number of guests were dining with the count de
there were several ladies present including his two nieces and his cousin and the following gentlemen the president of essaville the deputy bochas the chevalier floriani whom the count had known in sicily and general marquis de rouzi√®res an old club friend
after the repast coffee was served by the ladies who gave the gentlemen permission to smoke their cigarettes provided they would not desert the salon
the conversation was general and finally one of the guests chanced to speak of celebrated crimes
and that gave the marquis de rouzi√®res who delighted to tease the count an opportunity to mention the affair of the queen s necklace a subject that the count detested
each one expressed his own opinion of the affair and of course their various theories were not only contradictory but impossible
and you monsieur said the countess to the chevalier floriani what is your opinion
all the guests protested for the chevalier had just related in an entertaining manner various adventures in which he had participated with his father a magistrate at palermo and which established his judgment and taste in such manners
i confess said he i have sometimes succeeded in unraveling mysteries that the cleverest detectives have renounced yet i do not claim to be sherlock holmes
moreover i know very little about the affair of the queen s necklace
everybody now turned to the count who was thus obliged quite unwillingly to narrate all the circumstances connected with the theft
the chevalier listened reflected asked a few questions and said it is very strange
at first sight the problem appears to be a very simple one
the count shrugged his shoulders
the others drew closer to the chevalier who continued in a dogmatic tone as a general rule in order to find the author of a crime or a theft it is necessary to determine how that crime or theft was committed or at least how it could have been committed
in the present case nothing is more simple because we are face to face not with several theories but with one positive fact that is to say the thief could only enter by the chamber door or the window of the cabinet
now a person can not open a bolted door from the outside
therefore he must have entered through the window
but it was closed and fastened and we found it fastened afterward declared the count
in order to do that continued floriani without heeding the interruption he had simply to construct a bridge a plank or a ladder between the balcony of the kitchen and the ledge of the window and as the
but i repeat that the window was fastened exclaimed the count impatiently
this time floriani was obliged to reply
he did so with the greatest tranquility as if the objection was the most insignificant affair in the world
i will admit that it was but is there not a transom in the upper part of the window
in the first place that was customary in houses of that date and in the second place without such a transom the theft can not be explained
yes there is one but it was closed the same as the window
consequently we did not pay attention to it
that was a mistake for if you had examined it you would have found that it had been opened
but how i presume that like all others it opens by means of a wire with a ring on the lower end
yes but i do not see now through a hole in the window a person could by the aid of some instrument let us say a poker with a hook at the end grip the ring pull down and open the transom
the count laughed and said excellent excellent
your scheme is very cleverly constructed but you overlook one thing monsieur there is no hole in the window
in order to see it you must look for it and no one has looked
the hole is there it must be there at the side of the window in the putty
in a vertical direction of course
he paced up and down the room two or three times in a nervous manner then approaching floriani said nobody has been in that room since nothing has been changed
very well monsieur you can easily satisfy yourself that my explanation is correct
it does not agree with the facts established by the examining judge
you have seen nothing and yet you contradict all that we have seen and all that we know
floriani paid no attention to the count s petulance
he simply smiled and said mon dieu monsieur i submit my theory that is all
if i am mistaken you can easily prove it
i confess that your assurance the count muttered a few more words then suddenly rushed to the door and passed out
not a word was uttered in his absence and this profound silence gave the situation an air of almost tragic importance
he said to his friends in a trembling voice i beg your pardon
the revelations of the chevalier were so unexpected
his wife questioned him eagerly speak what is it
he stammered the hole is there at the very spot at the side of the window
he seized the chevalier s arm and said to him in an imperious tone now monsieur proceed
i admit that you are right so far but now that is not all go on tell us the rest of it
floriani disengaged his arm gently and after a moment continued well in my opinion this is what happened
the thief knowing that the countess was going to wear the necklace that evening had prepared his gangway or bridge during your absence
he watched you through the window and saw you hide the necklace
afterward he cut the glass and pulled the ring
but the distance was so great that it would be impossible for him to reach the through the transom
well then if he could not open the window by reaching through the transom he must have crawled through the transom
then it was not a man declared floriani
if the transom is too small to admit a man it must have been a child
did you not say that your friend henriette had a son
then in all probability it was raoul who committed the theft
for instance he stopped and reflected for a moment then continued
for instance that gangway or bridge
it is improbable that the child could have brought it in from outside the house and carried it away again without being observed
he must have used something close at hand
in the little room used by henriette as a kitchen were there not some shelves against the wall on which she placed her pans and dishes
two shelves to the best of my memory
are you sure that those shelves are really fastened to the wooden brackets that support them
for if they are not we could be justified in presuming that the child removed them fastened them together and thus formed his bridge
perhaps also since there was a stove we might find the bent poker that he used to open the transom
without saying a word the count left the room and this time those present did not feel the nervous anxiety they had experienced the first time
they were confident that floriani was right and no one was surprised when the count returned and declared
you have seen the shelves and the poker
the shelves have been unnailed and the poker is there yet
but the countess exclaimed you had better say it was his mother
she must have compelled her son no declared the chevalier the mother had nothing to do with it
the child could not have done it without the mother s knowledge
true they lived in the same room but all this happened in the adjoining room during the night while the mother was asleep
and the necklace said the count
it would have been found amongst the child s things
that morning on which you found him reading he had just come from school and perhaps the commissary of police instead of wasting his time on the innocent mother would have been better employed in searching the child s desk amongst his
but how do you explain those two thousand francs that henriette received each year
are they not evidence of her complicity
if she had been an accomplice would she have thanked you for that money
and then was she not closely watched
but the child being free could easily go to a neighboring city negotiate with some dealer and sell him one diamond or two diamonds as he might wish upon condition that the money should be sent from paris and that proceeding could be repeated from year to year
an indescribable anxiety oppressed the and their guests
there was something in the tone and attitude of floriani something more than the chevalier s assurance which from the beginning had so annoyed the count
there was a touch of irony that seemed rather hostile than sympathetic
but the count affected to laugh as he said
all that is very ingenious and interesting and i congratulate you upon your vivid imagination
no not at all replied floriani with the utmost gravity i imagine nothing
i simply describe the events as they must have occurred
but what do you know about them
i picture to myself the life of the mother and child down there in the country the illness of the mother the schemes of and inventions of the child to sell the precious stones in order to save his mother s life or at least soothe her dying moments
the child becomes a man and then and now i will give my imagination a free rein let us suppose that the man feels a desire to return to the home of his childhood that he does so and that he meets there certain people who suspect and accuse his mother
do you realize the sorrow and anguish of such an interview in the very house wherein the original drama was played
his words seemed to echo for a few seconds in the ensuing silence and one could read upon the faces of the count and countess de dreux a bewildered effort to comprehend his meaning and at the same time the fear and anguish of such a comprehension
the count spoke at last and said who are you monsieur i
the chevalier floriani whom you met at palermo and whom you have been gracious enough to invite to your house on several occasions
it is simply a pastime so far as i am concerned
i endeavor to depict the pleasure that henriette s son if he still lives would have in telling you that he was the guilty party and that he did it because his mother was unhappy as she was on the point of losing the place of a servant by which she lived and because the child suffered at sight of his mother s sorrow
he spoke with suppressed emotion rose partially and inclined toward the countess
there could be no doubt that the chevalier floriani was henriette s son
his attitude and words proclaimed it
besides was it not his obvious intention and desire to be recognized as such
what action would he take against the audacious guest
unmask the man who had once robbed him
and who would believe that absurd story about the guilty child
no better far to accept the situation and pretend not to comprehend the true meaning of it
so the count turning to floriani exclaimed your story is very curious very entertaining i enjoyed it much
but what do you think has become of this young man this model son
i hope he has not abandoned the career in which he made such a brilliant d√©but
to steal the queen s necklace at six years of age the celebrated necklace that was coveted by
and to steal it remarked floriani falling in with the count s mood without costing him the slightest trouble without anyone thinking to examine the condition of the window or to observe that the was too clean that which he had wiped in order to efface the marks he had made in the thick dust
we must admit that it was sufficient to turn the head of a boy at that age
he had simply to desire the thing and reach out his hand to get it
both hands replied the chevalier laughing
his companions received a shock
what mystery surrounded the life of the floriani
how wonderful must have been the life of that adventurer a thief at six years of age and who in search of excitement or at most to gratify a feeling of resentment had come to brave his victim in her own house audaciously foolishly and yet with all the grace and delicacy of a courteous guest
he arose and approached the countess to bid her adieu
did i pursue my role of a step too far
she controlled herself and replied with her accustomed ease not at all monsieur
the legend of that dutiful son interested me very much and i am pleased to know that my necklace had such a brilliant destiny
but do you not think that the son of that woman that henriette was the victim of hereditary influence in the choice of his vocation
he shuddered feeling the point and replied i am sure of it and moreover his natural tendency to crime must have been very strong or he would have been discouraged
why so because as you must know the majority of the diamonds were false
the only genuine stones were the few purchased from the english jeweler the others having been sold one by one to meet the cruel necessities of life
it was still the queen s necklace monsieur replied the countess haughtily and that is something that he henriette s son could not appreciate
he was able to appreciate madame that whether true or false the necklace was nothing more that an object of parade an emblem of senseless pride
the count made a threatening gesture but his wife stopped him
monsieur she said if the man to whom you allude has the slightest sense of honor she stopped intimidated by floriani s cool manner
if that man has the slightest sense of honor he repeated
she felt that she would not gain anything by speaking to him in that manner and in spite of her anger and indignation trembling as she was from humiliated pride she said to him almost politely monsieur the legend says that r√©taux de villette when in possession of the queen s necklace did not disfigure the mounting
he understood that the diamonds were simply the ornament the accessory and that the mounting was the essential work the creation of the artist and he respected it accordingly
do you think that this man had the same feeling
i have no doubt that the mounting still exists
well monsieur if you should happen to meet him will you tell him that he unjustly keeps possession of a relic that is the property and pride of a certain family and that although the stones have been removed the queen s necklace still belongs to the house of
it belongs to us as much as our name or our honor
the chevalier replied simply i shall tell him madame
he bowed to her saluted the count and the other guests and departed
four days later the countess de dreux found upon the table in her chamber a red leather case bearing the cardinal s arms
she opened it and found the queen s necklace
but as all things must in the life of a man who strives for unity and logic converge toward the same goal and as a little advertising never does any harm on the following day the de published these sensational lines the queen s necklace the famous historical jewelry stolen from the family of has been recovered by ars√®ne lupin who hastened to restore it to its rightful owner
we can not too highly commend such a delicate and chivalrous vi
the seven of hearts i am frequently asked this question how did you make the acquaintance of ars√®ne lupin
my connection with ars√®ne lupin was well known
the details that i gather concerning that mysterious man the irrefutable facts that i present the new evidence that i produce the interpretation that i place on certain acts of which the public has seen only the exterior manifestations without being able to discover the secret reasons or the invisible mechanism all establish if not an intimacy at least amicable relations and regular confidences
but how did i make his acquaintance
why was i selected to be his historiographer
the answer is simple chance alone presided over my choice my merit was not considered
it was chance that put me in his way
it was by chance that i was participant in one of his strangest and most mysterious adventures and by chance that i was an actor in a drama of which he was the marvelous stage director an obscure and intricate drama bristling with such thrilling events that i feel a certain embarrassment in undertaking to describe it
the first act takes place during that memorable night of  june of which so much has already been said
and for my part i attribute the anomalous conduct of which i was guilty on that occasion to the unusual frame of mind in which i found myself on my return home
i had dined with some friends at the cascade restaurant and the entire evening whilst we smoked and the orchestra played melancholy waltzes we talked only of crimes and thefts and dark and frightful intrigues
that is always a poor overture to a night s sleep
jean daspry that delightful heedless daspry who six months later was killed in such a tragic manner on the frontier of morocco jean daspry and i returned on foot through the dark warm night
when we arrived in front of the little house in which i had lived for a year at neuilly on the boulevard maillot he said to me are you afraid what an idea
really i am not a coward and yet
well you are very cheering i must say
i say that as i would say anything else
the have impressed me with their stories of brigands and thieves
i took out my key and opened the door
well that is good i murmured antoine has forgotten to light a candle
then i recalled the fact that antoine was away i had given him a short leave of absence
forthwith i was disagreeably oppressed by the darkness and silence of the night
i ascended the stairs on tiptoe and reached my room as quickly as possible then contrary to my usual habit i turned the key and pushed the bolt
the light of my candle restored my courage
yet i was careful to take my revolver from its case a large powerful weapon and place it beside my bed
that precaution completed my reassurance
i laid down and as usual took a book from my to read myself to sleep
then i received a great surprise
instead of the with which i had marked my place on the preceding i found an envelope closed with five seals of red wax
it was addressed to me and marked urgent
who could have put it in that place
nervously i tore open the envelope and read from the moment you open this letter whatever happens whatever you may hear do not move do not utter one cry
i am not a coward and quite as well as another i can face real danger or smile at the visionary perils of imagination
but let me repeat i was in an anomalous condition of mind with my nerves set on edge by the events of the evening
besides was there not in my present situation something startling and mysterious calculated to disturb the most courageous spirit
my feverish fingers clutched the sheet of paper and i read and those threatening words do not move do not utter one cry
it is a joke the work of some cheerful idiot
i was about to laugh a good loud laugh
what haunting fear compressed my throat
at least i would blow out the candle
do not move or you are doomed were the words he had written
these are frequently more imperious than the most positive realities but why should i struggle against them
at that moment i heard a slight noise followed by crackling sounds proceeding from a large room used by me as a library
a small room or antechamber was situated between the library and my bedchamber
the approach of an actual danger greatly excited me and i felt a desire to get up seize my revolver and rush into the library
i did not rise i saw one of the curtains of the left window move
there was no doubt about it the curtain had moved
i saw quite distinctly in the narrow space between the curtains and the window a human form a bulky mass that prevented the curtains from hanging straight
and it is equally certain that the man saw me through the large meshes of the curtain
then i understood the situation
his mission was to guard me while the others carried away their booty
should i rise and seize my revolver
at the least movement at the least cry i was doomed
then came a terrific noise that shook the house this was followed by lighter sounds two or three together like those of a hammer that rebounded
at least that was the impression formed in my confused brain
these were mingled with other sounds thus creating a veritable uproar which proved that the intruders were not only bold but felt themselves secure from interruption
no rather weakness a total inability to move any portion of my body combined with discretion for why should i struggle
behind that man there were ten others who would come to his assistance
should i risk my life to save a few tapestries and bibelots
throughout the night my torture endured
insufferable torture terrible anguish
the noises had stopped but i was in constant fear of their renewal
the man who was guarding me weapon in hand
my fearful eyes remained cast in his direction
and a profuse perspiration oozed from every pore of my body
suddenly i experienced an immense relief a whose sound was familiar to me passed along the boulevard and at the same time i had an impression that the light of a new day was trying to steal through the closed
at last daylight penetrated the room other vehicles passed along the boulevard and all the phantoms of the night vanished
then i put one arm out of the bed slowly and cautiously
my eyes were fixed upon the curtain locating the exact spot at which i must fire i made an exact calculation of the movements i must make then quickly i seized my revolver and fired
i leaped from my bed with a cry of deliverance and rushed to the window
the bullet had passed through the curtain and the but it had not touched the man for the very good reason that there was none there
thus during the entire night i had been hypnotized by a fold of the curtain
and during that time the malefactors
furiously with an enthusiasm that nothing could have stopped i turned the key opened the door crossed the antechamber opened another door and rushed into the library
but amazement stopped me on the threshold panting astounded more astonished than i had been by the absence of the man
all the things that i supposed had been stolen furniture books pictures old tapestries everything was in its proper place
notwithstanding that uproar those noises of removal
i made a tour i inspected the walls i made a mental inventory of all the familiar objects
and what was more disconcerting there was no clue to the intruders not a sign not a chair disturbed not the trace of a footstep
i said to myself pressing my hands on my bewildered head surely i am not crazy
inch by inch i made a careful examination of the room
unless i could consider this as a discovery under a small persian rug i found a card an ordinary playing card
it was the seven of hearts it was like any other seven of hearts in french with this slight but curious exception the extreme point of each of the seven red spots or hearts was pierced by a hole round and regular as if made with the point of an awl
a card and a letter found in a book
but was not that sufficient to affirm that i had not been the plaything of a dream
throughout the day i continued my searches in the library
it was a large room much too large for the requirements of such a house and the decoration of which attested the bizarre taste of its founder
the floor was a mosaic of multicolored stones formed into large symmetrical designs
the walls were covered with a similar mosaic arranged in panels pompeiian allegories byzantine compositions frescoes of the middle ages
an emperor wearing a gold crown a flowing beard and holding a sword in his right hand
quite high after the style of an artist s studio there was a large window the only one in the room
that window being always open at night it was probable that the men had entered through it by the aid of a ladder
but again there was no evidence
the bottom of the ladder would have left some marks in the soft earth beneath the window but there were none
nor were there any traces of footsteps in any part of the yard
i had no idea of informing the police because the facts i had before me were so absurd and inconsistent
however as i was then a reporter on the staff of the gil blas i wrote a lengthy account of my adventure and it was published in the paper on the second day thereafter
the article attracted some attention but no one took it seriously
they regarded it as a work of fiction rather than a story of real life
but daspry who took an interest in such matters came to see me made a study of the affair but reached no conclusion
a few mornings later the rang and antoine came to inform me that a gentleman desired to see me
i directed antoine to show him up
he was a man of about forty years of age with a very dark complexion lively features and whose correct dress slightly frayed proclaimed a taste that contrasted strangely with his rather vulgar manners
without any preamble he said to me in a rough voice that confirmed my suspicion as to his social position monsieur whilst in a caf√© i picked up a copy of the gil blas and read your article
are all the facts related by you quite correct
well in that case i can perhaps give you some information
first i must be sure that the facts are exactly as you have related them
i must remain alone in this room
i do not understand i said with surprise
it s an idea that occurred to me when reading your article
certain details established an extraordinary coincidence with another case that came under my notice
if i am mistaken i shall say nothing more
and the only means of ascertaining the truth is by my remaining in the room alone
what was at the bottom of this proposition
later i recalled that the man was exceedingly nervous but at the same time although somewhat astonished i found nothing particularly abnormal about the man or the request he had made
moreover my curiosity was aroused so i replied very well
three minutes from now i will rejoin you
i left the room and went downstairs
why did those moments seem so solemn and weird
two minutes and a half two minutes and three quarters
i bounded up the stairs and entered the room
in the middle of the room the man was lying on his left side motionless
blood was flowing from a wound in his forehead
near his hand was a revolver still smoking
but in addition to this frightful spectacle my attention was attracted by another object
at two feet from the body upon the floor i saw a
the lower extremity of each of the seven spots was pierced with a small round hole
a later the commissary of police arrived then the coroner and the chief of the s√ªret√© mon
i had been careful not to touch the corpse
the preliminary inquiry was very brief and disclosed nothing
there were no papers in the pockets of the deceased no name upon his clothes no initial upon his linen nothing to give any clue to his identity
the room was in the same perfect order as before
the furniture had not been disturbed
yet this man had not come to my house solely for the purpose of killing himself or because he considered my place the most convenient one for his suicide
there must have been a motive for his act of despair and that motive was no doubt the result of some new fact ascertained by him during the three minutes he was alone
what frightful secret had been revealed to him
there was no answer to these questions
but at the last moment an incident occurred that appeared to us of considerable importance
as two policemen were raising the body to place it on a stretcher the left hand thus being disturbed a crumpled card fell from it
the card bore these words georges andermatt  rue de berry
georges andermatt was a rich banker in paris the founder and president of the metal exchange which had given such an impulse to the metallic industries in france
he lived in princely style was the possessor of numerous automobiles coaches and an expensive
his social affairs were very select and madame andermatt was noted for her grace and beauty
i the chief of the s√ªret√© leaned over him
andermatt is a thin man and slightly grey
but why this card have you a telephone monsieur
he looked in the directory and then asked for number
dudouis wished him to come at once to  boulevard maillot
andermatt arrived in his automobile
after the circumstances had been explained to him he was taken in to see the corpse
he displayed considerable emotion and spoke in a low tone and apparently unwillingly etienne varin he said
his brother ah he has a brother
he came to see me once on some matter of business
the two brothers live together rue de provence i think
do you know any reason why he should commit suicide
it was your card with your address
it must have been there by some chance that will be disclosed by the investigation
a very strange chance i thought and i felt that the others entertained the same impression
i discovered the same impression in the papers next day and amongst all my friends with whom i discussed the affair
amid the mysteries that enveloped it after the double discovery of the seven of hearts pierced with seven holes after the two inscrutable events that had happened in my house that visiting card promised to throw some light on the affair
through it the truth may be revealed
but contrary to our expectations mon
andermatt furnished no explanation
he said i have told you all i know
i am greatly surprised that my card should be found in such a place and i sincerely hope the point will be cleared up
the official investigation established that the varin brothers were of swiss origin had led a shifting life under various names frequenting gambling resorts associating with a band of foreigners who had been dispersed by the police after a series of robberies in which their participation was established only by their flight
at number  rue de provence where the varin brothers had lived six years before no one knew what had become of them
i confess that for my part the case seemed to me so complicated and so mysterious that i did not think the problem would ever be solved so i concluded to waste no more time upon it
but jean daspry whom i frequently met at that period became more and more interested in it each day
it was he who pointed out to me that item from a foreign newspaper which was reproduced and commented upon by the entire press
it was as follows the first trial of a new model of submarine boat which is expected to revolutionize naval warfare will be given in presence of the former emperor at a place that will be kept secret until the last minute
an indiscretion has revealed its name it is called the
could a connection be established between the name of the and the incidents which we have related
but a connection of what nature
what had happened here could have no possible relation with the
what do you know about it said daspry to me
the most diverse effects often proceed from the same cause
two days later the following foreign news item was received and published
it is said that the plans of the new were prepared by french engineers who having sought in vain the support of their compatriots subsequently entered into negotiations with the british admiralty without success
i do not wish to give undue publicity to certain delicate matters which once provoked considerable excitement
yet since all danger of injury therefrom has now come to an end i must speak of the article that appeared in the
echo de which aroused so much comment at that time and which threw considerable light upon the mystery of the
this is the article as it was published over the signature of salvator the affair of the
ten years ago a young mining engineer louis lacombe wishing to devote his time and fortune to certain studies resigned his position he then held and rented number  boulevard maillot a small house that had been recently built and decorated for an italian count
through the agency of the varin brothers of lausanne one of whom assisted in the preliminary experiments and the other acted as financial agent the young engineer was introduced to georges andermatt the founder of the metal exchange
after several interviews he succeeded in interesting the banker in a boat on which he was working and it was agreed that as soon as the invention was perfected mon
andermatt would use his influence with the minister of marine to obtain a series of trials under the direction of the government
for two years louis lacombe was a frequent visitor at andermatt s house and he submitted to the banker the various improvements he made upon his original plans until one day being satisfied with the perfection of his work he asked mon
andermatt to communicate with the minister of marine
that day louis lacombe dined at mon
he left there about eleven at night
a perusal of the newspapers of that date will show that the young man s family caused every possible inquiry to be made but without success and it was the general opinion that louis lacombe who was known as an original and visionary youth had quietly left for parts unknown
let us accept that theory improbable though it be and let us consider another question which is a most important one for our country what has become of the plans of the
did louis lacombe carry them away
after making a thorough investigation we are able to assert positively that the plans are in existence and are now in the possession of the two brothers varin
how did they acquire such a possession
that is a question not yet determined nor do we know why they have not tried to sell them at an earlier date
did they fear that their title to them would be called in question
if so they have lost that fear and we can announce definitely that the plans of louis lacombe are now the property of foreign power and we are in a position to publish the correspondence that passed between the varin brothers and the representative of that power
the invented by louis lacombe has been actually constructed by our neighbor
will the invention fulfill the optimistic expectations of those who were concerned in that treacherous act
and a adds our special correspondent informs us that the preliminary trial of the has not been satisfactory
it is quite likely that the plans sold and delivered by the varin brothers did not include the final document carried by louis lacombe to mon
andermatt on the day of his disappearance a document that was indispensable to a thorough understanding of the invention
it contained a summary of the final conclusions of the inventor and estimates and figures not contained in the other papers
without this document the plans are incomplete on the other hand without the plans the document is worthless
now is the time to act and recover what belongs to us
it may be a difficult matter but we rely upon the assistance of mon andermatt
it will be to his interest to explain his conduct which has hitherto been so strange and inscrutable
he will explain not only why he concealed these facts at the time of the suicide of etienne varin but also why he has never revealed the disappearance of the paper a fact well known to him
he will tell why during the last six years he paid spies to watch the movements of the varin brothers
we expect from him not only words but acts
otherwise the threat was plainly expressed
what whip was salvator the anonymous writer of the article holding over the head of mon
an army of reporters attacked the banker and ten interviewers announced the scornful manner in which they were treated
thereupon the de announced its position in these words whether mon
andermatt is willing or not he will be henceforth our collaborator in the work we have undertaken
daspry and i were dining together on the day on which that announcement appeared
that evening with the newspapers spread over my table we discussed the affair and examined it from every point of view with that exasperation that a person feels when walking in the dark and finding himself constantly falling over the same obstacles
suddenly without any warning whatsoever the door opened and a lady entered
her face was hidden behind a thick veil
i rose at once and approached her
is it you monsieur who lives here
yes madame but i do not understand the gate was not locked she explained
she did not reply and it occurred to me that she had used the servants entrance
then there was a silence that was quite embarrassing
she looked at daspry and i was obliged to introduce him
i asked her to be seated and explain the object of her visit
she raised her veil and i saw that she was a brunette with regular features and though not handsome she was attractive principally on account of her sad dark eyes
after a brief pause she continued with a voice and manner that were quite easy and natural i have come to see you about that affair you know
i thought i might be able to obtain some information
mon dieu madame i know nothing but what has already appeared in the papers
but if you will point out in what way i can help you
not until then did i suspect that her calm demeanor was assumed and that some poignant grief was concealed beneath that air of tranquility
for a moment we were silent and embarrassed
then daspry stepped forward and said will you permit me to ask you a few questions
whatever those questions may be
when did you see him for the last time
at that time was there anything to lead you to believe that you would never see him again
but he had spoken of a trip to russia in a vague way
then you expected to see him again
he was to dine with us two days later
how do you explain his disappearance
yet the article published in the de indicates yes that the varin brothers had something to do with his disappearance
on what do you base your opinion when he left our house louis lacombe carried a satchel containing all the papers relating to his invention
two days later my husband in a conversation with one of the varin brothers learned that the papers were in their possession
because there was something else in the satchel something besides the papers of louis lacombe
she hesitated was on the point of speaking but finally remained silent
daspry continued i presume that is why your husband has kept a close watch over their movements instead of informing the police
he hoped to recover the papers and at the same time that compromising article which has enabled the two brothers to hold over him threats of exposure and blackmail
ah over you also over me in particular
she uttered the last words in a hollow voice
daspry observed it he paced to and fro for a moment then turning to her asked had you written to louis lacombe
my husband had business with him apart from those business letters had you written to louis lacombe
excuse my insistence but it is absolutely necessary that i should know the truth
and those letters came into the possession of the varin brothers
he has not seen them but alfred varin has told him of their existence and threatened to publish them if my husband should take any steps against him
my husband was afraid of a scandal
but he has tried to recover the letters
you see after that last interview with alfred varin and after some harsh words between me and my husband in which he called me to account we live as strangers
in that case as you have nothing to lose what do you fear
i may be indifferent to him now but i am the woman that he has loved the one he would still love
i am quite sure of that she murmured in a fervent voice he would still love me if he had not got hold of those cursed letters
but the two brothers still defied him
yes and they boasted of having a secure
well i believe my husband discovered that
louis lacombe was very ingenious and amused himself in his leisure hours by making safes and locks
no doubt the varin brothers were aware of that fact and utilized one of lacombe s safes in which to conceal the letters and other things perhaps
but they did not live here i said
before you came four months ago the house had been vacant for some time
and they may have thought that your presence here would not interfere with them when they wanted to get the papers
but they did not count on my husband who came here on the night of  june forced the safe took what he was seeking and left his card to inform the two brothers that he feared them no more and that their positions were now reversed
two days later after reading the article in the gil blas etienne varin came here remained alone in this room found the safe empty and killed himself
after a moment daspry said a very simple theory
andermatt spoken to you since then
has his attitude toward you changed in any way
does he appear more gloomy more anxious
no i haven t noticed any change
and yet you think he has secured the letters
now in my opinion he has not got those letters and it was not he who came here on the night of  june
the mysterious individual who is managing this affair who holds all the threads in his hands and whose invisible but power we have felt from the beginning
it was he and his friends who entered this house on  june it was he who discovered the of the papers it was he who left mon
andermatt s card it is he who now holds the correspondence and the evidence of the treachery of the varin brothers
the man who writes letters to the
have we not convincing evidence of that fact
does he not mention in his letters certain details that no one could know except the man who had thus discovered the secrets of the two brothers
well then stammered madame andermatt in great alarm he has my letters also and it is he who now threatens my husband
tell him all you know and all you may hereafter learn
your interest and his interest are the same
andermatt but against alfred varin
how has your husband the document that completes the plans of louis lacombe
tell that to salvator and if possible procure the document for him
the advice was bold dangerous even at first sight but madame andermatt had no choice
besides as daspry had said she ran no risk
if the unknown writer were an enemy that step would not aggravate the situation
if he were a stranger seeking to accomplish a particular purpose he would attach to those letters only a secondary importance
whatever might happen it was the only solution offered to her and she in her anxiety was only too glad to act on it
she thanked us effusively and promised to keep us informed
in fact two days later she sent us the following letter that she had received from salvator have not found the letters but i will get them
it was in the same handwriting as the note i found in my book on the night of  june
salvator was indeed the originator of that affair
we were beginning to see a little light coming out of the darkness that surrounded us and an unexpected light was thrown on certain points but other points yet remained obscure for instance the finding of the two
perhaps i was unnecessarily concerned about those two cards whose seven punctured spots had appeared to me under such startling circumstances
yet i could not refrain from asking myself what role will they play in the drama
what conclusion must be drawn from the fact that the submarine constructed from the plans of louis lacombe bore the name of
daspry gave little thought to the other two cards he devoted all his attention to another problem which he considered more urgent he was seeking the famous
and who knows said he i may find the letters that salvator did not find by inadvertence perhaps
it is improbable that the varin brothers would have removed from a spot which they deemed inaccessible the weapon which was so valuable to them
in a short time the large room held no more secrets for him so he extended his investigations to the other rooms
he examined the interior and the exterior the stones of the foundation the bricks in the walls he raised the slates of the roof
one day he came with a pickaxe and a spade gave me the spade kept the pickaxe pointed to the adjacent vacant lots and said come
i followed him but i lacked his enthusiasm
he divided the vacant land into several sections which he examined in turn
at last in a corner at the angle formed by the walls of two neighboring proprietors a small pile of earth and gravel covered with briers and grass attracted his attention
for an hour under a hot sun we labored without success
i was discouraged but daspry urged me on
his ardor was as strong as ever
at last daspry s pickaxe unearthed some bones the remains of a skeleton to which some scraps of clothing still hung
i had discovered sticking in the earth a small piece of iron cut in the form of a rectangle on which i thought i could see red spots
that little iron plate was the exact size of a and the red spots made with red lead were arranged upon it in a manner similar to the and each spot was pierced with a round hole similar to the perforations in the two playing cards
listen daspry i have had enough of this
you can stay if it interests you
was that simply the expression of my excited nerves
or was it the result of a laborious task executed under a burning sun
i know that i trembled as i walked away and that i went to bed where i remained hours restless and feverish haunted by skeletons that danced around me and threw their bleeding hearts at my head
he came to my house every day and remained three or four hours which he spent in the large room ferreting thumping tapping
the letters are here in this room he said from time to time they are here
on the morning of the third day i arose feeble yet but cured
a substantial breakfast cheered me up
but a letter that i received that afternoon contributed more than anything else to my complete recovery and aroused in me a lively curiosity
this was the letter monsieur the drama the first act of which transpired on the night of  june is now drawing to a close
force of circumstances compel me to bring the two principal actors in that drama face to face and i wish that meeting to take place in your house if you will be so kind as to give me the use of it for this evening from nine o clock to eleven
it will be advisable to give your servant leave of absence for the evening and perhaps you will be so kind as to leave the field open to the two adversaries
you will remember that when i visited your house on the night of  june i took excellent care of your property
i feel that i would do you an injustice if i should doubt for one moment your absolute discretion in this affair
i was amused at the facetious tone of his letter and also at the whimsical nature of his request
there was a charming display of confidence and candor in his language and nothing in the world could have induced me to deceive him or repay his confidence with ingratitude
i gave my servant a theatre ticket and he left the house at eight o clock
a few minutes later daspry arrived
well i have left the garden gate unlocked so anyone can enter
i will be discreet but i am resolved to see what takes place
exclaimed daspry laughing you are right and i shall stay with you
we were interrupted by the sound of the
here already said daspry twenty minutes ahead of time
i went to the door and ushered in the visitor
she was faint and nervous and in a stammering voice she ejaculated my husband is coming
they intend to give him the letters
a message came for my husband while we were at dinner
the servant gave it to me by mistake
my husband grabbed it quickly but he was too late
it was something like this at nine o clock this evening be at boulevard maillot with the papers connected with the affair
so after dinner i hastened here
what do you think about it asked daspry turning to me
andermatt is one of the invited guests
yes but for what purpose that is what we are going to find out
the three of us could hide comfortably behind the velvet and observe all that should happen in the room
we seated ourselves there with madame andermatt in the centre
a few minutes later the garden gate creaked upon its hinges
i confess that i was greatly agitated
i was about to learn the key to the mystery
the startling events of the last few weeks were about to be explained and under my eyes the last battle was going to be fought
daspry seized the hand of madame andermatt and said to her not a word not a movement
whatever you may see or hear keep quiet
i recognized him at once owing to the close resemblance he bore to his brother etienne
there was the same slouching gait the same cadaverous face covered with a black beard
he entered with the nervous air of a man who is accustomed to fear the presence of traps and ambushes who scents and avoids them
he glanced about the room and i had the impression that the chimney masked with a velvet porti√®re did not please him
he took three steps in our direction when something caused him to turn and walk toward the old mosaic king with the flowing beard and flamboyant sword which he examined minutely mounting on a chair and following with his fingers the outlines of the shoulders and head and feeling certain parts of the face
suddenly he leaped from the chair and walked away from it
he had heard the sound of approaching footsteps
was it you who brought me here i
by no means protested varin in a rough jerky voice that reminded me of his brother on the contrary it was your letter that brought me here
a letter signed by you in which you offered i never wrote to you declared mon
instinctively varin was put on his guard not against the banker but against the unknown enemy who had drawn him into this trap
a second time he looked in our direction then walked toward the door
there is something about this affair i don t like
but i have something to say to you and this is a good time to say it
varin recoiled before the resolute attitude of the banker as he muttered well then be quick about it
one thing astonished me and i have no doubt my two companions experienced a similar feeling
was he not a necessary party at this conference
or was he satisfied to let these two adversaries fight it out between themselves
at all events his absence was a great disappointment although it did not detract from the dramatic strength of the situation
andermatt approached varin and face to face eye to eye said now after all these years and when you have nothing more to fear you can answer me candidly what have you done with louis lacombe
as if i knew anything about him
you and your brother were his constant companions almost lived with him in this very house
you knew all about his plans and his work
and the last night i ever saw louis lacombe when i parted with him at my door i saw two men slinking away in the shadows of the trees
well what has that to do with me
the two men were you and your brother
the best proof is that two days later you yourself showed me the papers and the plans that belonged to lacombe and offered to sell them
how did these papers come into your possession
andermatt that we found them on louis lacombe s table the morning after his disappearance
why did you not appeal to the law
why ah why stammered the banker with a slight display of emotion
andermatt if you had the least certainty of our guilt our little threat would not have stopped you
do you suppose i ever gave those letters a moment s thought
if you did not care for the letters why did you offer me thousands of francs for their return
and why did you have my brother and me tracked like wild beasts
you knew that as soon as you had the letters in your possession you could denounce us
he laughed heartily but stopped suddenly and said
we are merely going over old ground
we had better let things stand as they are
we will not let them stand as they are said the banker and since you have referred to the letters let me tell you that you will not leave this house until you deliver up those letters
i warn you i say you shall not go
we will see about that cried varin in such a rage that madame andermatt could not suppress a cry of fear
varin must have heard it for he now tried to force his way out
then i saw him put his hand into his coat pocket
for the last time let me pass he cried
varin drew a revolver and pointing it at mon
the weapon fell from varin s hand
it was daspry who had fired it at varin causing him to drop the revolver
in a moment daspry was standing between the two men facing varin he said to him with a sneer you were lucky my friend very lucky
i fired at your hand and struck only the revolver
both of them looked at him surprised
then he turned to the banker and said i beg your pardon monsieur for meddling in your business but really you play a very poor game
turning again to varin daspry said it s between us two comrade and play fair if you please
hearts are trumps and i play the seven
then daspry held up before varin s bewildered eyes the little iron plate marked with the seven red spots
it was a terrible shock to varin
with livid features staring eyes and an air of intense agony the man seemed to be hypnotized at the sight of it
one who meddles in other people s business down to the very bottom
yes you did or you wouldn t have come
this morning you received an invitation to come here at nine o clock and bring with you all the papers held by you
there was in daspry s voice and manner a tone of authority that i did not understand his manner was usually quite mild and conciliatory
absolutely conquered varin placed his hand on one of his pockets and said the papers are here
all that you took from louis lacombe and afterwards sold to major von lieben yes
are these the copies or the originals
why the major gave you only twenty thousand and that was like money thrown into the sea as the boat was a failure at the preliminary trials
they didn t understand the plans
then why do you ask me for them
i offer you five thousand francs not a sou more
agreed said daspry who now turned to mon
andermatt and said monsieur will kindly sign a check for the amount
andermatt examined the that daspry handed to him
no idle words monsieur if you please
the banker took out his fountain pen filled out the check and signed it
put down your hand said daspry there is something more
then to the banker he said you asked for some letters did you not
in that case you know where they are
you appear to be as well informed as salvator
were not daspry and salvator the same person
everything pointed to that conclusion
if so varin risked nothing in disclosing a already known
i have not got the seven of hearts
yes here it is said daspry handing him the iron plate
varin recoiled in terror and cried no no i will not
never mind replied daspry as he walked toward the bearded king climbed on a chair and applied the seven of hearts to the lower part of the sword in such a manner that the edges of the iron plate coincided exactly with the two edges of the sword
then with the assistance of an awl which he introduced alternately into each of the seven holes he pressed upon seven of the little mosaic stones
as he pressed upon the seventh one a clicking sound was heard and the entire bust of the king turned upon a pivot disclosing a large opening lined with steel
you can see varin the safe is empty
then my brother has taken out the letters
daspry stepped down from the chair approached varin and said now no more nonsense with me
monsieur andermatt are those letters worth ten thousand francs to you
varin closed the safe took the seven of hearts and placed it again on the sword at the same spot
he thrust the awl into each of the seven holes
there was the same clicking sound but this time strange to relate it was only a portion of the safe that revolved on the pivot disclosing quite a small safe that was built within the door of the larger one
the packet of letters was here tied with a tape and sealed
varin handed the packet to daspry
the latter turned to the banker and asked is the check ready monsieur andermatt yes
and you have also the last document that you received from louis lacombe the one that completes the plans of the yes
daspry pocketed the document and the checks and offered the packet of letters to mon
this is what you wanted monsieur
the banker hesitated a moment as if he were afraid to touch those cursed letters that he had sought so eagerly
then with a nervous movement he took them
i grasped madame andermatt s hand
i believe monsieur said daspry to the banker that our business is ended
it was only by a mere chance that i have been able to do you a good turn
he carried with him the letters written by his wife to louis lacombe
now we have only to close our little affair comrade
daspry examined them carefully and then placed them in his pocket
you have kept your word he said
well you have a great deal of assurance my man
can you ask pay for returning papers that you stole
he trembled with rage his eyes were bloodshot
the twenty thousand he stammered
the money come be reasonable and don t get excited
daspry seized his arm so forcibly that varin uttered a cry of pain
perhaps you want me to show you the way
yes we will go together to the vacant lot near here and i will show you a little mound of earth and stones and under it that is false
that little iron plate with the seven spots on it came from there
louis lacombe always carried it and you buried it with the body and with some other things that will prove very interesting to a judge and jury
varin covered his face with his hands and muttered all right i am beaten
but i want to ask you one question
was there a little casket in the large safe
was it there on the night of  june
everything that the varin brothers had put in it a very pretty collection of diamonds and pearls picked up here and there by the said brothers
it was the disappearance of that casket that caused my brother to kill himself
the disappearance of your correspondence was not a sufficient motive
but the disappearance of the casket
one thing more your name you ask that with an idea of seeking revenge
the man staggered as though stunned by a heavy blow
those two words had deprived him of all hope
daspry laughed and said ah did you imagine that a monsieur durand or dupont could manage an affair like this
no it required the skill and cunning of ars√®ne lupin
and now that you have my name go and prepare your revenge
then he pushed the bewildered varin through the door
i cried pushing aside the curtain
what s the matter madame andermatt is ill
he hastened to her caused her to inhale some salts and while caring for her questioned me well what did it
the letters of louis lacombe that you gave to her husband
he struck his forehead and said did she think that i could do such a thing
madame andermatt was now revived
daspry took from his pocket a small package exactly similar to the one that mon
but the others the others are the same rewritten by me and carefully worded
your husband will not find anything objectionable in them and will never suspect the substitution since they were taken from the safe in his presence
but the handwriting there is no handwriting that can not be imitated
she thanked him in the same words she might have used to a man in her own social circle so i concluded that she had not witnessed the final scene between varin and ars√®ne lupin
but the surprising revelation caused me considerable embarrassment
my club companion was none other than ars√®ne lupin
but he said quite at his ease you can say farewell to jean daspry
yes jean daspry is going on a long journey
there he may find a death worthy of him
i may say that that is his expectation
ars√®ne lupin is simply at the threshold of his career and he expects i was impelled by curiosity to interrupt him and leading him away from the hearing of madame andermatt i asked did you discover the smaller safe yourself the one that held the letters
yes after a great deal of trouble
i found it yesterday afternoon while you were asleep
and yet god knows it was simple enough
but the simplest things are the ones that usually escape our notice
then showing me the he added of course i had guessed that in order to open the larger safe this card must be placed on the sword of the mosaic king
through private information i knew that fact when i came here on the evening of  june after you left me yes after turning the subject of our conversation to stories of crime and robbery which were sure to reduce you to such a nervous condition that you would not leave your bed but would allow me to complete my search uninterrupted
well i knew when i came here that there was a casket concealed in a safe with a secret lock and that the was the key to that lock
i had merely to place the card upon the spot that was obviously intended for it
an hour s examination showed me where the spot was
one hour observe the fellow in mosaic
that old emperor is an exact representation of the king of hearts on all playing cards
but how does the seven of hearts open the larger safe at one time and the smaller safe at another time
and why did you open only the larger safe in the first instance
because i always placed the seven of hearts in the same way
but yesterday i observed that by reversing the card by turning it upside down the arrangement of the seven spots on the mosaic was changed
but a person has to think of those things
there is something else you did not know the history of those letters until madame andermatt spoke of them before me
because i found in the safe besides the casket nothing but the correspondence of the two brothers which disclosed their treachery in regard to the plans
then it was by chance that you were led first to investigate the history of the two brothers and then to search for the plans and documents relating to the
for what purpose did you make the search
mon dieu exclaimed daspry laughing how deeply interested you are
very well presently after i have escorted madame andermatt to a carriage and dispatched a short story to the
i will return and tell you all about it
he sat down and wrote one of those short articles which served to amuse and mystify the public
who does not recall the sensation that followed that article produced throughout the entire world
ars√®ne lupin has solved the problem recently submitted by salvator
having acquired possession of all the documents and original plans of the engineer louis lacombe he has placed them in the hands of the minister of marine and he has headed a subscription list for the purpose of presenting to the nation the first submarine constructed from those plans
his subscription is twenty thousand francs
i exclaimed when he had given me the paper to read
it was quite right that varin should redeem his treachery
and that is how i made the acquaintance of ars√®ne lupin
that is how i learned that jean daspry a member of my club was none other than ars√®ne lupin
that is how i formed very agreeable ties of friendship with that famous man and thanks to the confidence with which he honored me how i became his very humble and faithful historiographer
madame imbert s safe at three o clock in the morning there were still half a dozen carriages in front of one of those small houses which form only the side of the boulevard berthier
the door of that house opened and a number of guests male and female emerged
the majority of them entered their carriages and were quickly driven away leaving behind only two men who walked down courcelles where they parted as one of them lived in that street
the other decided to return on foot as far as the
it was a beautiful winter s night clear and cold a night on which a brisk walk is agreeable and refreshing
but at the end of a few minutes he had the disagreeable impression that he was being followed
turning around he saw a man skulking amongst the trees
he was not a coward yet he felt it advisable to increase his speed
then his pursuer commenced to run and he deemed it prudent to draw his revolver and face him
the man rushed at him and attacked him violently
immediately they were engaged in a desperate struggle wherein he felt that his unknown assailant had the advantage
he called for help struggled and was thrown down on a pile of gravel seized by the throat and gagged with a handkerchief that his assailant forced into his mouth
his eyes closed and the man who was smothering him with his weight arose to defend himself against an unexpected attack
a blow from a cane and a kick from a boot the man uttered two cries of pain and fled limping and cursing
without deigning to pursue the fugitive the new arrival stooped over the prostrate man and inquired are you hurt monsieur
he was not injured but he was dazed and unable to stand
his rescuer procured a carriage placed him in it and accompanied him to his house on the avenue de la
on his arrival there quite recovered he overwhelmed his saviour with thanks
i owe you my life monsieur and i shall not forget it
i do not wish to alarm my wife at this time of night but she will be pleased to thank you personally
imbert a card bearing the name ars√®ne lupin
at that time ars√®ne lupin did not enjoy the celebrity which the cahorn affair his escape from the prison de la sant√© and other brilliant exploits afterwards gained for him
he had not even used the name of ars√®ne lupin
the name was specially invented to designate the rescuer of mon
imbert that is to say it was in that affair that ars√®ne lupin was baptized
fully armed and ready for the fray it is true but lacking the resources and authority which command success ars√®ne lupin was then merely an apprentice in a profession wherein he soon became a master
with what a thrill of joy he recalled the invitation he received that night
at last he had reached his goal
at last he had undertaken a task worthy of his strength and skill
what a magnificent feast for an appetite like his
he prepared a special toilet for the occasion a shabby baggy trousers a frayed silk hat collar and cuffs all quite correct in form but bearing the unmistakable stamp of poverty
his cravat was a black ribbon pinned with a false diamond
thus accoutred he descended the stairs of the house in which he lived at montmartre
at the third floor without stopping he rapped on a closed door with the head of his cane
he walked to the exterior boulevards
he boarded it and some one who had been following him took a seat beside him
it was the lodger who occupied the room on the third floor
a moment later this man said to lupin well governor
how i am going there to breakfast
ludovic imbert from certain death at your hands
imbert is not devoid of gratitude
but you are not going to throw up the scheme
my dear boy said lupin when i arranged that little case of assault and battery when i took the trouble at three o clock in the morning to rap you with my cane and tap you with my boot at the risk of injuring my only friend it was not my intention to forego the advantages to be gained from a rescue so well arranged and executed
but the strange rumors we hear about their fortune never mind about that
for six months i have worked on this affair investigated it studied it questioned the servants the and men of straw for six months i have shadowed the husband and wife
consequently i know what i am talking about
whether the fortune came to them from old brawford as they pretend or from some other source i do not care
i know that it is a reality that it exists
one hundred millions let us say ten or even five that is enough
they have a safe full of bonds and there will be the devil to pay if i can t get my hands on them
the stopped at the place de l etoile
the man whispered to lupin what am i to do now
five minutes later ars√®ne lupin was ascending the magnificent flight of stairs in the imbert mansion and mon
imbert introduced him to his wife
madame gervaise imbert was a short plump woman and very talkative
she gave lupin a cordial welcome
i desired that we should be alone to entertain our saviour she said
from the outset they treated our saviour as an old and valued friend
by the time dessert was served their friendship was well cemented and private confidences were being exchanged
ars√®ne related the story of his life the life of his father as a magistrate the sorrows of his childhood and his present difficulties
gervaise in turn spoke of her youth her marriage the kindness of the aged brawford the hundred millions that she had inherited the obstacles that prevented her from obtaining the enjoyment of her inheritance the moneys she had been obliged to borrow at an exorbitant rate of interest her endless contentions with brawford s nephews and the litigation
just think of it monsieur lupin the bonds are there in my husband s office and if we detach a single coupon we lose everything
they are there in our safe and we dare not touch them
monsieur lupin shivered at the bare idea of his proximity to so much wealth
yet he felt quite certain that monsieur lupin would never suffer from the same difficulty as his fair hostess who declared she dare not touch the money
he repeated to himself they are there
a friendship formed under such circumstances soon led to closer relations
when discreetly questioned ars√®ne lupin confessed his poverty and distress
immediately the unfortunate young man was appointed private secretary to the imberts husband and wife at a salary of one hundred francs a month
he was to come to the house every day and receive orders for his work and a room on the second floor was set apart as his office
this room was directly over mon
ars√®ne soon realized that his position as secretary was essentially a sinecure
during the first two months he had only four important letters to recopy and was called only once to mon
imbert s office consequently he had only one opportunity to contemplate officially the imbert safe
moreover he noticed that the secretary was not invited to the social functions of the employer
but he did not complain as he preferred to remain modestly in the shade and maintain his peace and freedom
however he was not wasting any time
from the beginning he made clandestine visits to mon
imbert s office and paid his respects to the safe which was hermetically closed
it was an immense block of iron and steel cold and stern in appearance which could not be forced open by the ordinary tools of the burglar s trade
but ars√®ne lupin was not discouraged
where force fails cunning prevails he said to himself
the essential thing is to be on the spot when the opportunity occurs
in the meantime i must watch and wait
he made immediately some preliminary preparations
after careful soundings made upon the floor of his room he introduced a lead pipe which penetrated the ceiling of mon
imbert s office at a point between the two screeds of the cornice
by means of this pipe he hoped to see and hear what transpired in the room below
henceforth he passed his days stretched at full length upon the floor
he frequently saw the imberts holding a consultation in front of the safe investigating books and papers
when they turned the combination lock he tried to learn the figures and the number of turns they made to the right and left
he watched their movements he sought to catch their words
there was also a key necessary to complete the opening of the safe
one day he saw them leave the room without locking the safe
he descended the stairs quickly and boldly entered the room
oh excuse me he said i made a mistake in the door
come in monsieur lupin come in cried madame imbert are you not at home here
the foreign securities or the government annuities
but the injunction said lupin with surprise
she opened the door of the safe and withdrew a package of bonds
no no gervaise it would be foolish to sell the foreign bonds
they are going up whilst the annuities are as high as they ever will be
what do you think my dear friend
the dear friend had no opinion yet he advised the sacrifice of the annuities
then she withdrew another package and from it she took a paper at random
it proved to be a annuity worth two thousand francs
ludovic placed the package of bonds in his pocket
that afternoon accompanied by his secretary he sold the annuities to a and realized thousand francs
whatever madame imbert might have said about it ars√®ne lupin did not feel at home in the imbert house
on the contrary his position there was a peculiar one
he learned that the servants did not even know his name
ludovic always spoke of him in the same way you will tell monsieur
why that mysterious appellation
moreover after their first outburst of enthusiasm the imberts seldom spoke to him and although treating him with the consideration due to a benefactor they gave him little or no attention
they appeared to regard him as an eccentric character who did not like to be disturbed and they respected his isolation as if it were a stringent rule on his part
on one occasion while passing through the vestibule he heard madame imbert say to the two gentlemen
very well he said to himself i am a barbarian
and without seeking to solve the question of their strange conduct he proceeded with the execution of his own plans
he had decided that he could not depend on chance nor on the negligence of madame imbert who carried the key of the safe and who on locking the safe invariably scattered the letters forming the combination of the lock
consequently he must act for himself
finally an incident precipitated matters it was the vehement campaign instituted against the imberts by certain newspapers that accused the imberts of swindling
ars√®ne lupin was present at certain family conferences when this new vicissitude was discussed
he decided that if he waited much longer he would lose everything
during the next five days instead of leaving the house about six o clock according to his usual habit he locked himself in his room
it was supposed that he had gone out
but he was lying on the floor surveying the office of mon
during those five evenings the favorable opportunity that he awaited did not take place
he left the house about midnight by a side door to which he held the key
but on the sixth day he learned that the imberts actuated by the malevolent insinuations of their enemies proposed to make an inventory of the contents of the safe
and truly after dinner imbert and his wife retired to the office and commenced to examine the books of account and the securities contained in the safe
thus one hour after another passed away
he heard the servants go upstairs to their rooms
no one now remained on the first floor
i must get to work murmured lupin
outside everything was dark and quiet
he took from his desk a knotted rope fastened it to the balcony in front of his window and quietly descended as far as the window below which was that of the of imbert s office
he stood upon the balcony for a moment motionless with attentive ear and watchful eye but the heavy curtains effectually concealed the interior of the room
he cautiously pushed on the double window
if no one had examined it it ought to yield to the slightest pressure for during the afternoon he had so fixed the bolt that it would not enter the staple
the window yielded to his touch
then with infinite care he pushed it open sufficiently to admit his head
he parted the curtains a few inches looked in and saw mon
imbert and his wife sitting in front of the safe deeply absorbed in their work and speaking softly to each other at rare intervals
he calculated the distance between him and them considered the exact movements he would require to make in order to overcome them one after the other before they could call for help and he was about to rush upon them when madame imbert said ah the room is getting quite cold
and you my dear i shall stay and finish
why that will take you all night
twenty minutes thirty minutes passed
ars√®ne pushed the window a little farther open
imbert turned and seeing the curtains blown by the wind he rose to close the window
there was not a cry not the trace of struggle
with a few precise moments and without causing him the least injury ars√®ne stunned him wrapped the curtain about his head bound him hand and foot and did it all in such a manner that mon
imbert had no opportunity to recognize his assailant
quickly he approached the safe seized two packages that he placed under his arm left the office and opened the servants gate
a carriage was stationed in the street
take that first and follow me he said to the coachman
he returned to the office and in two trips they emptied the safe
then ars√®ne went to his own room removed the rope and all other traces of his clandestine work
a few hours later ars√®ne lupin and his assistant examined the stolen goods
lupin was not disappointed as he had foreseen that the wealth of the imberts had been greatly exaggerated
it did not consist of hundreds of millions nor even tens of millions
yet it amounted to a very respectable sum and lupin expressed his satisfaction
of course he said there will be a considerable loss when we come to sell the bonds as we will have to dispose of them surreptitiously at reduced prices
in the meantime they will rest quietly in my desk awaiting a propitious moment
ars√®ne saw no reason why he should not go to the imbert house the next day
but a perusal of the morning papers revealed this startling fact ludovic and gervaise imbert had disappeared
when the officers of the law seized the safe and opened it they found there what ars√®ne lupin had left nothing
such are the facts and i learned the sequel to them one day when ars√®ne lupin was in a confidential mood
he was pacing to and fro in my room with a nervous step and a feverish eye that were unusual to him
after all i said to him it was your most successful venture
without making a direct reply he said there are some impenetrable secrets connected with that affair some obscure points that escape my comprehension
for instance what caused their flight
why did they not take advantage of the help i unconsciously gave them
it would have been so simple to say the hundred millions were in the safe
they are no longer there because they have been stolen
yes that is it they lost their nerve on the other hand it is true what is true
what was the meaning of lupin s reticence
it was quite obvious that he had not told me everything there was something he was loath to tell
it must indeed be a very serious matter to cause such a man as ars√®ne lupin even a momentary hesitation
i threw out a few questions at random
and have you never experienced the slightest degree of pity for those unfortunate people
his sudden excitement astonished me
had i touched him on a sore spot
if you had not left them alone they might have been able to face the danger or at least made their escape with full pockets
i suppose you have an idea that my soul should be filled with remorse
call it remorse or regrets anything you like they are not worth it
have you no regrets or remorse for having stolen their fortune what fortune the packages of bonds you took from their safe
i deprived them of a portion of their wealth
my dear boy you do not know the truth
you never imagined that those bonds were not worth the paper they were written on
those bonds were false they were counterfeit every one of them do you understand
the four or five millions yes counterfeit
i couldn t raise a sou on the whole of them
and you ask me if i have any remorse
are the ones who should have remorse and pity
they played me for a simpleton and i fell into their trap
i was their latest victim their most stupid gull
he was affected by genuine anger the result of malice and wounded pride
he continued from start to finish i got the worst of it
do you know the part i played in that affair or rather the part they made me play
yes my boy that is the truth and i never suspected it
it was not until afterwards on reading the newspapers that the light finally dawned in my stupid brain
whilst i was posing as his saviour as the gentleman who had risked his life to rescue mon
imbert from the clutches of an assassin they were passing me off as brawford
that eccentric individual who had a room on the second floor that barbarian that was exhibited only at a distance was brawford and brawford was i
thanks to me and to the confidence that i inspired under the name of brawford they were enabled to borrow money from the bankers and other
what an experience for a novice
and i swear to you that i shall profit by the lesson
he stopped seized my arm and said to me in a tone of exasperation my dear fellow at this very moment gervaise imbert owes me fifteen hundred francs
i could not refrain from laughter his rage was so grotesque
he was making a mountain out of a molehill
in a moment he laughed himself and said yes my boy fifteen hundred francs
you must know that i had not received one sou of my promised salary and more than that she had borrowed from me the sum of fifteen hundred francs
i am giving you a straight story
she wanted it for some poor people she was assisting unknown to her husband
and my money was wormed out of me by that silly pretense
ars√®ne lupin done out of fifteen hundred francs by the fair lady from whom he stole four millions in counterfeit bonds
and what a vast amount of time and patience and cunning i expended to achieve that result
it was the first time in my life that i was played for a fool and i frankly confess that i was fooled that time to the queen s taste viii
the black pearl a violent ringing of the bell awakened the concierge of number nine avenue hoche
she pulled the doorstring grumbling i thought everybody was in
perhaps it is some one for the doctor muttered her husband
at that moment a voice inquired doctor harel
but the doctor won t go out at night
the visitor entered the vestibule ascended to the first floor the second the third and without stopping at the doctor s door he continued to the fifth floor
he murmured that simplifies the business wonderfully
but before i commence work i had better arrange for my retreat
have i had sufficient time to rouse the doctor and be dismissed by him
at the end of ten minutes he descended the stairs grumbling noisily about the doctor
the concierge opened the door for him and heard it click behind him
but the door did not lock as the man had quickly inserted a piece of iron in the lock in such a manner that the bolt could not enter
then quietly he entered the house again unknown to the concierge
in case of alarm his retreat was assured
noiselessly he ascended to the fifth floor once more
in the antechamber by the light of his electric lantern he placed his hat and overcoat on one of the chairs took a seat on another and covered his heavy shoes with felt slippers
ouf here i am and how simple it was
i wonder why more people do not adopt the profitable and pleasant occupation of burglar
with a little care and reflection it becomes a most delightful profession
not too quiet and monotonous of course as it would then become wearisome
he unfolded a detailed plan of the apartment
let me commence by locating myself
here i see the vestibule in which i am sitting
on the street front the the boudoir and
useless to waste any time there as it appears that the countess has a deplorable taste
not a bibelot of any value now let s get down to business
ah here is a corridor it must lead to the bed chambers
at a distance of three metres i should come to the door of the which connects with the chamber of the countess
he folded his plan extinguished his lantern and proceeded down the corridor counting his distance thus one metre two metres three metres
only a small simple bolt now separates me from the chamber and i know that the bolt is located exactly one metre centimeters from the floor
so that thanks to a small incision i am about to make i can soon get rid of the bolt
he drew from his pocket the necessary instruments
then the following idea occurred to him suppose by chance the door is not bolted
he turned the knob and the door opened
my brave lupin surely fortune favors you
you know the situation of the rooms you know the place in which the countess hides the black pearl
therefore in order to secure the black pearl you have simply to be more silent than silence more invisible than darkness itself
ars√®ne lupin was employed fully a in opening the second door a glass door that led to the countess bedchamber
but he accomplished it with so much skill and precaution that even had the countess been awake she would not have heard the slightest sound
according to the plan of the rooms that he holds he has merely to pass around a reclining chair and beyond that a small table close to the bed
on the table there was a box of and the black pearl was concealed in that box
he stooped and crept cautiously over the carpet following the outlines of the
when he reached the extremity of it he stopped in order to repress the throbbing of his heart
although he was not moved by any sense of fear he found it impossible to overcome the nervous anxiety that one usually feels in the midst of profound silence
that circumstance astonished him because he had passed through many more solemn moments without the slightest trace of emotion
then why did his heart throb like an
was it that sleeping woman who affected him
was it the proximity of another pulsating heart
he listened and thought he could discern the rhythmical breathing of a person asleep
it gave him confidence like the presence of a friend
he sought and found the armchair then by slow cautious movements advanced toward the table feeling ahead of him with outstretched arm
his right had touched one of the feet of the table
now he had simply to rise take the pearl and escape
that was fortunate as his heart was leaping in his breast like a wild beast and made so much noise that he feared it would waken the countess
by a powerful effort of the will he subdued the wild throbbing of his heart and was about to rise from the floor when his left hand encountered lying on the floor an object which he recognized as a candlestick an overturned candlestick
a moment later his hand encountered another object a clock one of those small traveling clocks covered with well
that candlestick that clock why were those articles not in their accustomed places
what had happened in the dread silence of the night
it is some fantasy of my excited brain
for twenty seconds thirty seconds he remained motionless terrified his forehead bathed with perspiration and his fingers still retained the sensation of that dreadful contact
making a desperate effort he ventured to extend his arm again
once more his hand encountered that strange unutterable thing
he must feel it and find out what it is
he found that it was hair human hair and a human face and that face was cold almost icy
however frightful the circumstances may be a man like ars√®ne lupin controls himself and commands the situation as soon as he learns what it is
so ars√®ne lupin quickly brought his lantern into use
a woman was lying before him covered with blood
her neck and shoulders were covered with gaping wounds
he leaned over her and made a closer examination
he repeated with a bewildered air
he stared at those fixed eyes that grim mouth that livid flesh and that blood all that blood which had flowed over the carpet and congealed there in thick black spots
he arose and turned on the electric lights
then he beheld all the marks of a desperate struggle
the bed was in a state of great disorder
on the floor the candlestick and the clock with the hands pointing to twenty minutes after eleven then further away an overturned chair and everywhere there was blood spots of blood and pools of blood
and the black pearl he murmured
you boasted of your good fortune much too soon my friend lupin
with the countess lying cold and dead and the black pearl vanished the situation is anything but pleasant
get out of here as soon as you can or you may get into serious trouble
any person would except ars√®ne lupin
now to proceed in an orderly way
at all events you have a clear conscience
let us suppose that you are the commissary of police and that you are proceeding to make an inquiry concerning this affair yes but in order to do that i require a clearer brain
he tumbled into an armchair with his clenched hands pressed against his burning forehead
the murder of the avenue hoche is one of those which have recently surprised and puzzled the parisian public and certainly i should never have mentioned the affair if the veil of mystery had not been removed by ars√®ne lupin himself
no one knew the exact truth of the case
who did not know from having met her in the bois the fair l√©otine zalti the cantatrice wife and widow of the count d andillot the zalti whose luxury dazzled all paris some twenty years ago the zalti who acquired an european reputation for the magnificence of her diamonds and pearls
it was said that she wore upon her shoulders the capital of several banking houses and the gold mines of numerous australian companies
skilful jewelers worked for zalti as they had formerly wrought for kings and queens
and who does not remember the catastrophe in which all that wealth was swallowed up
of all that marvelous collection nothing remained except the famous black pearl
that is to say a fortune if she had wished to part with it
but she preferred to keep it to live in a commonplace apartment with her companion her cook and a rather than sell that inestimable jewel
there was a reason for it a reason she was not afraid to disclose the black pearl was the gift of an emperor
almost ruined and reduced to the most mediocre existence she remained faithful to the companion of her happy and brilliant youth
the black pearl never left her possession
she wore it during the day and at night concealed it in a place known to her alone
all these facts being republished in the columns of the public press served to stimulate curiosity and strange to say but quite obvious to those who have the key to the mystery the arrest of the presumed assassin only complicated the question and prolonged the excitement
two days later the newspapers published the following item information has reached us of the arrest of victor dan√®gre the servant of the countess d andillot
the evidence against him is clear and convincing
on the silken sleeve of his liveried waistcoat which chief detective dudouis found in his garret between the mattresses of his bed several spots of blood were discovered
in addition a button was missing from that garment and this button was found beneath the bed of the victim
it is supposed that after dinner in place of going to his own room dan√®gre slipped into the and through the glass door had seen the countess hide the precious black pearl
this is simply a theory as yet unverified by any evidence
there is also another obscure point
at seven o clock in the morning dan√®gre went to the on the boulevard de courcelles the concierge and the both affirm this fact
on the other hand the countess companion and cook who sleep at the end of the hall both declare that when they arose at eight o clock the door of the antechamber and the door of the kitchen were locked
these two persons have been in the service of the countess for twenty years and are above suspicion
the question is how did dan√®gre leave the apartment
these are matters that the police will investigate
as a matter of fact the police investigation threw no light on the mystery
it was learned that victor dan√®gre was a dangerous criminal a drunkard and a debauchee
but as they proceeded with the investigation the mystery deepened and new complications arose
in the first place a young woman mlle
de sincl√®ves the cousin and sole heiress of the countess declared that the countess a month before her death had written a letter to her and in it described the manner in which the black pearl was concealed
the letter disappeared the day after she received it
again the concierge related how she had opened the door for a person who had inquired for doctor harel
on being questioned the doctor testified that no one had rung his bell
the theory of an accomplice was thereupon adopted by the press and public and also by ganimard the famous detective
lupin is at the bottom of this affair he said to the judge
bah exclaimed the judge you have lupin on the brain
i see him everywhere because he is everywhere
say rather that you see him every time you encounter something you can not explain
besides you overlook the fact that the crime was committed at twenty minutes past eleven in the evening as is shown by the clock while the nocturnal visit mentioned by the concierge occurred at three o clock in the morning
officers of the law frequently form a hasty conviction as to the guilt of a suspected person and then distort all subsequent discoveries to conform to their established theory
the deplorable antecedents of victor dan√®gre habitual criminal drunkard and rake influenced the judge and despite the fact that nothing new was discovered in corroboration of the early clues his official opinion remained firm and unshaken
he closed his investigation and a few weeks later the trial commenced
it proved to be slow and tedious
the judge was listless and the public prosecutor presented the case in a careless manner
under those circumstances dan√®gre s counsel had an easy task
he pointed out the defects and inconsistencies of the case for the prosecution and argued that the evidence was quite insufficient to convict the accused
who had made the key the indispensable key without which dan√®gre on leaving the apartment could not have locked the door behind him
who had ever seen such a key and what had become of it
who had seen the assassin s knife and where is it now
in any event argued the prisoner s counsel the prosecution must prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the prisoner committed the murder
the prosecution must show that the mysterious individual who entered the house at three o clock in the morning is not the guilty party
to be sure the clock indicated eleven o clock
the assassin could turn the hands of the clock to any hour he pleased and thus deceive us in regard to the exact hour of the crime
he left the prison on friday about dusk in the evening weak and depressed by his six months imprisonment
the inquisition the solitude the trial the deliberations of the jury combined to fill him with a nervous fear
at night he had been afflicted with terrible nightmares and haunted by weird visions of the scaffold
he was a mental and physical wreck
under the assumed name of anatole dufour he rented a small room on the heights of montmartre and lived by doing odd jobs wherever he could find them
three times he obtained regular employment only to be recognized and then discharged
sometimes he had an idea that men were following him detectives no doubt who were seeking to trap and denounce him
he could almost feel the strong hand of the law clutching him by the collar
one evening as he was eating his dinner at a neighboring restaurant a man entered and took a seat at the same table
he was a person about forty years of age and wore a of doubtful cleanliness
he ordered soup vegetables and a bottle of wine
after he had finished his soup he turned his eyes on dan√®gre and gazed at him intently
he was certain that this was one of the men who had been following him for several weeks
dan√®gre tried to rise but failed
his limbs refused to support him
the man poured himself a glass of wine and then filled dan√®gre s glass
the man raised his glass and said to your health victor dan√®gre
victor started in alarm and stammered i i
yes anatole dufour to the proprietor of this restaurant but victor dan√®gre to the officers of the law
the took a card from his pocket and handed it to victor who read on it grimaudan of the detective force
victor shuddered as he said you are connected with the police
no not now but i have a liking for the business and i continue to work at it in a manner more profitable
from time to time i strike upon a golden opportunity such as your case presents
i assure you it is a most promising affair provided you are inclined to be reasonable
oh my good fellow you are not in a position to refuse me anything i may ask
well i will inform you in a few words
i am sent by mademoiselle de sincl√®ves the heiress of the countess d andillot
to recover the black black pearl that you stole
if i had then i would be the assassin
fortunately for me monsieur the assizecourt was not of your opinion
the jury returned an unanimous verdict of acquittal
and when a man has a clear conscience and twelve good men in his favor the seized him by the arm and said no fine phrases my boy
now listen to me and weigh my words carefully
you will find they are worthy of your consideration
now dan√®gre three weeks before the murder you abstracted the cook s key to the servants door and had a duplicate key made by a locksmith named outard  rue oberkampf
after a silence grimaudan continued you killed the countess with a knife purchased by you at the bazar de la republique on the same day as you ordered the duplicate key
it has a triangular blade with a groove running from end to end
you are simply guessing at something you don t know
the continued there are some spots of rust upon it
shall i tell you how they came there
who can prove that they belong to me
the locksmith and the clerk from whom you bought the knife
i have already refreshed their memories and when you confront them they can not fail to recognize you
his speech was dry and hard with a tone of firmness and precision
dan√®gre was trembling with fear and yet he struggled desperately to maintain an air of indifference
is that all the evidence you have
for instance after the crime you went out the same way you had entered
but in the centre of the being seized by some sudden fear you leaned against the wall for support
no one could know such a thing argued the desperate man
the police know nothing about it of course
they never think of lighting a candle and examining the walls
but if they had done so they would have found on the white plaster a faint red spot quite distinct however to trace in it the imprint of your thumb which you had pressed against the wall while it was wet with blood
now as you are well aware under the bertillon system are one of the principal means of identification
victor dan√®gre was livid great drops of perspiration rolled down his face and fell upon the table
he gazed with a wild look at the strange man who had narrated the story of his crime as faithfully as if he had been an invisible witness to it
overcome and powerless victor bowed his head
he felt that it was useless to struggle against this marvelous man
so he said how much will you give me if i give you the pearl nothing
or do you mean that i should give you an article worth thousands and hundreds of thousands and get nothing in return
then grimaudan added in a milder tone come dan√®gre that pearl has no value in your hands
it is quite impossible for you to sell it so what is the use of your keeping it
and some day i will be able to get something for it
why because by that time you may be in the hands of the police and with the evidence that i can furnish the knife the key the what will become of you
victor rested his head on his hands and reflected
he felt that he was lost irremediably lost and at the same time a sense of weariness and depression overcame him
he murmured faintly when must i give it to you
if i refuse if you refuse i shall post this letter to the procureur of the republic in which letter mademoiselle de sincl√®ves denounces you as the assassin
dan√®gre poured out two glasses of wine which he drank in rapid succession then rising said pay the bill and let us go
i have had enough of the cursed affair
the two men walked down the rue lepic and followed the exterior boulevards in the direction of the place de l etoile
they pursued their way in silence victor had a stooping carriage and a dejected face
when they reached the parc monceau he said we are near the house
you only left the house once before your arrest and that was to go to the
here it is said dan√®gre in a dull voice
they passed along the garden wall of the countess house and crossed a street on a corner of which stood the
a few steps further on dan√®gre stopped his limbs shook beneath him and he sank to a bench
what now demanded his companion
exclaimed grimaudan you want me to pay for the information
no but i am afraid i will starve to death
enough to buy a steerage pass to america
and a hundred francs to keep me until i get work there
count the to the right from the
the pearl is between the twelfth and thirteenth
in the gutter yes close to the sidewalk
grimaudan glanced around to see if anyone were looking
some and pedestrians were passing
but bah they will not suspect anything
he opened his pocketknife and thrust it between the twelfth and thirteenth stones
it must be there unless someone saw me stoop down and hide it
could it be possible that the black pearl had been cast into the mud and filth of the gutter to be picked up by the first comer
the point of his knife struck something
he enlarged the hole with his finger
then he abstracted the black pearl from its filthy
here are your two hundred francs
i will send you the ticket for america
on the following day this article was published in the de and was copied by the leading newspapers throughout the world
yesterday the famous black pearl came into the possession of ars√®ne lupin who recovered it from the murderer of the countess d andillot
in a short time of that precious jewel will be exhibited in london petersburg calcutta buenos ayres and new york
ars√®ne lupin will be pleased to consider all propositions submitted to him through his agents
and that is how crime is always punished and virtue rewarded said ars√®ne lupin after he had told me the foregoing history of the black pearl
and that is how you under the assumed name of grimaudan of detectives were chosen by fate to deprive the criminal of the benefit of his crime
and i confess that the affair gives me infinite satisfaction and pride
the forty minutes that i passed in the apartment of the countess d andillot after learning of her death were the most thrilling and absorbing moments of my life
in those forty minutes involved as i was in a most dangerous plight i calmly studied the scene of the murder and reached the conclusion that the crime must have been committed by one of the house servants
i also decided that in order to get the pearl that servant must be arrested and so i left the wainscoat button it was necessary also for me to hold some convincing evidence of his guilt so i carried away the knife which i found upon the floor and the key which i found in the lock
i closed and locked the door and erased the from the plaster in the
in my opinion that was one of those flashes of genius i said interrupting
but i flatter myself it would not have occurred to the average mortal
to frame instantly the two elements of the problem an arrest and an acquittal to make use of the formidable machinery of the law to crush and humble my victim and reduce him to a condition in which when free he would be certain to fall into the trap i was laying for him
poor devil poor devil do you say
he might have descended to the lowest depths of vice and crime if he had retained the black pearl
think of that victor dan√®gre is alive
he took it out of one of the secret pockets of his wallet examined it gazed at it tenderly and caressed it with loving fingers and sighed as he said what cold russian prince what vain and foolish rajah may some day possess this priceless treasure
or perhaps some american millionaire is destined to become the owner of this morsel of exquisite beauty that once adorned the fair bosom of leontine zalti the countess d andillot
sherlock holmes arrives too late it is really remarkable velmont what a close resemblance you bear to ars√®ne lupin
oh like everyone else from photographs no two of which are alike but each of them leaves the impression of a face
horace velmont displayed some vexation
and believe me you are not the first one who has noticed it
it is so striking persisted devanne that if you had not been recommended to me by my cousin d estevan and if you were not the celebrated artist whose beautiful marine views i so admire i have no doubt i should have warned the police of your presence in dieppe
this sally was greeted with an outburst of laughter
the large of the ch√¢teau de thibermesnil contained on this occasion besides velmont the following guests father g√©lis the parish priest and a dozen officers whose regiments were quartered in the vicinity and who had accepted the invitation of the banker georges devanne and his mother
one of the officers then remarked i understand that an exact description of ars√®ne lupin has been furnished to all the police along this coast since his daring exploit on the express
that was three months ago and a week later i made the acquaintance of our friend velmont at the casino and since then he has honored me with several visits an agreeable preamble to a more serious visit that he will pay me one of these days or rather one of these nights
this speech evoked another round of laughter and the guests then passed into the ancient hall of the guards a vast room with a high ceiling which occupied the entire lower part of the tour guillaume william s tower and wherein georges devanne had collected the incomparable treasures which the lords of thibermesnil had accumulated through many centuries
it contained ancient chests credences andirons and chandeliers
the stone walls were overhung with magnificent tapestries
the deep embrasures of the four windows were furnished with benches and the gothic windows were composed of small panes of colored glass set in a leaden frame
between the door and the window to the left stood an immense bookcase of renaissance style on the pediment of which in letters of gold was the word thibermesnil and below it the proud family device fais ce que veulx do what thou wishest
when the guests had lighted their cigars devanne resumed the conversation
and remember velmont you have no time to lose in fact is the last chance you will have
how so asked the painter who appeared to regard the affair as a joke
devanne was about to reply when his mother mentioned to him to keep silent but the excitement of the occasion and a desire to interest his guests urged him to speak
the guests drew closer and he commenced to speak with the satisfied air of a man who has an important announcement to make
afternoon at four o clock sherlock holmes the famous english detective for whom such a thing as mystery does not exist sherlock holmes the most remarkable solver of enigmas the world has ever known that marvelous man who would seem to be the creation of a romantic novelist sherlock holmes will be my guest
immediately devanne was the target of numerous eager questions
is sherlock holmes really coming
is ars√®ne lupin really in this neighborhood
ars√®ne lupin and his band are not far away
besides the robbery of the baron cahorn he is credited with the thefts at montigny gruchet and crasville
has he sent you a warning as he did to baron cahorn no replied devanne he can t work the same trick twice
he rose and pointing to a small empty space between the two enormous folios on one of the shelves of the bookcase he said there used to be a book there a book of the sixteenth century entitled chronique de thibermesnil which contained the history of the castle since its construction by duke rollo on the site of a former feudal fortress
there were three engraved plates in the book one of which was a general view of the whole estate another the plan of the buildings and the third i call your attention to it particularly the third was the sketch of a subterranean passage an entrance to which is outside the first line of ramparts while the other end of the passage is here in this very room
well that book disappeared a month ago
the deuce said velmont that looks bad
but it doesn t seem to be a sufficient reason for sending for sherlock holmes
certainly that was not sufficient in itself but another incident happened that gives the disappearance of the book a special significance
there was another copy of this book in the national library at paris and the two books differed in certain details relating to the subterranean passage for instance each of them contained drawings and annotations not printed but written in ink and more or less effaced
i knew those facts and i knew that the exact location of the passage could be determined only by a comparison of the two books
now the day after my book disappeared the book was called for in the national library by a reader who carried it away and no one knows how the theft was effected
the guests uttered many exclamations of surprise
certainly the affair looks serious said one
well the police investigated the matter and as usual discovered no clue whatever
they never do when ars√®ne lupin is concerned in it
exactly and so i decided to ask the assistance of sherlock holmes who replied that he was ready and anxious to enter the lists with ars√®ne lupin
what glory for ars√®ne lupin said velmont
but if our national thief as they call him has no evil designs on your castle sherlock holmes will have his trip in vain
there are other things that will interest him such as the discovery of the subterranean passage
but you told us that one end of the passage was outside the ramparts and the other was in this very room
yes but in what part of the room
the line which represents the passage on the charts ends here with a small circle marked with the letters which no doubt stand for tour guillaume
but the tower is round and who can tell the exact spot at which the passage touches the tower
devanne lighted a second cigar and poured himself a glass of benedictine
his guests pressed him with questions and he was pleased to observe the interest that his remarks had created
then he continued the secret is lost
the legend is to the effect that the former lords of the castle transmitted the secret from father to son on their deathbeds until geoffroy the last of the race was beheaded during the revolution in his nineteenth year
surely someone has looked for it since that time
after i purchased the castle i made a diligent search for it but without success
you must remember that this tower is surrounded by water and connected with the castle only by a bridge consequently the passage must be underneath the old moat
the plan that was in the book in the national library showed a series of stairs with a total of steps which indicates a depth of more than ten meters
you see the mystery lies within the walls of this room and yet i dislike to tear them down
is there nothing to show where it is nothing
devanne we should turn our attention to the two quotations suggested father g√©lis
devanne laughing our worthy father is fond of reading memoirs and delving into the musty archives of the castle
everything relating to thibermesnil interests him greatly
but the quotations that he mentions only serve to complicate the mystery
he has read somewhere that two kings of france have known the key to the puzzle
henry the fourth and louis the sixteenth
and the legend runs like this on the eve of the battle of arques henry the fourth spent the night in this castle
at eleven o clock in the evening louise de tancarville the prettiest woman in normandy was brought into the castle through the subterranean passage by duke edgard who at the same time informed the king of the secret passage
afterward the king confided the secret to his minister sully who in turn relates the story in his book royales economies d etat without making any comment upon it but linking with it this incomprehensible sentence turn one eye on the bee that shakes the other eye will lead to god
after a brief silence velmont laughed and said certainly it doesn t throw a dazzling light upon the subject
no but father g√©lis claims that sully concealed the key to the mystery in this strange sentence in order to keep the secret from the secretaries to whom he dictated his memoirs
that is an ingenious theory said velmont
yes and it may be nothing more i can not see that it throws any light on the mysterious riddle
and was it also to receive the visit of a lady that louis the sixteenth caused the passage to be opened
all i can say is that the king stopped here one night in  and that the famous iron casket found in the louvre contained a paper bearing these words in the king s own writing thibermesnil
horace velmont laughed heartily and exclaimed at last
and now that we have the magic key where is the man who can fit it to the invisible lock laugh as much as you please monsieur said father g√©lis but i am confident the solution is contained in those two sentences and some day we will find a man able to interpret them
sherlock holmes is the man said mon
devanne unless ars√®ne lupin gets ahead of him
velmont arose placed his hand on devanne s shoulder and declared i think that the information furnished by your book and the book of the national library was deficient in a very important detail which you have now supplied
now that i have it i can go to work at once said velmont
of course without losing a minute said devanne smiling
before the arrival of sherlock holmes i must plunder your castle
by the way i can drive you over this evening
to dieppe yes i am going to meet monsieur and madame d androl and a young lady of their acquaintance who are to arrive by the midnight train
then addressing the officers devanne added gentlemen i shall expect to see all of you at breakfast
the company dispersed and a few moments later devanne and velmont were speeding toward dieppe in an automobile
devanne dropped the artist in front of the casino and proceeded to the railway station
at twelve o clock his friends alighted from the train
a half hour later the automobile was at the entrance to the castle
at one o clock after a light supper they retired
the lights were extinguished and the castle was enveloped in the darkness and silence of the night
the moon appeared through a rift in the clouds and filled the with its bright white light
then the moon again retired behind its ethereal draperies and darkness and silence reigned supreme
no sound could be heard save the monotonous ticking of the clock
it struck two and then continued its endless repetitions of the seconds
suddenly something clicked like the opening and closing of a that warns the passing train
a thin stream of light flashed to every corner of the room like an arrow that leaves behind it a trail of light
it shot forth from the central fluting of a column that supported the pediment of the bookcase
it rested for a moment on the panel opposite like a glittering circle of burnished silver then flashed in all directions like a guilty eye that scrutinizes every shadow
it disappeared for a short time but burst forth again as a whole section of the bookcase revolved on a pivot and disclosed a large opening like a vault
a man entered carrying an electric lantern
he was followed by a second man who carried a coil of rope and various tools
the leader inspected the room listened a moment and said call the others
then eight men stout fellows with resolute faces entered the room and immediately commenced to remove the furnishings
ars√®ne lupin passed quickly from one piece of furniture to another examined each and according to its size or artistic value he directed his men to take it or leave it
if ordered to be taken it was carried to the gaping mouth of the tunnel and ruthlessly thrust into the bowels of the earth
such was the fate of six armchairs six small louis xv chairs a quantity of aubusson tapestries some candelabra paintings by fragonard and nattier a bust by houdon and some statuettes
sometimes lupin would linger before a beautiful chest or a superb picture and sigh that is too heavy too large
in forty minutes the room was dismantled and it had been accomplished in such an orderly manner and with as little noise as if the various articles had been packed and wadded for the occasion
lupin said to the last man who departed by way of the tunnel you need not come back
you understand that as soon as the is loaded you are to proceed to the grange at roquefort
when the man had disappeared ars√®ne lupin pushed the section of the bookcase back into its place carefully effaced the traces of the men s footsteps raised a porti√®re and entered a gallery which was the only means of communication between the tower and the castle
in the center of this gallery there was a glass cabinet which had attracted lupin s attentions
it contained a valuable collection of watches rings chatelaines and miniatures of rare and beautiful workmanship
he forced the lock with a small jimmy and experienced a great pleasure in handling those gold and silver ornaments those exquisite and delicate works of art
he carried a large linen bag specially prepared for the removal of such
then he filled the pockets of his coat waistcoat and trousers
and he was just placing over his left arm a number of pearl reticules when he heard a slight sound
then he remembered that at one end of the gallery there was a stairway leading to an unoccupied apartment but which was probably occupied that night by the young lady whom mon
devanne had brought from dieppe with his other visitors
immediately he extinguished his lantern and had scarcely gained the friendly shelter of a when the door at the top of the stairway was opened and a feeble light illuminated the gallery
he could feel for concealed by a curtain he could not see that a woman was cautiously descending the upper steps of the stairs
he hoped she would come no closer
yet she continued to descend and even advanced some distance into the room
no doubt she had discovered the broken and dismantled cabinet
now he could smell the perfume and hear the throbbing of her heart as she drew closer to the window where he was concealed
she passed so close that her skirt brushed against the and lupin felt that she suspected the presence of another behind her in the shadow within reach of her hand
the candle that she carried in her trembling hand grew brighter
she turned hesitated a moment appeared to listen then suddenly drew aside the curtain
he murmured involuntarily you you mademoiselle
his fellow passenger on the transatlantic steamer who had been the subject of his dreams on that memorable voyage who had been a witness to his arrest and who rather than betray him had dropped into the water the kodak in which he had concealed the and diamonds
that charming creature the memory of whose face had sometimes cheered sometimes saddened the long hours of imprisonment
it was such an unexpected encounter that brought them face to face in that castle at that hour of the night that they could not move nor utter a word they were amazed hypnotized each at the sudden apparition of the other
trembling with emotion miss nelly staggered to a seat
he remained standing in front of her
gradually he realized the situation and conceived the impression he must have produced at that moment with his arms laden with and his pockets and a linen sack overflowing with plunder
he was overcome with confusion and he actually blushed to find himself in the position of a thief caught in the act
to her henceforth he was a thief a man who puts his hand in another s pocket who steals into houses and robs people while they sleep
a watch fell upon the floor then another
these were followed by other articles which slipped from his grasp one by one
then actuated by a sudden decision he dropped the other articles into an armchair emptied his pockets and unpacked his sack
he felt very uncomfortable in nelly s presence and stepped toward her with the intention of speaking to her but she shuddered rose quickly and fled toward the salon
she was standing trembling and amazed at the sight of the devastated room
he said to her at once at three o clock everything will be returned
the furniture will be brought back
she made no reply so he repeated i promise it
nothing in the world could induce me to break that promise at three o clock
then followed a long silence that he dared not break whilst the agitation of the young girl caused him a feeling of genuine regret
quietly without a word he turned away thinking i hope she will go away
but the young girl suddenly spoke and stammered listen footsteps
he looked at her with astonishment
she seemed to be overwhelmed by the thought of approaching peril
but you must go you must escape
oh do not remain here another minute
she ran quickly to the door leading to the gallery and listened
she waited a moment then returned reassured
but ars√®ne lupin had disappeared
devanne was informed of the pillage of his castle he said to himself it was velmont who did it and velmont is ars√®ne lupin
that theory explained everything and there was no other plausible explanation
and yet the idea seemed preposterous
it was ridiculous to suppose that velmont was anyone else than velmont the famous artist and of his cousin d estevan
so when the captain of the gendarmes arrived to investigate the affair devanne did not even think of mentioning his absurd theory
throughout the forenoon there was a lively commotion at the castle
the gendarmes the local police the chief of police from dieppe the villagers all circulated to and fro in the halls examining every nook and corner that was open to their inspection
the approach of the maneuvering troops the rattling fire of the musketry added to the picturesque character of the scene
the preliminary search furnished no clue
neither the doors nor windows showed any signs of having been disturbed
consequently the removal of the goods must have been effected by means of the secret passage
yet there were no indications of footsteps on the floor nor any unusual marks upon the walls
their investigations revealed however one curious fact that denoted the whimsical character of ars√®ne lupin the famous chronique of the sixteenth century had been restored to its accustomed place in the library and beside it there was a similar book which was none other than the volume stolen from the national library
at eleven o clock the military officers arrived
devanne welcomed them with his usual gayety for no matter how much chagrin he might suffer from the loss of his artistic treasures his great wealth enabled him to bear his loss philosophically
his guests monsieur and madame d androl and miss nelly were introduced and it was then noticed that one of the expected guests had not arrived
his absence had awakened the suspicions of mon
but at twelve o clock he arrived
devanne exclaimed ah here you are
why am i not punctual asked velmont
yes and i am surprised that you are after such a busy night
nonsense exclaimed velmont smiling
but first escort miss underdown to the
mademoiselle allow me he stopped as he remarked the extreme agitation of the young girl
then recalling the incident he said ah of course you met ars√®ne lupin on the steamer before his arrest and you are astonished at the resemblance
velmont stood before her smiling
he escorted her to her place and took his seat opposite her
during the breakfast the conversation related exclusively to ars√®ne lupin the stolen goods the secret passage and sherlock holmes
it was only at the close of the repast when the conversation had drifted to other subjects that velmont took any part in it
then he was by turns amusing and grave talkative and pensive
and all his remarks seemed to be directed to the young girl
but she quite absorbed did not appear to hear them
coffee was served on the terrace overlooking the court of honor and the flower garden in front of the principal fa√ßade
the regimental band played on the lawn and scores of soldiers and peasants wandered through the park
miss nelly had not forgotten for one moment lupin s solemn promise at three o clock everything will be returned
and the hands of the great clock in the right wing of the castle now marked twenty minutes to three
in spite of herself her eyes wandered to the clock every minute
she also watched velmont who was calmly swinging to and fro in a comfortable rocking chair
nelly was impatient and anxious
was it possible that ars√®ne lupin would carry out his promise at the appointed hour when the castle the courtyard and the park were filled with people and at the very moment when the officers of the law were pursuing their investigations
ars√®ne lupin had given her his solemn promise
it will be exactly as he said thought she so deeply was she impressed with the authority energy and assurance of that remarkable man
to her it no longer assumed the form of a miracle but on the contrary a natural incident that must occur in the ordinary course of events
she blushed and turned her head
the great clock struck slowly one two
three horace velmont took out his watch glanced at the clock then returned the watch to his pocket
a few seconds passed in silence and then the crowd in the courtyard parted to give passage to two wagons that had just entered the each drawn by two horses
they were such as are used for the transportation of provisions tents and other necessary military stores
they stopped in front of the main entrance and a leaped from one of the wagons and inquired for mon
a moment later that gentleman emerged from the house descended the steps and under the canvas covers of the wagons beheld his furniture pictures and ornaments carefully packaged and arranged
when questioned the sergeant produced an order that he had received from the officer of the day
by that order the second company of the fourth battalion were commanded to proceed to the crossroads of halleux in the forest of arques gather up the furniture and other articles deposited there and deliver same to monsieur georges devanne owner of the thibermesnil castle at three o clock
at the crossroads explained the sergeant we found everything ready lying on the grass guarded by some
it seemed very strange but the order was imperative
one of the officers examined the signature
he declared it a forgery but a clever imitation
the wagons were unloaded and the goods restored to their proper places in the castle
during this commotion nelly had remained alone at the extreme end of the terrace absorbed by confused and distracted thoughts
suddenly she observed velmont approaching her
she would have avoided him but the balustrade that surrounded the terrace cut off her retreat
a gleam of sunshine passing through the scant foliage of a bamboo lighted up her beautiful golden hair
some one spoke to her in a low voice have i not kept my promise
ars√®ne lupin stood close to her
he repeated in a calm soft voice have i not kept my promise
he expected a word of thanks or at least some slight movement that would betray her interest in the fulfillment of his promise
her scornful attitude annoyed ars√®ne lupin and he realized the vast distance that separated him from miss nelly now that she had learned the truth
he would gladly have justified himself in her eyes or at least pleaded extenuating circumstances but he perceived the absurdity and futility of such an attempt
finally dominated by a surging flood of memories he murmured ah how long ago that was
you remember the long hours on the deck of the provence
then you carried a rose in your hand a white rose like the one you carry
you pretended you did not hear me
after you had gone away i found the rose forgotten no doubt and i kept it
he continued in memory of those happy hours forget what you have learned since
separate the past from the present
do not regard me as the man you saw last night but look at me if only for a moment as you did in those days when i was bernard d andrezy for a short time
she raised her eyes and looked at him as he had requested
then without saying a word she pointed to a ring he was wearing on his forefinger
only the ring was visible but the setting which was turned toward the palm of his hand consisted of a magnificent ruby
the ring belonged to georges devanne
he smiled bitterly and said you are right
ars√®ne lupin is now and always will be ars√®ne lupin
to you he can not be even so much as a memory
i should have known that any attention i may now offer you is simply an insult
he was inclined to detain her and beseech her forgiveness
but his courage failed and he contented himself by following her with his eyes as he had done when she descended the gangway to the pier at new york
she mounted the steps leading to the door and disappeared within the house
ars√®ne lupin stood watching the imprints of her tiny feet in the sand
upon the box which contained the bamboo beside which nelly had been standing he saw the rose the white rose which he had desired but dared not ask for
but how designedly or through distraction
some of its petals fell to the ground
he picked them up one by one like precious relics
he said to himself i have nothing more to do here
i must think of my safety before sherlock holmes arrives
the park was deserted but some gendarmes were stationed at the
he entered a grove of pine trees leaped over the wall and as a short cut to the railroad station followed a path across the fields
after walking about ten minutes he arrived at a spot where the road grew narrower and ran between two steep banks
in this ravine he met a man traveling in the opposite direction
it was a man about fifty years of age tall and wearing clothes of a foreign cut
he carried a heavy cane and a small satchel was strapped across his shoulder
when they met the stranger spoke with a slight english accent excuse me monsieur is this the way to the castle
yes monsieur straight ahead and turn to the left when you come to the wall
yes my friend devanne told us last night that you were coming and i am delighted to be the first to welcome you
sherlock holmes has no more ardent admirer than myself
there was a touch of irony in his voice that he quickly regretted for sherlock holmes scrutinized him from head to foot with such a keen penetrating eye that ars√®ne lupin experienced the sensation of being seized imprisoned and registered by that look more thoroughly and precisely than he had ever been by a camera
my negative is taken now he thought and it will be useless to use a disguise with that man
but i wonder has he recognized me
they bowed to each other as if about to part
but at that moment they heard a sound of horses feet accompanied by a clinking of steel
the two men were obliged to draw back against the embankment amongst the brushes to avoid the horses
the gendarmes passed by but as they followed each other at a considerable distance they were several minutes in doing so
and lupin was thinking it all depends on that question has he recognized me
if so he will probably take advantage of the opportunity
when the last horseman had passed sherlock holmes stepped forth and brushed the dust from his clothes
then for a moment he and ars√®ne lupin gazed at each other and if a person could have seen them at that moment it would have been an interesting sight and memorable as the first meeting of two remarkable men so strange so powerfully equipped both of superior quality and destined by fate through their peculiar attributes to hurl themselves one at the other like two equal forces that nature opposes one against the other in the realms of space
then the englishman said thank you monsieur
you are quite welcome replied ars√®ne lupin
lupin went toward the railway station and sherlock holmes continued on his way to the castle
the local officers had given up the investigation after several hours of fruitless efforts and the people at the castle were awaiting the arrival of the english detective with a lively curiosity
at first sight they were a little disappointed on account of his commonplace appearance which differed so greatly from the pictures they had formed of him in their own minds
he did not in any way resemble the romantic hero the mysterious and diabolical personage that the name of sherlock holmes had evoked in their imaginations
devanne exclaimed with much gusto ah monsieur you are here
really i scarcely regret what has happened since it affords me the opportunity to meet you
but i sent my automobile to meet you at the station
an official reception eh with music and fireworks
that is not the way i do business grumbled the englishman
this speech disconcerted devanne who replied with a forced smile
fortunately the business has been greatly simplified since i wrote to you
in what way the robbery took place last night
if you had not announced my intended visit it is probable the robbery would not have been committed last night
and in that case lupin would have been trapped said the detective
and my furniture would not have been carried away
they were brought back at three o clock
sherlock holmes put on his cap and adjusted his satchel
devanne exclaimed anxiously but monsieur what are you going to do
why your goods have been returned ars√®ne lupin is far away there is nothing for me to do
what happened yesterday may happen again as we do not know how he entered or how he escaped or why a few hours later he returned the goods
the idea of a problem to be solved quickened the interest of sherlock holmes
very well let us make a search at once and alone if possible
devanne understood and conducted the englishman to the salon
in a dry crisp voice in sentences that seemed to have been prepared in advance holmes asked a number of questions about the events of the preceding evening and enquired also concerning the guests and the members of the household
then he examined the two volumes of the chronique compared the plans of the subterranean passage requested a repetition of the sentences discovered by father g√©lis and then asked was yesterday the first time you have spoken those two sentences to any one
you had never communicated then to horace velmont
in an hour yes within that time ars√®ne lupin solved the problem that you placed before him
i placed before him yes ars√®ne lupin or horace velmont same thing
now let us see said holmes last night at ten o clock you furnished lupin with the information that he lacked and that he had been seeking for many weeks
during the night he found time to solve the problem collect his men and rob the castle
i shall be quite as expeditious
he walked from end to end of the room in deep thought then sat down crossed his long legs and closed his eyes
devanne waited quite embarrassed
however he left the room to give some orders and when he returned he found the detective on his knees scrutinizing the carpet at the foot of the stairs in the gallery
and you will also find them at the top of the stairs and around the cabinet that ars√®ne lupin broke into and from which he took the bibelots that he afterward placed in this armchair
these facts would doubtless explain the cause for the restitution but that is a side issue that i can not wait to investigate
the main question is the secret passage
first tell me is there a chapel some two or three hundred metres from the castle
yes a ruined chapel containing the tomb of duke tell your chauffer to wait for us near that chapel
if he had they would have informed me
do you think the secret passage runs to the chapel
what reason have i would ask you monsieur interrupted the detective to furnish me with a ladder and a lantern
do you require a ladder and a lantern
certainly or i shouldn t have asked for them
devanne somewhat disconcerted by this crude logic rang the bell
the two articles were given with the sternness and precision of military commands
place the ladder against the bookcase to the left of the word devanne placed the ladder as directed and the englishman continued more to the left to the right there
all the letters are in relief aren t they
first turn the letter i one way or the other
devanne took hold of the letter and exclaimed ah
sherlock holmes did not reply to the question but continued his directions now take the letter b move it back and forth as you would a bolt
devanne did so and to his great surprise it produced a clicking sound
now we will go to the other end of the word thibermesnil try the letter i and see if it will open like a wicket
with a certain degree of solemnity devanne seized the letter
it opened but devanne fell from the ladder for the entire section of the bookcase lying between the first and last letters of the words turned on a pivot and disclosed the subterranean passage
sherlock holmes said coolly you are not hurt
no no said devanne as he rose to his feet not hurt only bewildered
doesn t that agree exactly with the formula given by sully
turn one eye on the bee that shakes the other eye will lead to god
but louis the sixteenth asked devanne
louis the sixteenth was a clever locksmith
i have read a book he wrote about combination locks
it was a good idea on the part of the owner of thibermesnil to show his majesty a clever bit of mechanism
as an aid to his memory the king wrote that is to say the third fourth and eleventh letters of the word
it explains how lupin got out of the room but it does not explain how he entered
and it is certain he came from the outside
sherlock holmes lighted his lantern and stepped into the passage
all the mechanism is exposed here like the works of a clock and the reverse side of the letters can be reached
lupin worked the combination from this side that is all
lupin foresaw that the wheels would require oiling
did he know about the other entrance
as well as i know it said holmes
into that dark passage are you afraid
no but are you sure you can find the way out
at first they descended twelve steps then twelve more and farther on two other flights of twelve steps each
then they walked through a long passageway the brick walls of which showed the marks of successive restorations and in spots were dripping with water
we are passing under the pond said devanne somewhat nervously
at last they came to a stairway of twelve steps followed by three others of twelve steps each which they mounted with difficulty and then found themselves in a small cavity cut in the rock
muttered holmes nothing but bare walls
i have seen enough to satisfy me
but the englishman raised his eye and uttered a sigh of relief
there he saw the same mechanism and the same word as before
he had merely to work the three letters
he did so and a block of granite swung out of place
on the other side this granite block formed the tombstone of duke rollo and the word thibermesnil was engraved on it in relief
now they were in the little ruined chapel and the detective said
the other eye leads to god that means to the chapel
exclaimed devanne amazed at the clairvoyance and vivacity of the englishman
can it be possible that those few words were sufficient for you
bah declared holmes they weren t even necessary
in the chart in the book of the national library the drawing terminates at the left as you know in a circle and at the right as you do not know in a cross
now that cross must refer to the chapel in which we now stand
poor devanne could not believe his ears
it was all so new so novel to him
he exclaimed it is incredible miraculous and yet of a childish simplicity
how is it that no one has ever solved the mystery
because no one has ever united the essential elements that is to say the two books and the two sentences
no one but ars√®ne lupin and myself
but father g√©lis and i knew all about those things and likewise
holmes smiled and said monsieur devanne everybody can not solve riddles
i have been trying for ten years to accomplish what you did in ten minutes
they emerged from the chapel and found an automobile
ah there s an auto waiting for us
you said your chauffeur hadn t returned
they approached the machine and mon
devanne questioned the chauffer edouard who gave you orders to come here
near the railway station and he told me to come to the chapel
what for to wait for you monsieur and your friend
devanne and holmes exchanged looks and mon
devanne said he knew the mystery would be a simple one for you
a smile of satisfaction lighted up the detective s serious features for a moment
he shook his head as he said a clever man
i met him a short time ago on my way from the station
and you knew it was horace velmont i mean ars√®ne lupin
i wonder how it came no but i supposed it was from a certain ironical speech he made
and yet i had everything on my side such as five gendarmes who passed us
you should have taken advantage of the opportunity
really monsieur said the englishman haughtily when i encounter an adversary like ars√®ne lupin i do not take advantage of chance opportunities i create them
but time pressed and since lupin had been so kind as to send the automobile they resolved to profit by it
they seated themselves in the comfortable limousine edouard took his place at the wheel and away they went toward the railway station
suddenly devanne s eyes fell upon a small package in one of the pockets of the carriage
yes it is addressed sherlock holmes from ars√®ne lupin
the englishman took the package opened it and found that it contained a watch
ah he exclaimed with an angry gesture
ars√®ne lupin returns your watch
but in order to return it he must have taken it
sherlock holmes watch stolen by ars√®ne lupin
he roared with laughter unable to control himself
after which he said in a tone of earnest conviction a clever man indeed
the englishman never moved a muscle
on the way to dieppe he never spoke a word but fixed his gaze on the flying landscape
his silence was terrible unfathomable more violent than the wildest rage
at the railway station he spoke calmly but in a voice that impressed one with the vast energy and will power of that famous man
he said yes he is a clever man but some day i shall have the pleasure of placing on his shoulder the hand i now offer to you monsieur devanne
and i believe that ars√®ne lupin and sherlock holmes will meet again some day
yes the world is too small we will meet we must meet and then the further startling and thrilling adventures of ars√®ne lupin will be found in the book entitled ars√®ne lupin versus herlock sholmes

the rays of the september sun flooded the great halls of the old ch√¢teau of the dukes of charmerace lighting up with their mellow glow the spoils of so many ages and many lands jumbled together with the execrable taste which so often afflicts those whose only standard of value is money
the golden light warmed the panelled walls and old furniture to a dull lustre and gave back to the fading gilt of the first empire chairs and couches something of its old brightness
it illumined the long line of pictures on the walls pictures of dead and gone charmeraces the stern or debonair faces of the men soldiers statesmen dandies the gentle or imperious faces of beautiful women
it flashed back from armour of brightly polished steel and drew dull gleams from armour of bronze
the hues of rare porcelain of the rich inlays of oriental or renaissance cabinets mingled with the hues of the pictures the tapestry the persian rugs about the polished floor to fill the hall with a rich glow of colour
but of all the beautiful and precious things which the warmed to a clearer beauty the face of the girl who sat writing at a table in front of the long windows which opened on to the turf of the broad terrace was the most beautiful and the most precious
it was a delicate almost frail beauty
her skin was clear with the transparent lustre of old porcelain and her pale cheeks were only tinted with the pink of the faintest roses
her straight nose was delicately cut her rounded chin admirably moulded
a lover of beauty would have been at a loss whether more to admire her clear germander eyes so melting and so adorable or the sensitive mouth with its rather full lips inviting all the kisses
but assuredly he would have been grieved by the perpetual air of sadness which rested on the beautiful wistful melancholy of the slav deepened by something of personal misfortune and suffering
her face was framed by a mass of soft fair hair shot with strands of gold where the sunlight fell on it and little curls rebellious to the comb strayed over her white forehead tiny feathers of gold
she was addressing envelopes and a long list of names lay on her left hand
when she had addressed an envelope she slipped into it a
on each was printed m has the honour to inform you of the marriage of his daughter germaine to the duke of charmerace
she wrote steadily on adding envelope after envelope to the pile ready for the post which rose in front of her
but now and again when the flushed and laughing girls who were playing on the terrace raised their voices higher than usual as they called the score and distracted her attention from her work her gaze strayed through the open window and lingered on them wistfully and as her eyes came back to her task she sighed with so faint a wistfulness that she hardly knew she sighed
then a voice from the terrace cried sonia
germaine answered the writing girl
tea order tea will you cried the voice a petulant voice rather harsh to the ear
germaine said sonia and having finished addressing the envelope under her pen she laid it on the pile ready to be posted and crossing the room to the old wide fireplace she rang the bell
she stood by the fireplace a moment restoring to its place a rose which had fallen from a vase on the mantelpiece and her attitude as with arms upraised she arranged the flowers displayed the delightful line of a slender figure
as she let fall her arms to her side a footman entered the room
will you please bring the tea alfred she said in a charming voice of that pure tone which has been nature s most precious gift to but a few of the greatest actresses
he went in the car to rennes to lunch and it s a good many miles away
he won t be back for another hour
and the s not back from his ride yet is he
not yet miss said alfred turning to go
have all of you got your things packed for the journey to paris
you will have to start soon you know
well all the men are ready i know miss
but about the maids miss i can t say
they ve been bustling about all day but it takes them longer than it does us
tell them to hurry up and be as quick as you can with the tea please said sonia
alfred went out of the room sonia went back to the
she did not take up her pen she took up one of the and her lips moved slowly as she read it in a pondering depression
the petulant imperious voice broke in upon her musing
aren t you getting on with those letters
it cried angrily and germaine came through the long window into the hall
the heiress to the millions carried her tennis racquet in her hand and her rosy cheeks were flushed redder than ever by the game
she was a pretty girl in a striking rather obvious very foil to sonia s delicate beauty
her lips were a little too thin her eyes too shallow and together they gave her a rather hard air in strongest contrast to the gentle sympathetic face of sonia
the two friends with whom germaine had been playing tennis followed her into the hall jeanne gautier tall sallow dark with a somewhat malicious air marie bullier short round commonplace and sentimental
they came to the table at which sonia was at work and pointing to the pile of envelopes marie said are these all
yes and we ve only got to the letter v said germaine frowning at sonia
you ve invited the whole faubourg said marie shuffling the pile of envelopes with an envious air
you ll know very few people at your wedding said jeanne with a spiteful little giggle
i beg your pardon my dear said germaine boastfully
madame de relzi√®res my fiance s cousin gave an at home the other day in my honour
at it she introduced half paris to paris i m destined to know the paris you ll see in my
but we shall no longer be fit friends for you when you re the duchess of charmerace said jeanne
why said germaine and then she added quickly above everything sonia don t forget veaul√©glise  university university street
university street said sonia taking a fresh envelope and beginning to address it
i m wondering whether veaul√©glise ought to have a cross a double cross or a triple cross said germaine with an air of extreme importance
what s that cried marie and jeanne together
a single cross means an invitation to the church a double cross an invitation to the marriage and the and the triple cross means an invitation to the marriage the breakfast and the signing of the
what do you think the duchess of veaul√©glise ought to have don t ask me
i haven t the honour of knowing that great lady cried jeanne
but i have here the of the late duchess of charmerace jacques mother
the two duchesses were on excellent terms
besides the duchess of veaul√©glise is rather but greatly admired for her piety
she goes to early service three times a week
then put three crosses said jeanne
in your place my dear i shouldn t risk a slip
i should ask my fiance s advice
he doesn t care a rap about this kind of thing
he has changed so in the last seven years
seven years ago he took nothing seriously
why he set off on an expedition to the south to show off
oh in those days he was truly a duke
he s as sober as a judge said germaine
he s as gay as a lark said sonia in sudden protest
germaine pouted at her and said oh he s gay enough when he s making fun of people
but apart from that he s as sober as a judge
your father must be delighted with the change said jeanne
why he s lunching at rennes with the minister with the sole object of getting jacques decorated
well the legion of honour is a fine thing to have said marie
the legion of honour is all very well for people but it s quite out of place for a duke cried germaine
alfred came in bearing the and set it on a little table near that at which sonia was sitting
germaine who was feeling too important to sit still was walking up and down the room
suddenly she stopped short and pointing to a silver statuette which stood on the piano she said what s this
why when we came in it was on the cabinet in its usual place said sonia in some astonishment
did you come into the hall while we were out in the garden alfred said germaine to the footman
but some one must have come into it germaine persisted
statuettes don t move about of themselves
all of them stared at the statuette as if they expected it to move again forthwith under their very eyes
then alfred put it back in its usual place on one of the cabinets and went out of the room
sonia poured out the tea and over it they babbled about the coming marriage the frocks they would wear at it and the presents germaine had already received
that reminded her to ask sonia if any one had yet telephoned from her father s house in paris and sonia said that no one had
that s very annoying said germaine
it shows that nobody has sent me a present
pouting she shrugged her shoulders with an air of a spoiled child which sat but poorly on a young woman of
the shops don t deliver things on sunday said sonia gently
but germaine still pouted like a spoiled child
isn t your beautiful duke coming to have tea with us said jeanne a little anxiously
oh yes i m expecting him at four
he had to go for a ride with the two du buits
they re coming to tea here too said germaine
gone for a ride with the two du buits
my brother went to the du buits house after lunch to see andre and georges
they went for a drive this morning and won t be back till late
well why did the duke tell me so said germaine knitting her brow with a puzzled air
if i were you i should inquire into this thoroughly
we know what dukes will be just as well to keep an eye on him said jeanne maliciously
germaine flushed quickly and her eyes flashed
i have every confidence in jacques
i am absolutely sure of him she said angrily
oh you re sure it s all right said jeanne
the ringing of the made a fortunate diversion
germaine rushed to it clapped the receiver to her ear and cried hello is that you pierre
ah some presents have come have they
oh from the countess rudolph and the baron de valery
her voice rose high thrilling with pride
then she turned her face to her friends with the receiver still at her ear and cried oh girls a pearl necklace too
who sent it said germaine turning to the telephone again
oh a friend of papa s she added in a tone of disappointment
never mind after all it s a pearl necklace
you ll be sure and lock the doors carefully victoire won t you
and lock up the necklace in the secret cupboard
she hung up the receiver and came away from the telephone frowning
papa s friends and relations give me marvellous presents and all the swells send me
he s above all this kind of thing
the faubourg hardly knows that we re engaged
he doesn t go about advertising it said jeanne smiling
you re joking but all the same what you say is true said germaine
that s exactly what his cousin madame de relzi√®res said to me the other day at the at home she gave in my t it sonia
and she walked to the window and turning her back on them stared out of it
she has got her mouth full of that at home said jeanne to marie in a low voice
marie broke it speaking of madame de relzi√®res do you know that she is on pins and needles with anxiety
her son is fighting a duel she said
she got hold of a letter from the seconds said marie
my mind is quite at rest about relzi√®res said germaine
sonia did not seem to share her freedom from anxiety
her forehead was puckered in little lines of perplexity as if she were puzzling out some problem and there was a look of something very like fear in her gentle eyes
wasn t relzi√®res a great friend of your fiance at one time said jeanne
i should think he was said germaine
why it was through relzi√®res that we got to know jacques
this very ch√¢teau said germaine
actually in his own house said marie in some surprise
if a few months after his father s death jacques had not found himself and obliged to dispose of this ch√¢teau to raise the money for his expedition to the south pole and if papa and i had not wanted an historic ch√¢teau and lastly if papa had not suffered from rheumatism i should not be calling myself in a month from now the duchess of charmerace
now what on earth has your father s rheumatism got to do with your being duchess of charmerace cried jeanne
papa was afraid that this ch√¢teau was damp
to prove to papa that he had nothing to fear jacques en grand seigneur offered him his hospitality here at charmerace for three weeks
that was truly ducal said marie
but he is always like that said sonia
oh he s all right in that way little as he cares about society said germaine
well by a miracle my father got cured of his rheumatism here
jacques fell in love with me papa made up his mind to buy the ch√¢teau and i demanded the hand of jacques in marriage
but you were only sixteen then said marie with some surprise
yes but even at sixteen a girl ought to know that a duke is a duke
then since jacques was setting out for the south pole and papa considered me much too young to get married i promised jacques to wait for his return
why it was everything that s romantic
oh yes said germaine and she pouted
but between ourselves if i d known that he was going to stay all that time at the south that s true broke in marie
to go away for three years and stay away the end of the world
all germaine s beautiful youth said jeanne with her malicious smile
it s the flower of one s age said jeanne
not quite said germaine hastily
and look at the wretched luck i ve had
the duke falls ill and is treated at montevideo
as soon as he recovers since he s the most obstinate person in the world he resolves to go on with the expedition
he sets out and for an age without a word of warning there s no more news of news of any kind
for six months you know we believed him dead
oh how unhappy you must have been said sonia
for six months i daren t put on a light frock said germaine turning to her
a lot she must have cared for him whispered jeanne to marie
fortunately one fine day the letters began again
three months ago a telegram informed us that he was coming back and at last the duke returned said germaine with a theatrical air
the duke returned cried jeanne mimicking her
fancy waiting nearly seven years for one s fiance
oh you re a sentimentalist mlle
kritchnoff said jeanne in a tone of mockery
it was the influence of the castle
oh to own the castle of charmerace and call oneself mlle
one must become a duchess said jeanne
yes yes and for all this wonderful constancy seven years of it germaine was on the point of becoming engaged to another man said marie smiling
and he a mere baron said jeanne laughing
she nearly became engaged to the duke s cousin the baron de relzi√®res
oh it s all very well to laugh at me but being the cousin and heir of the duke relzi√®res would have assumed the title and i should have been duchess just the same said germaine triumphantly
evidently that was all that mattered said jeanne
we ve promised to run in to see the comtesse de grosjean
you know the comtesse de grosjean
she spoke with an air of careless pride and rose to go
papa used to know her husband on the stock exchange when he was still called simply grosjean
for his part papa preferred to keep his name intact said germaine with quiet pride
that s one way of looking at it
well then i ll see you in paris
you still intend to start said jeanne
jeanne and marie slipped on their to the accompaniment of chattering and kissing and went out of the room
as she closed the door on them germaine turned to sonia and said i do hate those two girls
why you idiot they re just bursting with envy of said germaine
well they ve every reason to be she added confidently surveying herself in a venetian mirror with a petted child s
the coming of the charolais sonia went back to her table and once more began putting in their envelopes and addressing them
germaine moved restlessly about the room fidgeting with the on the cabinets shifting the pieces about interrupting sonia to ask whether she preferred this arrangement or that throwing herself into a chair to read a magazine getting up in a couple of minutes to straighten a picture on the wall throwing out all the while idle questions not worth answering
human beings would have been irritated to exasperation by her fidgeting sonia endured it with a perfect patience
five times germaine asked her whether she should wear her heliotrope or her pink gown at a forthcoming dinner at madame de relzi√®res
five times sonia said without the slightest variation in her tone i think you look better in the pink
and all the while the pile of addressed envelopes rose steadily
presently the door opened and alfred stood on the threshold
two gentlemen have called to see you miss he said
ah the two du buits cried germaine
they didn t give their names miss
a gentleman in the prime of life and a younger one said germaine
and have you any orders for me to give victoire when we get to paris said alfred
we re all going by the seven o clock train
it s a long way from here to paris we shall only reach it at nine in the morning
that will give us just time to get the house ready for you by the time you get there evening said alfred
the cart has already taken the heavy luggage to the station
all you ll have to do is to see after your bags
show du buit and his brother in said germaine
she moved to a chair near the window and disposed herself in an attitude of studied and obviously studied grace
as she leant her head at a charming angle back against the tall back of the chair her eyes fell on the window and they opened wide
whatever s what said sonia without raising her eyes from the envelope she was addressing
one of the panes has been taken out
so it at the level of the fastening said sonia
and the two girls stared at the gap
haven t you noticed it before said germaine
no the broken glass must have fallen outside said sonia
the noise of the opening of the door drew their attention from the window
two figures were advancing towards short round tubby man of bald with bright grey eyes which seemed to be continually dancing away from meeting the eyes of any other human being
behind him came a slim young man dark and grave
for all the difference in their colouring it was clear that they were father and son their eyes were set so close together
the son seemed to have inherited along with her black eyes his mother s nose thin and aquiline the nose of the father started thin from the brow but ended in a scarlet bulb eloquent of an exhaustive acquaintance with the vintages of the world
germaine rose looking at them with an air of some surprise and uncertainty these were not her friends the du buits
the elder man advancing with a smiling bonhomie bowed and said in an adenoid voice ingratiating of tone i m charolais young of the legion of at rennes
we came from rennes this morning and we lunched at kerlor s farm
shall i order tea for them whispered sonia
gracious no said germaine sharply under her breath then louder she said to charolais and what is your object in calling
we asked to see your father said charolais smiling with broad amiability while his eyes danced across her face avoiding any meeting with hers
the footman told us that was out but that his daughter was at home
and we were unable quite unable to deny ourselves the pleasure of meeting you
with that he sat down and his son followed his example
sonia and germaine taken aback looked at one another in some perplexity
what a fine ch√¢teau papa said the young man
yes my boy it s a very fine ch√¢teau said charolais looking round the hall with appreciative but greedy eyes
it s a very fine ch√¢teau young ladies said charolais
yes but excuse me what is it you have called about said germaine
charolais crossed his legs leant back in his chair thrust his thumbs into the of his waistcoat and said well we ve come about the advertisement we saw in the rennes advertiser that wanted to get rid of a and my son is always saying to me i should like a which rushes the hills papa
we ve got a sixty but it s not for sale
my father is even using it himself said germaine
perhaps it s the car we saw in the said charolais
but if your son really loves rushing hills as you say we have a hundred car which my father wants to get rid of
wait where s the photograph of it sonia
the two girls rose went to a table set against the wall beyond the window and began turning over the papers with which it was loaded in the search for the photograph
they had barely turned their backs when the hand of young charolais shot out as swiftly as the tongue of a lizard catching a fly closed round the silver statuette on the top of the cabinet beside him and flashed it into his jacket pocket
charolais was watching the two girls one would have said that he had eyes for nothing else yet without moving a muscle of his face set in its perpetual beaming smile he hissed in an angry whisper drop it you idiot
the young man scowled askance at him
the young man s arm shot out with the same quickness and the statuette stood in its place
there was just the faintest sigh of relief from charolais as germaine turned and came to him with the photograph in her hand
ah here we are he said putting on a pair of
well well this is something to talk over
what s the least you ll take for it
have nothing to do with this kind of thing cried germaine
he will be back from rennes soon
then you can settle the matter with him
charolais rose and said very good
we will go now and come back presently
i m sorry to have intruded on you young up your time like not at at all murmured germaine politely
said charolais and he and his son went to the door and bowed themselves out
what creatures said germaine going to the window as the door closed behind the two visitors
all the same if they do buy the hundred papa will be awfully pleased
it s odd too that jacques hasn t come back yet
he told me that he would be here between four and five
and the du buits have not come either said sonia
the du buits have not come either
what on earth are you wasting your time for
she added sharply raising her voice
just finish addressing those letters while you re waiting
they re nearly finished said sonia
sonia went back to the just the slightest deepening of the faint pink roses in her cheeks marked her sense of germaine s rudeness
after three years as companion to germaine she was well inured to millionaire manners they had almost lost the power to move her
germaine dropped into a chair for twenty seconds then flung out of it
it s the first time i ve ever known him late
she went to the window and looked across the wide stretch of and woodland on which the ch√¢teau set on the very crown of the ridge looked down
the road running with the irritating straightness of so many of the roads of france was visible for a full three miles
perhaps the duke went to the ch√¢teau de relzi√®res to see his i fancy that at bottom the duke does not care very much for the baron de relzi√®res
they always look as though they detested one another said sonia without raising her eyes from the letter she was addressing
you ve noticed that have you said germaine
now as far as jacques is s so indifferent
none the less when we were at the relzi√®res on thursday i caught him quarrelling with paul de relzi√®res
quarrelling said sonia sharply with a sudden uneasiness in air and eyes and voice
and they said to one another in the oddest way
but surely they shook hands said sonia
they bowed as if each of them had swallowed a poker
said sonia starting up with a frightened air and her voice stuck in her throat
then what said germaine a little startled by her face
monsieur de relzi√®res duel cried sonia
you don t think it was with jacques
i don t this duke s manner this du buits said sonia
suppose something happened to him
suppose the it s me the duke s fighting about cried germaine proudly with a little skipping jump of triumphant joy
sonia stared through her without seeing her
her face was a dead had chilled the lustre from her skin her breath panted through her parted lips and her dilated eyes seemed to look on some dreadful picture
germaine pirouetted about the hall at the very height of triumph
to have a duke fighting a duel about her was far beyond the wildest dreams of snobbishness
she chuckled again and again and once she clapped her hands and laughed aloud
he s fighting a swordsman of the first invincible said so yourself sonia muttered in a tone of anguish
she pressed her hands to her eyes as if to shut out a hideous vision
germaine did not hear her she was staring at herself in a mirror and bridling to her own image
sonia tottered to the window and stared down at the road along which must come the tidings of weal or irremediable woe
she kept passing her hand over her eyes as if to clear their vision
suddenly she started and bent forward rigid all her being concentrated in the effort to see
then she cried mademoiselle germaine
what is it said germaine coming to her side
there said sonia waving a hand towards the road
yes and isn t he galloping said germaine
do you think so said germaine doubtfully
well he gets here just in time for tea said germaine in a tone of extreme satisfaction
he knows that i hate to be kept waiting
he said to me i shall be back by five at the latest
he has to go all the way round the park
there s no direct road the brook is between us
all the same he s coming in a straight line said germaine
the horseman had left the road and was galloping across the meadows straight for the brook
in twenty seconds he reached its treacherous bank and as he set his horse at it sonia covered her eyes
my father gave three hundred guineas for that horse
chapter iii lupin s way sonia in a sudden revulsion of feeling in a reaction from her fears slipped back and sat down at the panting quickly struggling to keep back the tears of relief
she did not see the duke gallop up the slope dismount and hand over his horse to the groom who came running to him
there was still a mist in her eyes to blur his figure as he came through the window
if it s for me plenty of tea very little cream and three lumps of sugar he cried in a gay ringing voice and pulled out his watch
and he bent down took germaine s hand and kissed it with an air of gallant devotion
if he had indeed just fought a duel there were no signs of it in his bearing
his air his voice were entirely careless
he was a man whose whole thought at the moment was fixed on his tea and his punctuality
he drew a chair near the for germaine sat down himself and sonia handed him a cup of tea with so shaky a hand that the spoon clinked in the saucer
you ve been fighting a duel said germaine
you ve heard already said the duke in some surprise
you re not wounded your grace said sonia anxiously
not a scratch said the duke smiling at her
will you be so good as to get on with those sonia said germaine sharply and sonia went back to the
turning to the duke germaine said did you fight on my account
would you be pleased to know that i had fought on your account said the duke and there was a faint mocking light in his eyes far too faint for the germaine to perceive
you ve been fighting about some woman said germaine petulantly
if i had been fighting about a woman it could only be you said the duke
it could hardly be about sonia or my maid said germaine
but what was the reason of the duel
oh the reason of it was entirely childish said the duke
i was in a bad temper and de relzi√®res said something that annoyed me
then it wasn t about me and if it wasn t about me it wasn t really worth while fighting said germaine in a tone of acute disappointment
the mocking light deepened a little in the duke s eyes
but if i had been killed everybody would have said the duke of charmerace has been killed in a duel about mademoiselle
that would have sounded very fine indeed said the duke and a touch of mockery had crept into his voice
now don t begin trying to annoy me again said germaine pettishly
the last thing i should dream of my dear girl said the duke smiling
poor dear de relzi√®res he won t be out of bed for the next six months said the duke and he laughed lightly and gaily
it will do poor dear de relzi√®res a world of good
he has a touch of enteritis and for enteritis there is nothing like rest said the duke
sonia was not getting on very quickly with the
germaine was sitting with her back to her and over her shoulder sonia could watch the face of the extraordinarily mobile face changing with every passing mood
sometimes his eyes met hers and hers fell before them
but as soon as they turned away from her she was watching him again almost greedily as if she could not see enough of his face in which strength of will and purpose was mingled with a faint ironic scepticism and tempered by a fine air of race
he finished his tea then he took a morocco case from his pocket and said to germaine it must be quite three days since i gave you anything
he opened the case disclosed a pearl pendant and handed it to her
she took it from the case saying that it was a beauty
she showed it to sonia then she put it on and stood before a mirror admiring the effect
to tell the truth the effect was not entirely desirable
the pearls did not improve the look of her rather coarse brown skin and her skin added nothing to the beauty of the pearls
sonia saw this and so did the duke
he looked at sonia s white throat
she knew that the same thought was in both their minds the pearls would have looked infinitely better there
germaine finished admiring herself she was incapable even of suspecting that so expensive a pendant could not suit her perfectly
are all those invitations to the wedding
that s only down to the letter v said germaine proudly
and there are letters in the alphabet
you must be inviting the whole world
you ll have to have the madeleine enlarged
there isn t a church in paris that will said the duke
won t it be a splendid marriage said germaine
there ll be something like a crush
if i were you i should have careful arrangements made said the duke
oh let people look after themselves
they ll remember it better if they re crushed a little said germaine
there was a flicker of contemptuous wonder in the duke s eyes
but he only shrugged his shoulders and turning to sonia said will you be an angel and play me a little grieg mademoiselle kritchnoff
excuse me jacques but mademoiselle kritchnoff has her work to do said germaine tartly
five minutes a morsel of grieg i beg said the duke with an irresistible smile
all right said germaine grudgingly
but i ve something important to talk to you about
i ve the last photograph i took of you and mademoiselle sonia
germaine frowned and shrugged her shoulders
with your light frocks in the open air you look like two big flowers said the duke
it s very all trifles said the duke smiling
and he took a photograph from his pocket and held it out to her
we re making the most appalling faces said germaine looking at the photograph in his hand
well perhaps you are making faces said the duke seriously considering the photograph with grave earnestness
but they re not appalling by any means
you shall be judge mademoiselle sonia
the we won t talk about the the outlines
look at the movement of your scarf
and he handed the photograph to sonia
jacques said germaine impatiently
oh yes you ve something important to tell me
what is it said the duke with an air of resignation and he took the photograph from sonia and put it carefully back in his pocket
victoire has telephoned from paris to say that we ve had a and a louis seize inkstand given us said germaine
hurrah cried the duke in a sudden shout that made them both jump
and a pearl necklace said germaine
you re perfectly childish said germaine pettishly
i tell you we ve been given a and you shout hurrah
i say we ve been given a pearl necklace and you shout hurrah
you can t have the slightest sense of values
this pearl necklace is from one of your father s friends isn t it said the duke
but the inkstand and the must be from the faubourg and well on the shabby side said the duke
well then my dear girl what are you complaining about
they balance the equilibrium is restored
you can t have everything said the duke and he laughed mischievously
germaine flushed and bit her lip her eyes sparkled
you don t care a rap about me she said stormily
but i find you adorable said the duke
you keep annoying me said germaine pettishly
i shall end by taking a dislike to know i shall
wait till we re married for that my dear girl said the duke and he laughed again with a blithe boyish cheerfulness which deepened the angry flush in germaine s cheeks
can t you be serious about anything
i am the most serious man in europe said the duke
germaine went to the window and stared out of it sulkily
the duke walked up and down the hall looking at the pictures of some of his grotesque humorous appreciation
between addressing the envelopes sonia kept glancing at him
once he caught her eye and smiled at her
germaine s back was eloquent of her displeasure
the duke stopped at a gap in the line of pictures in which there hung a strip of old tapestry
i can never understand why you have left all these ancestors of mine staring from the walls and have taken away the quite admirable and interesting portrait of myself he said carelessly
germaine turned sharply from the window sonia stopped in the middle of addressing an envelope and both the girls stared at him in astonishment
there certainly was a portrait of me where that tapestry hangs
what have you done with it said the duke
you re making fun of us again said germaine
surely your grace knows what happened said sonia
we wrote all the details to you and sent you all the papers three years ago
didn t you get them said germaine
three years ago i was in the neighbourhood of the south pole and lost at that said the duke
but it was most dramatic my dear jacques
all paris was talking of it said germaine
germaine crossed the hall quickly to the gap in the line of pictures
she drew aside the piece of tapestry and in the middle of the panel over which the portrait of the duke had hung he saw written in chalk the words ars√®ne lupin what do you think of that autograph said germaine
ars√®ne lupin said the duke in a tone of some bewilderment
it seems that he always does so said sonia in an explanatory tone
surely you know who ars√®ne lupin is said germaine impatiently
i haven t the slightest notion said the duke
the most whimsical the most audacious and the most genial thief in france
for the last ten years he has kept the police at bay
he has baffled ganimard holmlock shears the great english detective and even guerchard whom everybody says is the greatest detective we ve had in france since vidocq
in fact he s our national robber
do you mean to say you don t know him
not even enough to ask him to lunch at a restaurant said the duke flippantly
he has dined two evenings running at the english embassy
but if nobody knows him how did they learn that said the duke with a puzzled air
because the second evening about ten o clock they noticed that one of the guests had disappeared and with him all the jewels of the ambassadress
yes and lupin left his card behind him with these words scribbled on it this is not a robbery it is a restitution
you took the wallace collection from us
but it was a hoax wasn t it said the duke
no your grace and he has done better than that
you remember the affair of the daray savings bank for poor people said sonia her gentle face glowing with a sudden enthusiastic animation
wasn t that the financier who doubled his fortune at the expense of a heap of poor wretches and ruined two thousand people
and lupin stripped daray s house and took from him everything he had in his
he didn t leave him a sou of the money
and then when he d taken it from him he distributed it among all the poor wretches whom daray had ruined
but this isn t a thief you re talking s a philanthropist said the duke
a fine sort of philanthropist broke in germaine in a peevish tone
there was a lot of philanthropy about his robbing papa wasn t there
well said the duke with an air of profound reflection if you come to think of it that robbery was not worthy of this national hero
my portrait if you except the charm and beauty of the face itself is not worth much
if you think he was satisfied with your portrait you re very much mistaken
all my father s collections were robbed said germaine
your father s collections said the duke
but they re better guarded than the bank of france
your father is as careful of them as the apple of his eye
that s exactly was too careful of them
this is very interesting said the duke and he sat down on a couch before the gap in the pictures to go into the matter more at his ease
i suppose he had accomplices in the house itself
yes one accomplice said germaine
what on earth do you mean said the duke
you re getting quite incomprehensible my dear girl
one morning papa received a wait
sonia get me the lupin papers out of the bureau
sonia rose from the and went to a bureau an admirable example of the work of the great english maker chippendale
it stood on the other side of the hall between an oriental cabinet and a italian all the world as if it were standing in a crowded curiosity the natural effect that the three pieces by their mere incongruity took something each from the beauty of the other
sonia raised the flap of the bureau and taking from one of the drawers a small portfolio turned over the papers in it and handed a letter to the duke
it s addressed to collector at the ch√¢teau de charmerace
the duke opened the envelope and took out a letter
it s an odd handwriting he said
the letters of it were small but perfectly formed
it looked the handwriting of a man who knew exactly what he wanted to say and liked to say it with extreme precision
the letter ran dear sir please forgive my writing to you without our having been introduced to one another but i flatter myself that you know me at any rate by name
there is in the next your hall a gainsborough of admirable quality which affords me infinite pleasure
your goyas in the same are also to my liking as well as your van dyck
in the further i note the renaissance marvellous flemish tapestry the fragonard the clock signed boulle and various other objects of less importance
but above all i have set my heart on that coronet which you bought at the sale of the marquise de ferronaye and which was formerly worn by the unfortunate princesse de lamballe
i take the greatest interest in this coronet in the first place on account of the charming and tragic memories which it calls up in the mind of a poet passionately fond of history and in the second it is hardly worth while talking about that kind of account of its intrinsic value
i reckon indeed that the stones in your coronet are at the very lowest worth half a million francs
i beg you my dear sir to have these different objects properly packed up and to forward them addressed to me carriage paid to the batignolles station
failing this i shall proceed to remove them myself on the night of thursday august th
please pardon the slight trouble to which i am putting you and believe me yours very sincerely ars√®ne lupin
occurs to me that the pictures have not glass before them
it would be as well to repair this omission before forwarding them to me and i am sure that you will take this extra trouble cheerfully
i am aware of course that some of the best judges declare that a picture loses some of its quality when seen through glass
but it preserves them and we should always be ready and willing to sacrifice a portion of our own pleasure for the benefit of posterity
the duke laughed and said really this is extraordinarily funny
it must have made your father laugh
he took it seriously enough i can tell you
not to the point of forwarding the things to batignolles i hope said the duke
no but to the point of being driven wild said germaine
and since the police had always been baffled by lupin he had the brilliant idea of trying what soldiers could do
the commandant at rennes is a great friend of papa s and papa went to him and told him about lupin s letter and what he feared
the colonel laughed at him but he offered him a corporal and six soldiers to guard his collection on the night of the seventh
it was arranged that they should come from rennes by the last train so that the burglars should have no warning of their coming
well they came seven picked who had seen service in tonquin
we gave them supper and then the corporal posted them in the hall and the two where the pictures and things were
at eleven we all went to bed after promising the corporal that in the event of any fight with the burglars we would not stir from our rooms
i can tell you i felt awfully nervous
i couldn t get to sleep for ages and ages
then when i did i did not wake till morning
the night had passed absolutely quietly
nothing out of the common had happened
there had not been the slightest noise
we dressed as quickly as we could and rushed down to the
pictures had gone tapestries had gone cabinets had gone and the clock had gone
and the coronet too said the duke
and it was doubtless to make up for not getting it that lupin stole your portrait
at any rate he didn t say that he was going to steal it in his letter
had he hypnotized the corporal and the six soldiers
or had he murdered them all said the duke
there wasn t any corporal and there weren t any soldiers
the corporal was lupin and the soldiers were part of his gang said germaine
i don t understand said the duke
the colonel promised your father a corporal and six men
they came to the railway station all right said germaine
but you know the little inn between the railway station and the ch√¢teau
they stopped to drink there and at eleven o clock next morning one of the villagers found all seven of them along with the footman who was guiding them to the ch√¢teau sleeping like logs in the little wood half a mile from the inn
of course the innkeeper could not explain when their wine was drugged
he could only tell us that a motorist who had stopped at the inn to get some supper had called the soldiers in and insisted on standing them drinks
they had seemed a little fuddled before they left the inn and the motorist had insisted on driving them to the ch√¢teau in his car
when the drug took effect he simply carried them out of it one by one and laid them in the wood to sleep it off
lupin seems to have made a thorough job of it anyhow said the duke
i should think so said germaine
guerchard was sent down from paris but he could not find a single clue
it was not for want of trying for he hates lupin
it s a regular fight between them and so far lupin has scored every point
he must be as clever as they make em said the duke
and do you know i shouldn t be at all surprised if he s in the neighbourhood now
some one has been changing the place of things
that silver statuette was on the cabinet and we found it moved to the piano
some one has broken a pane in it just at the height of the fastening
the deuce they have said the duke
chapter iv the duke intervenes the duke rose came to the window and looked at the broken pane
he stepped out on to the terrace and looked at the turf then he came back into the room
that pane has not been broken at all
if it had been broken the pieces of glass would be lying on the turf
we must warn your father to look to his treasures
i said that ars√®ne lupin was in the neighbourhood
ars√®ne lupin is a very capable man said the duke smiling
but there s no reason to suppose that he s the only burglar in france or even in
i m sure that he s in the neighbourhood
i have a feeling that he is said germaine stubbornly
the duke shrugged his shoulders and said a smile far be it from me to contradict you
a woman s intuition is it s always a woman s intuition
he came back into the hall and as he did so the door opened and a man in the dress of a gamekeeper stood on the threshold
there are visitors to see you mademoiselle germaine he said in a very deep bass voice
are you answering the door firmin said germaine
yes mademoiselle germaine there s only me to do it
all the servants have started for the station and my wife and i are going to see after the family and morning
shall i show these gentlemen in
two gentlemen who say they have an appointment
what are their names said germaine
i don t know what their names are
that s an advantage to any one who answers doors said the duke smiling at the stolid firmin
well it can t be the two charolais again
it s not time for them to come back
i told them papa would not be back yet said germaine
no it can t be them mademoiselle germaine said firmin with decision
very well show them in she said
firmin went out leaving the door open behind him and they heard his boots clatter and squeak on the stone floor of the outer hall
a little while ago alfred announced two gentlemen
i thought they were georges and andre du buit for they promised to come to tea
i told alfred to show them in and to my surprise there appeared two horrible provincials
she stopped short for there coming through the door were the two charolais father and son
charolais pressed his to his bosom and bowed low
once more i salute you mademoiselle he said
his son bowed and revealed behind him another young man
he has a chemist s shop said charolais waving a large red hand at the young man
the young man also blessed with the family eyes set close together entered the hall and bowed to the two girls
the duke raised his eyebrows ever so slightly
i m very sorry gentlemen said germaine but my father has not yet returned
there is not the slightest need said charolais and he and his two sons settled themselves down on three chairs with the air of people who had come to make a considerable stay
for a moment germaine taken aback by their coolness was speechless then she said hastily very likely he won t be back for another hour
i shouldn t like you to waste your time
oh it doesn t matter said charolais with an indulgent air and turning to the duke he added however while we re waiting if you re a member of the family sir we might perhaps discuss the least you will take for the
i m sorry said the duke but i have nothing to do with it
before charolais could reply the door opened and firmin s deep voice said will you please come in here sir
a third young man came into the hall
what you here bernard said charolais
i told you to wait at the park gates
i wanted to see the car too said bernard
he is destined for the bar said charolais with a great air of paternal pride
but how many are there said germaine faintly
before charolais could answer firmin once more appeared on the threshold
the master s just come back miss he said
said germaine and turning to charolais she added if you will come with me gentlemen i will take you to my father and you can discuss the price of the car at once
as she spoke she moved towards the door
charolais and his sons rose and made way for her
the father and the two eldest sons made haste to follow her out of the room
but bernard lingered behind apparently to admire the on the cabinets
with infinite quickness he grabbed two objects off the nearest and followed his brothers
the duke sprang across the hall in three strides caught him by the arm on the very threshold jerked him back into the hall and shut the door
no you don t my young friend he said sharply
don t what said bernard trying to shake off his grip
no no i haven of the kind stammered bernard
the duke grasped the young man s left wrist plunged his hand into the which he was carrying drew out of it a silver and held it before his eyes
bernard turned pale to the lips
his frightened eyes seemed about to leap from their sockets
the duke shifted his grip to his collar and thrust his hand into the of his coat
bernard helpless in his grip and utterly taken aback by his quickness made no resistance
the duke drew out a morocco case and said is this a mistake too heavens
the pendant cried sonia who was watching the scene with parted lips and amazed eyes
bernard dropped on his knees and clasped his hands
for god s sake don t tell any one
and the tears came streaming from his eyes
you young rogue said the duke quietly
the duke hesitated and looked down on him frowning and pulling at his moustache
then more quickly than one would have expected from so careless a trifler his mind was made up
just for this once be off with you
and he jerked him to his feet and almost threw him into the outer hall
the duke shut the door and looked at sonia breathing quickly
did you ever see anything like that
that young fellow will go a long way
and this pendant too it would have been a pity to lose it
upon my word i ought to have handed him over to the police
you did quite right to let him right
the duke set the pendant on the ledge of the bureau and came down the hall to sonia
it has upset me that unfortunate boy said sonia and her eyes were swimming with tears
do you pity the young rogue said the duke
his eyes were so terrified and so boyish
and to be caught like that stealing in the act
come come how sensitive you are said the duke in a soothing almost caressing tone
his eyes resting on her charming troubled face were glowing with a warm admiration
yes it s silly said sonia but you noticed his hunted look in them
oh i said at bottom because you look sarcastic and at first sight you re so cold
but often that s only the mask of those who have suffered the most
they are the most indulgent said sonia slowly hesitating picking her words
yes i suppose they are said the duke thoughtfully
it s because when one has suffered one understands
the duke s eyes still rested on her face
the admiration in them was mingled with compassion
you re very unhappy here aren t you
your smile is so sad and your eyes so timid said the duke slowly
you re just like a little child one longs to protect
are you quite alone in the world
his eyes and tones were full of pity and a faint flush mantled sonia s cheeks
but have you no friends said the duke
i don t mean here in france but in your own country
you see my father was a revolutionist
he died in siberia when i was a baby
i was two years old when she died
it must be hard to be alone like that said the duke
no said sonia with a faint smile i don t mind having no relations
but what is you ll laugh at heaven forbid said the duke gravely
well what is hard is never to get a letter an envelope that one opens from some one who thinks about
she paused and then added gravely but i tell myself that it s nonsense
i have a certain amount of philosophy
she smiled at adorable child s smile
a certain amount of philosophy he said softly
as they stood looking at one another with serious eyes almost with eyes that probed one another s souls the door flung open and germaine s harsh voice broke on their ears
you re getting quite impossible sonia
it s absolutely useless telling you anything
i told you particularly to pack my leather in my bag with your own hand
i happen to open a drawer and what do i see
i was oh there s no need to bother about it
i ll see after it myself said germaine
but upon my word you might be one of our guests seeing how easily you take things
come germaine a mere oversight said the duke in a coaxing tone
now excuse me jacques but you ve got an unfortunate habit of interfering in household matters
i can no longer say a word to a germaine
germaine turned from him to sonia and pointed to a packet of envelopes and some letters which bernard charolais had knocked off the table and said pick up those envelopes and letters and bring everything to my room and be quick about it
she flung out of the room and slammed the door behind her
sonia seemed entirely unmoved by the outburst no flush of mortification stained her cheeks her lips did not quiver
she stooped to pick up the fallen papers
no no let me i beg you said the duke in a tone of distress
and dropping on one knee he began to gather together the fallen papers
he set them on the table and then he said you mustn t mind what germaine says
she s always been happy and had everything she wanted
she s been spoiled don t you know
those kind of people never have any consideration for any one else
you mustn t let her outburst hurt you
he drew the envelopes and unused cards into a packet and handed them to her
that won t be too heavy for you
thank you said sonia taking it from him
shall i carry them for you said the duke
no thank you your grace said sonia
with a quick careless almost irresponsible movement he caught her hand bent down and kissed it
a great wave of rosy colour flowed over her face flooding its whiteness to her hair and throat
she stood for a moment turned to stone she put her hand to her heart
then on hasty faltering feet she went to the door opened it paused on the threshold turned and looked back at him and vanished
chapter v a letter from lupin the duke stood for a while staring thoughtfully at the door through which sonia had passed a faint smile playing round his lips
he crossed the hall to the chippendale bureau took a cigarette from a box which stood on the ledge of it beside the morocco case which held the pendant lighted it and went slowly out on to the terrace
he crossed it slowly paused for a moment on the edge of it and looked across the stretch of country with musing eyes which saw nothing of its beauty
then he turned to the right went down a flight of steps to the lower terrace crossed the lawn and took a narrow path which led into the heart of a shrubbery of tall deodoras
in the middle of it he came to one of those old stone benches and which adorn the gardens of so many french ch√¢teaux
it faced a marble basin from which rose the slender column of a pattering fountain
the figure of a cupid danced joyously on a tall pedestal to the right of the basin
the duke sat down on the bench and was still with that rare stillness which only comes of nerves in perfect harmony his brow knitted in careful thought
now and again the frown cleared from his face and his intent features relaxed into a faint smile a smile of pleasant memory
once he rose walked round the fountains frowning came back to the bench and sat down again
the early september dusk was upon him when at last he rose and with quick steps took his way through the shrubbery with the air of a man whose mind for good or ill was at last made up
when he came on to the upper terrace his eyes fell on a group which stood at the further corner near the entrance of the ch√¢teau and he sauntered slowly up to it
in the middle of it stood a big round flabby hulk of a man
he was nearly as red in the face as charolais and he looked a great deal redder owing to the extreme whiteness of the whiskers which stuck out on either side of his vast expanse of cheek
as he came up it struck the duke as rather odd that he should have the charolais eyes set close together any one who did not know that they were strangers to one another might have thought it a family likeness
the millionaire was waving his hands and roaring after the manner of a man who has cultivated the art of those with whom he does business and as the duke neared the group he caught the words
you can say yes or you can say and i don t care a hang which
it s very dear said charolais in a mournful tone
i should like to see any one else sell a hundred car for eight hundred pounds
why my good sir you re having me
no no protested charolais feebly
i tell you you re having me roared
i m letting you have a magnificent car for which i paid thirteen hundred pounds for eight hundred
it s scandalous the way you ve beaten me down
he seemed frightened out of his life by the vehemence of the big man
you wait till you ve seen how it goes said
eight hundred is very dear said charolais
you re too sharp that s what you are
but don t say any more till you ve tried the car
he turned to his chauffeur who stood by watching the struggle with an appreciative grin on his brown face and said now jean take these gentlemen to the garage and run them down to the station
he winked at jean turned again to charolais and said you know charolais you re too good a man of business for me
you re hot stuff that s what you stuff
the four charolais murmured in deep depression and went off with jean wearing something of the air of whipped dogs
when they had gone round the corner the millionaire turned to the duke and said with a chuckle he ll buy the car all him fine
no business success of yours could surprise me said the duke blandly with a faint ironical smile
s little pig s eyes danced and sparkled and the smiles flowed over the distended skin of his face like little ripples over a stagnant pool reluctantly
it seemed to be too tightly stretched for smiles
the car s four years old he said joyfully
he ll give me eight hundred for it and it s not worth a pipe of tobacco
and eight hundred pounds is just the price of a little watteau i ve had my eye on for some investment
they strolled down the terrace and through one of the windows into the hall
firmin had lighted the lamps two of them
they made but a small oasis of light in a desert of dim hall
the millionaire let himself down very gingerly into an empire chair as if he feared with excellent reason that it might collapse under his weight
well my dear duke he said you don t ask me the result of my official lunch or what the minister said
is there any news said the duke carelessly
you can consider yourself decorated
i hope you feel a happy man said the millionaire rubbing his fat hands together with prodigious satisfaction
oh said the duke with entire indifference
as for me i m said the millionaire
i was extremely keen on your being decorated
after that and after a volume or two of travels and after you ve published your grandfather s letters with a good introduction you can begin to think of the academy
the academy said the duke startled from his usual coolness
but i ve no title to become an academician
how no title said the millionaire solemnly and his little eyes opened wide
there s no doubt about that said the duke watching him with admiring curiosity
i mean to marry my daughter to a worker my dear duke said the millionaire slapping his big left hand with his bigger right
i ve no i wish to have for a duke who wears the order of the legion of honour and belongs to the academie fran√ßaise because that is personal merit
a gentle irrepressible laugh broke from the duke
what are you laughing at said the millionaire and a sudden lowering gloom overspread his beaming face
only you re so full of surprises
it s true that i m full of surprises
i understand business and i love art pictures a good bargain fine tapestry
yes certainly i do love the beautiful
and i don t want to boast but i understand it
i have taste and i ve something better than taste i have a flair the dealer s flair
yes your collections especially your collection in paris prove it said the duke stifling a yawn
and yet you haven t seen the finest thing i coronet of the princesse de lamballe
it s worth half a million francs
so i ve heard said the duke a little wearily
i don t wonder that ars√®ne lupin envied you it
the empire chair creaked as the millionaire jumped
don t mention his name before me
germaine showed me his letter said the duke
i just missed a fit of apoplexy from it roared the millionaire
i was in this very hall where we are now chatting quietly when all at once in comes firmin and hands me a letter
he was interrupted by the opening of the door
firmin came clumping down the room and said in his deep voice a letter for you sir
thank you said the millionaire taking the letter and as he fitted his into his eye he went on yes firmin brought me a letter of which the handwriting raised the envelope he was holding to his eyes and bellowed good heavens
what s the matter said the duke jumping in his chair at the sudden startling burst of sound
the handwriting handwriting s the same handwriting gasped the millionaire
and he let himself fall heavily backwards against the back of his chair
the duke had a vision of huge arms and legs waving in the air as the gave
the huge bulk banged to the floor
the laughter of the duke rang out uncontrollably
he caught one of the waving arms and jerked the flabby giant to his feet with an ease which seemed to show that his muscles were of steel
what do you mean by the same handwriting
am i likely to make a mistake about it
and he tore open the envelope with an air of frenzy
he ran his eyes over it and they grew larger and grew almost of an average size
listen he said listen dear sir my collection of pictures which i had the pleasure of starting three years ago with some of your own only contains as far as old masters go one velasquez one rembrandt and three paltry rubens
since it is a shame such masterpieces should be in your hands i propose to appropriate them and i shall set about a respectful acquisition of them in your paris house tomorrow morning
yours very sincerely ars√®ne lupin
listen must understand that since you have been keeping the coronet of the princesse de lamballe during these three years i shall avail myself of the same occasion to compel you to restore that piece of jewellery to the thief
gasped the millionaire clutching at his collar
to judge from the blackness of his face and the way he staggered and dropped on to a couch which was fortunately stronger than the chair he was speaking the truth
he rushed to the side of the millionaire who gasped telephone
telephone to the prefecture of police
the duke loosened his collar with deft fingers tore a van loo fan from its case hanging on the wall and fanned him furiously
firmin came clumping into the room with a glass of water in his hand
the door opened and germaine and sonia alarmed by the duke s shout hurried in
sonia ran across the hall opened one of the drawers in the oriental cabinet and ran to the millionaire with a large bottle of in her hand
the duke took it from her and applied it to the millionaire s nose
the millionaire sneezed thrice with terrific violence
the duke snatched the glass from firmin and dashed the water into his host s purple face
the millionaire gasped and spluttered
germaine stood staring helplessly at her gasping sire
i told you said that lupin was in the neighbourhood cried germaine triumphantly
s firmin said the millionaire dragging himself upright
he seemed to have recovered a great deal of his voice
he jumped up caught the gamekeeper by the shoulder and shook him furiously
it was in the of the lodge at the bottom of the park
my wife found it there said firmin and he twisted out of the millionaire s grasp
just as it was three years ago roared the millionaire with an air of desperation
he made as if to tear out his hair then remembering its scantiness refrained
now come it s no use losing your head said the duke with quiet firmness
if this letter isn t a hoax bellowed the millionaire
but if this robbery with which you re threatened is genuine it s just childish
look at the date of the september the third
well what of it said the millionaire
look at the letter i shall set about a respectful acquisition of them in your paris house morning morning
yes yes morning of it said the millionaire
one of two things said the duke
either it s a hoax and we needn t bother about it or the threat is genuine and we have the time to stop the robbery
whatever was i thinking of said the millionaire
and his anguish cleared from his face
for once in a way our dear lupin s fondness for warning people will have given him a painful jar said the duke
let me get at the telephone cried the millionaire
but the telephone s no good said sonia quickly
why roared the millionaire dashing heavily across the room to it
look at the time said sonia the telephone doesn t work as late as this
you can always telegraph said germaine
you can t get a message through
it s sunday and the telegraph offices shut at twelve o clock
oh what a government groaned the millionaire
and he sank down gently on a chair beside the telephone and mopped the beads of anguish from his brow
they looked at him and they looked at one another cudgelling their brains for yet another way of communicating with the paris police
there must be some way out of the difficulty
he put his hands in his pockets and walked impatiently up and down the hall
sonia put her hands on the back of a couch and leaned forward watching him
firmin stood by the door whither he had retired to be out of the reach of his excited master with a look of perplexity on his stolid face
they all watched the duke with the air of people waiting for an oracle to deliver its message
the millionaire kept mopping the beads of anguish from his brow
the more he thought of his impending loss the more freely he perspired
germaine s maid irma came to the door leading into the outer hall which firmin according to his usual custom had left open and peered in wonder at the silent group
what is it said the millionaire rising and coming to the middle of the hall
what time is it said the duke pulling out his watch
the millionaire pulled out his watch
firmin after a struggle produced from some pocket difficult of access an object not unlike a silver turnip
there was a brisk dispute between germaine and the millionaire about which of their watches was right
firmin whose watch apparently did not agree with the watch of either of them made his deep voice heard above theirs
the duke came to the conclusion that it must be a few minutes past seven
it s seven or a few minutes past he said sharply
well i m going to take a car and hurry off to paris
i ought to get there bar accidents between two and three in the morning just in time to inform the police and catch the burglars in the very midst of their burglary
i ll just get a few things together
so saying he rushed out of the hall
excellent excellent said the millionaire
your young man is a man of resource germaine
it seems almost a pity that he s a duke
he d do wonders in the building trade
but i m going to paris too and you re coming with me
i couldn t wait idly here to save my life
and i can t leave you here either
this scoundrel may be going to make a simultaneous attempt on the that there s much here that i really value
there s that statuette that moved and the pane cut out of the window
i can t leave you two girls with burglars in the house
after all there s the sixty and the thirty ll be lots of room for all of us
oh but it s nonsense papa we shall get there before the servants said germaine pettishly
think of arriving at an empty house in the dead of night
sonia where are my keys of the paris house
they re in the bureau said sonia
well see that i don t go without them
firmin go and tell jean that we shall want both cars
i will drive one the duke the other
jean must stay with you and help guard the ch√¢teau
so saying he bustled out of the hall driving the two girls before him
chapter vi again the charolais hardly had the door closed behind the millionaire when the head of charolais appeared at one of the windows opening on to the terrace
he looked round the empty hall whistled softly and stepped inside
inside of ten seconds his three sons came in through the windows and with them came jean the millionaire s chauffeur
take the door into the outer hall jean said charolais in a low voice
bernard take that door into the
pierre and louis help me go through the drawers
the whole family is going to paris and if we re not quick we shan t get the cars
that comes of this silly fondness for warning people of a coup growled jean as he hurried to the door of the outer hall
it would have been so simple to rob the paris house without sending that infernal letter
it was sure to knock them all silly
what harm can the letter do you fool said charolais
we want them knocked silly for to get hold of the coronet
i ve been ransacking this ch√¢teau for hours
jean opened the door of the outer hall half an inch and glued his eyes to it
bernard had done the same with the door opening into the
charolais pierre and louis were opening drawers ransacking them and shutting them with infinite quickness and noiselessly
the place is stuffed with bureaux
that plain thing with the brass handles in the middle on the s a bureau said bernard softly
why didn t you say so growled charolais
the son he had described as an engineer came quickly to the bureau fitting together as he came the two halves of a small jemmy
he fitted it into the top of the flap
there was a crunch and the old lock gave
he opened the flap and he and charolais pulled open drawer after drawer
here s that fat old fool said jean in a hoarse hissing whisper
he moved down the hall blowing out one of the lamps as he passed it
in the seventh drawer lay a bunch of keys
charolais snatched it up glanced at it took a bunch of keys from his own pocket put it in the drawer closed it closed the flap and rushed to the window
jean and his sons were already out on the terrace
charolais was still a yard from the window when the door into the outer hall opened and in came
he caught a glimpse of a back vanishing through the window and bellowed hi
he ran blundering down the hall tangled his feet in the fragments of the broken chair and came sprawling a thundering cropper which knocked every breath of wind out of his capacious body
he lay flat on his face for a couple of minutes his broad back wriggling pathetic sight the painful effort to get his breath back
then he sat up and with perfect frankness burst into tears
he sobbed and blubbered like a small child that has hurt itself for three or four minutes
then having recovered his magnificent voice he bellowed furiously firmin
then he rose painfully to his feet and stood staring at the open windows
presently he roared again firmin
he kept looking at the window with terrified eyes as though he expected somebody to step in and cut his throat from ear to ear
the duke came quietly into the hall dressed in a heavy his on his head and carrying a in his hand
he was bolting through the middle window
nerves be hanged said the millionaire
i tell you i saw him as plainly as i see you
well you can t see me at all seeing that you re lighting an acre and a half of hall with a single lamp said the duke still in a tone of utter incredulity
firmin bellowed the millionaire
they listened for the sonorous clumping of the promoted gamekeeper s boots but they did not hear it
evidently firmin was still giving his master s instructions about the cars to jean
well we may as well shut the windows anyhow said the duke proceeding to do so
if you think firmin would be any good you might post him in this hall with a gun
there could be no harm in putting a charge of small shot into the legs of these ruffians
he has only to get one of them and the others will go for their lives
yet i don t like leaving you and germaine in this big house with only firmin to look after you
i shouldn t like it myself and i m not going to chance it growled the millionaire
we re going to motor to paris along with you and leave jean to help firmin fight these burglars
not that i ve much belief in soldiers against this cursed lupin after the way he dealt with that corporal and his men three years ago
i m glad you re coming to paris said the duke
i d better drive the limousine and you take the landaulet
that won t do said the millionaire
germaine won t go in the limousine
you know she has taken a dislike to it
nevertheless i d better bucket on to paris and let you follow slowly with germaine
the sooner i get to paris the better for your collection
i ll take mademoiselle kritchnoff with me and if you like irma though the lighter i travel the sooner i shall get there
no i ll take irma and germaine said the millionaire
germaine would prefer to have irma with her in case you had an accident
she wouldn t like to get to paris and have to find a fresh maid
the door opened and in came germaine followed by sonia and irma
i think it s extremely tiresome your dragging us off to paris like this in the middle of the night said germaine pettishly
well then you ll be interested to hear that i ve just seen a burglar here in this very room
i frightened him and he bolted through the window on to the terrace
he was slightly tinged with yellow said the duke softly
oh do stop your jesting jacques
is this a time for idiocy cried germaine in a tone of acute exasperation
it was the dim light which made your father see him in those colours
in a bright light i think he would have been an alsatian blue said the duke suavely
you ll have to break yourself of this silly habit of trifling my dear duke if ever you expect to be a member of the academie fran√ßaise said the millionaire with some acrimony
it was his colour i was talking about said the duke with an ironical smile
we re all sick to death of them said germaine with something of the fine fury which so often distinguished her father
there are times for all things said the millionaire solemnly
and i must say that with the fate of my collection and of the coronet trembling in the balance this does not seem to me a season for idle jests
i stand reproved said the duke and he smiled at sonia
my keys keys of the paris house said the millionaire
sonia took her own keys from her pocket and went to the bureau
she slipped a key into the lock and tried to turn it
it would not turn and she bent down to look at it
some one s been tampering with the lock
cried the millionaire triumphantly
sonia drew back the flap of the bureau and hastily pulled open the drawer in which the keys had been
she cried taking them out of the drawer and holding them up
then i was just in time said the millionaire
i startled him in the very act of stealing the keys
you did see a burglar evidently
however you d better give me those keys mademoiselle sonia since i m to get to paris first
i should look rather silly if when i got there i had to break into the house to catch the burglars
sonia handed the keys to the duke
he contrived to take her little hand keys and all into his own as he received them and squeezed it
the light was too dim for the others to see the flush which flamed in her face
she went back and stood beside the bureau
now papa are you going to motor to paris in a thin coat and linen waistcoat
you always do keep us waiting half an hour whenever we start to go anywhere said germaine firmly
the millionaire bustled out of the room
with a gesture of impatience germaine dropped into a chair
there came a sharp patter of rain against the windows
it s going to be perfectly beastly
oh well you must make the best of it
at any rate you re well wrapped up and the night is warm enough though it is raining said the duke
still i could have wished that lupin confined his operations to fine weather
he paused and added cheerfully but after all it will lay the dust
they sat for three or four minutes in a dull silence listening to the pattering of the rain against the panes
the duke took his from his pocket and lighted a cigarette
suddenly he lost his bored air his face lighted up and he said joyfully of course why didn t
why should we start from a pit of gloom like this
let us have the proper illumination which our enterprise deserves
with that he set about lighting all the lamps in the hall
there were lamps on stands lamps on brackets lamps on tables and lamps which hung from the lamps with new reservoirs new lamps of what is called chaste design brass lamps silver lamps and lamps in porcelain
the duke lighted them one after another patiently missing none with a cold perseverance
the operation was punctuated by exclamations from germaine
they were all to the effect that she could not understand how he could be such a fool
the duke paid no attention whatever to her
his face illumined with boyish glee he lighted lamp after lamp
sonia watched him with a smiling admiration of the childlike enthusiasm with which he performed the task
even the stolid face of the irma relaxed into grins which she smoothed quickly out with a respectful hand
the duke had just lighted the lamp when in bustled the millionaire
what s this he cried stopping short blinking
just some more of jacques foolery
cried germaine in tones of the last exasperation
the oil oil cried the millionaire in a tone of bitter distress
do you think it s my object in life to swell the rockefeller millions
we never have more than six lamps burning unless we are holding a reception
i think it looks so cheerful said the duke looking round on his handiwork with a beaming smile of satisfaction
jean seems a deuce of a time bringing them round
does he expect us to go to the garage through this rain
come on you ve got a good carrying voice
he caught the millionaire by the arm hurried him through the outer hall opened the big door of the ch√¢teau and said now shout
the millionaire looked at him shrugged his shoulders and said you don t beat about the bush when you want anything
why should i said the duke simply
the millionaire raised his voice in a terrific bellow of jean jean
the night was very black the rain pattered in their faces
again the millionaire bellowed jean
no answer came out of the darkness though his bellow echoed and among the and stables away on the left
he turned and looked at the duke and said uneasily what on earth can they be doing
i suppose we must go and hunt them out
in this darkness with these burglars about said the millionaire starting back
if we don t nobody else will said the duke
and all the time that rascal lupin is stealing nearer and nearer your pictures
he seized the reluctant millionaire by the arm and drew him down the steps
they took their way to the stables
a dim light shone from the open door of the
the duke went into it first and stopped short
he cried instead of three cars the held but hundred mercrac
it was a racing car with only two seats
on them sat two figures jean and firmin
you idle dogs bellowed the millionaire
neither of the men answered nor did they stir
the light from the lamp gleamed on their fixed eyes which stared at their infuriated master
what on earth is this said the duke and seizing the lamp which stood beside the car he raised it so that its light fell on the two figures
then it was clear what had happened they were trussed like two fowls and gagged
the duke pulled a penknife from his pocket opened the blade stepped into the car and set firmin free
firmin coughed and spat and swore
well said the duke in a tone of cutting irony what new game is this
they came on us unawares from behind said jean
they tied us up and gagged swine said firmin
and went off in the two cars said jean went off in the two cars cried the millionaire in blank stupefaction
the duke burst into a shout of laughter
well your dear friend lupin doesn t do things by halves he cried
this is the funniest thing i ever heard of
what about my pictures and the coronet
the duke laughed his laugh out then changed on the instant to a man of action
well this means a change in our plans he said
i must get to paris in this car here
it s such a rotten old thing said the millionaire
i daresay it s better than you think
and after all it s only a matter of two hundred miles
he paused and then said in an anxious tone all the same i don t like leaving you and germaine in the ch√¢teau
these rogues have probably only taken the cars out of reach just to prevent your getting to paris
they ll leave them in some field and come back
you re not going to leave us behind
i wouldn t spend the night in the ch√¢teau for a million francs
there s always the train said the millionaire
twelve hours in the all those changes
you don t mean that you will actually go to paris by train said the duke
come must go and tell germaine there s no time to waste and he hurried off to the ch√¢teau
get the lamps lighted jean and make sure that the tank s full
as for the engine i must humour it and trust to luck
i ll get her to paris somehow said the duke
he went back to the ch√¢teau and firmin followed him
when the duke came into the great hall he found germaine and her father indulging in recriminations
she was declaring that nothing would induce her to make the journey by train her father was declaring that she should
he bore down her opposition by the mere force of his magnificent voice
when at last there came a silence sonia said quietly but is there a train
i know there s a train at midnight but is there one before
now where did i see a said the duke
oh i know there s one in the drawer of that oriental cabinet
crossing to the cabinet he opened the drawer took out the and handed it to
the millionaire took it and turned over the leaves quickly ran his eye down a page and said yes thank goodness there is a train
there s one at a quarter to nine
how are we to get to the station said germaine
they looked at one another blankly
firmin who had followed the duke into the hall came to the rescue
the cried germaine contemptuously
the very thing said the millionaire
off you go firmin harness a horse to it
firmin went clumping out of the hall
it was perhaps as well that he went for the duke asked what time it was and since the watches of germaine and her father differed still there ensued an altercation in which had firmin been there he would doubtless have taken part
the duke cut it short by saying well i don t think i ll wait to see you start for the station
it won t take you more than half an hour
i d better get off as soon as the car is ready
it isn t as though i could trust it
i m not going to be starved as well as have my night s rest cut to pieces
of course there isn t a snapped her father
we must eat something now and take something with us
be off to the larder and see what you can find
tell mother firmin to make an omelette
sonia went towards the door of the hall followed by irma
and bon voyage mademoiselle sonia said the duke
and bon voyage your grace said sonia
the duke opened the door of the hall for her and as she went out she said anxiously in a low voice oh be careful
i hate to think of your hurrying to paris on a night like this
i will be careful said the duke
the honk of the told him that jean had brought the car to the door of the ch√¢teau
he came down the room kissed germaine s hands shook hands with the millionaire and bade them
they heard it start the rattle of it grew fainter and fainter down the long avenue and died away
arose and began putting out lamps
as he did so he kept casting fearful glances at the window as if he feared lest now that the duke had gone the burglars should dash in upon him
there came a knock at the door and jean appeared on the threshold
his grace told me that i was to come into the house and help firmin look after it he said
the millionaire gave him instructions about the guarding of the house
firmin since he was an old soldier was to occupy the post of honour and guard the hall armed with his gun
jean was to guard the two as being less likely points of attack
he also was to have a gun and the millionaire went with him to the and gave him one and a dozen cartridges
when they came back to the hall sonia called them into the and there to the accompaniment of an unsubdued grumbling from germaine at having to eat cold food at eight at night they made a hasty but excellent meal since the chef had left an elaborate cold supper ready to be served
they had nearly finished it when jean came in his gun on his arm to say that firmin had harnessed the horse to the and it was awaiting them at the door of the ch√¢teau
send him in to me and stand by the horse till we come out said the millionaire
the millionaire gazed at him solemnly and said firmin i am relying on you
i am leaving you in a position of honour and position which an old soldier of france loves
firmin did his best to look like an old soldier of france
he pulled himself up out of the slouch which long years of loafing through woods with a gun on his arm had given him
he lacked also the old soldier of france s fiery gaze
i look for anything violence an armed assault said the millionaire
i saw the war of  said firmin boldly rising to the occasion
he rose and saying come along we must be getting to the station he led the way to the door of the ch√¢teau
the stood rather high and they had to bring a chair out of the hall to enable the girls to climb into it
germaine did not forget to give her real opinion of the advantages of a seat formed by a plank resting on the sides of the cart
the millionaire climbed heavily up in front and took the reins
never again will i trust only to
the first thing i ll do after i ve made sure that my collections are safe will be to buy roomy he said gloomily as he realized the discomfort of his seat
he turned to jean and firmin who stood on the steps of the ch√¢teau watching the departure of their master and said sons of france be brave
the cart bumped off into the damp dark night
jean and firmin watched it disappear into the darkness
then they came into the ch√¢teau and shut the door
firmin looked at jean and said gloomily i don t like this
these burglars stick at nothing
they d as soon cut your throat as look at you
besides you ve got the post of honour
they re not likely to break in through the
and i shall lock the door between them and the hall
you d better come and get a gun
they went to the firmin still protesting against the locking of the door between the and the hall
he chose his gun and they went into the kitchen
jean took two bottles of wine a pie a sweet and carried them to the
he came back into the hall gathered together an armful of papers and magazines and went back to the
firmin kept trotting after him like a little dog with a somewhat heavy footfall
on the threshold of the jean paused and said the important thing with burglars is to fire first old cock
he shut the door and turned the key
firmin stared at the decorated panels blankly
the beauty of the scheme of decoration did not at the moment move him to admiration
he looked fearfully round the empty hall and at the windows black against the night
under the patter of the rain he heard
he went hastily clumping down the hall and along the passage to the kitchen
his wife was setting his supper on the table
i haven t been so frightened since
and he mopped his glistening forehead with a
it was not a clean but he did not care
he told her of the fears of and of his own appointment to the honourable and dangerous post of guard of the ch√¢teau
you lock the door of that beastly hall and come into the kitchen
burglars won t bother about the kitchen
let the master look after his treasures himself said madame firmin with decision
you ve only one throat and i m not going to have it cut
you sit down and eat your supper
go and lock that door first though
firmin locked the door of the hall then he locked the door of the kitchen then he sat down and began to eat his supper
his appetite was hearty but none the less he derived little pleasure from the meal
he kept stopping with the food poised on his fork midway between the plate and his mouth for several seconds at a time while he listened with straining ears for the sound of burglars breaking in the windows of the hall
he was much too far from those windows to hear anything that happened to them but that did not prevent him from straining his ears
madame firmin ate her supper with an air of perfect ease
she felt sure that burglars would not bother with the kitchen
firmin s anxiety made him terribly thirsty
tumbler after tumbler of wine flowed down the throat for which he feared
when he had finished his supper he went on satisfying his thirst
madame firmin lighted his pipe for him and went and washed up the in the scullery
then she came back and sat down on the other side of the hearth facing him
about the middle of his third bottle of wine firmin s cold relentless courage was suddenly restored to him
he began to talk firmly about his duty to his master his resolve to die if need were in defence of his interests of his utter contempt for parisians
but he did not go into the hall
doubtless the pleasant warmth of the kitchen fire held him in his chair
he had described to his wife with some ferocity the cruel manner in which he would annihilate the first three burglars who entered the hall and was proceeding to describe his method of dealing with the fourth when there came a loud knocking on the front door of the ch√¢teau
stricken silent turned to stone firmin sat with his mouth open in the midst of an unfinished word
madame firmin scuttled to the kitchen door she had left unlocked on her return from the scullery and locked it
she turned and they stared at one another
the heavy knocker fell again and again and again
between the knocking there was a sound like the roaring of lions
husband and wife stared at one another with white faces
firmin picked up his gun with trembling hands and the movement seemed to set his teeth chattering
the knocking still went on and so did the roaring
it had gone on at least for five minutes when a slow gleam of comprehension lightened madame firmin s face
i believe it s the master s voice she said
the master s voice said firmin in a hoarse terrified whisper
and she unlocked the thick door and opened it a few inches
the barrier removed the bellow of the millionaire came distinctly to their ears
firmin s courage rushed upon him in full flood
he clumped across the room brushed his wife aside and trotted to the door of the ch√¢teau
he unlocked it drew the bolts and threw it open
on the steps stood the millionaire germaine and sonia
what the devil have you been doing bellowed the millionaire
what do you keep me standing in the rain for
thought you were stammered firmin
at the moment he did not he sounded more like a bull of bashan
he bustled past firmin to the door of the hall
it in case burglars should get in while i was opening the front door stammered firmin
the millionaire turned the key opened the door and went into the hall
she threw off her dripping coat and said with some heat i can t conceive why you didn t make sure that there was a train at a quarter to nine
nothing shall induce me to take that midnight train
he rushed to the table on to which he had thrown the after looking up the train snatched it up and looked at the cover
oh cried germaine almost in a scream
chapter viii the duke arrives the morning was gloomy and the with its bare white expanse was only broken by to which were pinned portraits of criminals with details of their appearance their crime and the reward offered for their its shabby furniture and its dingy fireplace presented a dismal and sordid appearance entirely in keeping with the september grey
the inspector sat at his desk yawning after a night which had passed without an arrest
the policeman at the door and the two policemen sitting on a bench by the wall yawned in sympathy
the silence of the street was broken by the rattle of an uncommonly noisy
it stopped before the door of the and the eyes of the inspector and his men turned idly expectant to the door of the office
it opened and a young man in and cap stood on the threshold
he looked round the office with alert eyes which took in everything and said in a brisk incisive voice i am the duke of charmerace
last evening he received a letter from ars√®ne lupin saying he was going to break into his paris house this very morning
at the name of ars√®ne lupin the inspector sprang from his chair the policemen from their bench
on the instant they were wide awake attentive full of zeal
the letter your grace said the inspector briskly
the duke pulled off his glove drew the letter from the of his and handed it to the inspector
the inspector glanced through it and said
yes i know the handwriting well
then he read it carefully and added yes yes it s his usual letter
there s no time to be lost said the duke quickly
i ought to have been here hours
i m afraid i m too late as it is
come along your along you said the inspector briskly
the four of them hurried out of the office and down the steps of the
in the roadway stood a long grey caked with mud brown mud red end to end
it looked as if it had brought samples of the soil of france from many districts
come along i ll take you in the car
your men can trot along beside us said the duke to the inspector
he slipped into the car the inspector jumped in and took the seat beside him and they started
they went slowly to allow the two policemen to keep up with them
indeed the car could not have made any great pace for the tyre of the off was punctured and deflated
in three minutes they came to the house a mass of undistinguished masonry in an undistinguished row of exactly the same pattern
there were no signs that any one was living in it
blinds were drawn shutters were up over all the windows upper and lower
no smoke came from any of its chimneys though indeed it was full early for that
pulling a bunch of keys from his pocket the duke ran up the steps
the duke looked at the bunch picked out the and fitted it into the lock
he drew it out and tried another key and another
let me your grace said the inspector
the duke handed the keys to him and one after another the inspector fitted them into the lock
they ve given me the wrong keys said the duke with some vexation
when where last night at charmerace said the duke
m declared that he saw a burglar slip out of one of the windows of the hall of the ch√¢teau and we found the lock of the bureau in which the keys were kept broken
the inspector seized the knocker and hammered on the door
try that door there he cried to his men pointing to a on the right the tradesmen s entrance giving access to the back of the house
there came no sound of movement in the house in answer to the inspector s knocking
the duke shrugged his shoulders
there s a housekeeper woman named victoire he said
let s hope we don t find them with their throats cut
that isn t lupin s way said the inspector
they won t have come to much harm
it s not very likely that they ll be in a position to open doors said the duke drily
hadn t we better have it broken open and be done with it
people don t like their doors broken open he said
and oh i ll take the responsibility of that said the duke
oh if you say so your grace said the inspector with a brisk relief
henri go to ragoneau the locksmith in the rue theobald
bring him here as quickly as ever you can get him
tell him it s a couple of louis if he s here inside of ten minutes said the duke
the inspector bent down and searched the steps carefully
the duke lighted a cigarette and watched him
the house of the millionaire stood next but one to the corner of a street which ran at right angles to the one in which it stood and the corner house was empty
the inspector searched the road then he went round the corner
the other policeman went along the road searching in the opposite direction
the duke leant against the door and smoked on patiently
he showed none of the weariness of a man who has spent the night in a long and anxious drive in a rickety
his eyes were bright and clear he looked as fresh as if he had come from his bed after a long night s rest
if he had not found the south pole he had at any rate brought back fine powers of endurance from his expedition in search of it
the inspector came back wearing a disappointed air
have you found anything said the duke
he came up the steps and hammered again on the door
there was a clatter of footsteps and henri and the locksmith a burly bearded man his bag of tools slung over his shoulder came hurrying up
he was not long getting to work but it was not an easy job
at the end of five minutes he said that he might spend an hour struggling with the lock itself should he cut away a piece of the door round it
the locksmith changed his tools and in less than three minutes he had cut away a square piece from the door a square in which the lock was fixed and taken it bodily away
the inspector drew his revolver and entered the house
the policemen drew their revolvers and followed the duke
the big hall was but dimly lighted
one of the policemen quickly threw back the shutters of the windows and let in the light
the hall was empty the furniture in perfect order there were no signs of burglary there
the concierge said the inspector and his men hurried through the little door on the right which opened into the concierge s rooms
in half a minute one of them came out and said gagged and bound and his wife too
but the rooms which were to be plundered are upstairs said the the big on the first floor
the scoundrels may not yet have got away
he ran quickly up the stairs followed by the inspector and hurried along the corridor to the door of the big
he threw it open and stopped dead on the threshold
chairs were overturned there were empty spaces on the wall where the finest pictures of the millionaire had been hung
the window facing the door was wide open
the shutters were broken one of them was hanging crookedly from only its bottom hinge
the top of a ladder rose above the and beside it astraddle the sill was an empire half inside the room half out
on the before a large tapestry which masked the wide fireplace built in imitation of the big wide fireplaces of our ancestors and rose to the level of the magnificent in carved some chairs tied together ready to be removed
the duke and the inspector ran to the window and looked down into the garden
at the further end of it on the other side of its wall rose the scaffolding of a house
the burglars had found every convenience to their strong ladder an egress through the door in the garden wall and then through the gap formed by the house in process of erection which had rendered them independent of the narrow passage between the walls of the gardens which debouched into a on the right
the duke turned from the window glanced at the wall opposite then as if something had caught his eye went quickly to it
look here he said and he pointed to the middle of one of the empty spaces in which a picture had hung
there written neatly in blue chalk were the words ars√®ne lupin this is a job for guerchard said the inspector
but i had better get an examining magistrate to take the matter in hand first
the duke opened the folding doors which led into the second
the shutters of the windows were open and it was plain that ars√®ne lupin had plundered it also of everything that had struck his fancy
in the gaps between the pictures on the walls was again the signature ars√®ne lupin
the inspector was shouting impatiently into the telephone bidding a servant wake her master instantly
he did not leave the telephone till he was sure that she had done so that her master was actually awake and had been informed of the crime
the duke sat down in an easy chair and waited for him
when he had finished telephoning the inspector began to search the two rooms for traces of the burglars
when he had gone through the two rooms he said the next thing to do is to find the
she may be sleeping may not even have heard the noise of the burglars
i find all this extremely interesting said the duke and he followed the inspector out of the room
the inspector called up the two policemen who had been freeing the concierge and going through the rooms on the
they did not then examine any more of the rooms on the first floor to discover if they also had been plundered
they went straight up to the top of the house the servants quarters
two or three times but there was no answer
they opened the door of room after room and looked in the inspector taking the rooms on the right the policemen the rooms on the left
here we are said one of the policemen
this room s been recently occupied
they looked in and saw that the bed was unmade
plainly victoire had slept in it
i expect she s with the accomplice
i gather that had the greatest confidence in her said the duke
he ll have less now said the inspector drily
it s generally the confidential ones who let their masters down
the inspector and his men set about a thorough search of the house
they found the other rooms undisturbed
in half an hour they had established the fact that the burglars had confined their attention to the two
they found no traces of them and they did not find victoire
the concierge could throw no light on her disappearance
he and his wife had been taken by surprise in their sleep and in the dark
they had been gagged and bound they declared without so much as having set eyes on their assailants
the duke and the inspector came back to the plundered
the inspector looked at his watch and went to the telephone
i must let the prefecture know he said
be sure you ask them to send guerchard said the duke
guerchard said the inspector doubtfully
m formery the examining magistrate does not get on very well with guerchard
he s very capable said the inspector quickly
but he doesn t have very good luck
m particularly asked me to send for guerchard if i arrived too late and found the burglary already committed said the duke
it seems that there is war to the knife between guerchard and this ars√®ne lupin
in that case guerchard will leave no stone unturned to catch the rascal and recover the stolen treasures
felt that guerchard was the man for this piece of work very strongly indeed
very good your grace said the inspector
and he rang up the prefecture of police
the duke heard him report the crime and ask that guerchard should be sent
the official in charge at the moment seemed to make some demur
the duke sprang to his feet and said in an anxious tone perhaps i d better speak to him myself
he took his place at the telephone and said i am the duke of charmerace
begged me to secure the services of guerchard
he laid the greatest stress on my securing them if on reaching paris i found that the crime had already been committed
the official at the other end of the line hesitated
he did not refuse on the instant as he had refused the inspector
it may be that he reflected that was a millionaire and a man of influence that the duke of charmerace was a duke that he at any rate had nothing whatever to gain by running counter to their wishes
he said that guerchard was not at the prefecture that he was off duty that he would send down two detectives who were on duty at once and summon guerchard with all speed
the duke thanked him and rang off
that s all right he said cheerfully turning to the inspector
well i don t expect him for another hour said the inspector
he won t come till he s had his breakfast
he always makes a good breakfast before setting out to start an inquiry lest he shouldn t find time to make one after he s begun it
now you come to remind me i m absolutely famished
i got some supper on my way late last night but i ve had nothing since
i suppose nothing interesting will happen till formery comes and i may as well get some food
but i don t want to leave the house
i think i ll see what the concierge can do for me
so saying he went downstairs and interviewed the concierge
the concierge seemed to be still doubtful whether he was standing on his head or his heels but he undertook to supply the needs of the duke
the duke gave him a louis and he hurried off to get food from a restaurant
the duke went upstairs to the bathroom and refreshed himself with a cold bath
by the time he had bathed and dressed the concierge had a meal ready for him in the
he ate it with the heartiest appetite
then he sent out for a barber and was shaved
he then repaired to the pillaged disposed himself in the most restful attitude on a sofa and lighted an excellent cigar
in the middle of it the inspector came to him
he was not wearing a very cheerful air and he told the duke that he had found no clue to the perpetrators of the crime though dieusy and bonavent the detectives from the prefecture of police had joined him in the search
the duke was condoling with him on this failure when they heard a knocking at the front door and then voices on the stairs
here is formery said the inspector cheerfully
chapter ix formery opens the inquiry
the examining magistrate came into the room
he was a plump and pink little man with very bright eyes
his bristly hair stood up straight all over his head giving it the appearance of a broad
he appeared to be of the opinion that nature had given the world the toothbrush as a model of what a moustache should be and his own was clipped to that pattern
the duke of charmerace formery said the inspector
the little man bowed and said charmed charmed to make your acquaintance your the occasion is somewhat painful
the treasures of are known to all the world
he paused and added hastily but we shall recover shall recover them
the duke rose bowed and protested his pleasure at making the acquaintance of formery
is this the scene of the robbery inspector said formery and he rubbed his hands together with a very cheerful air
these two rooms seem to be the only ones touched though of course we can t tell till arrives
jewels may have been stolen from the bedrooms
i fear that won t be of much help for some days said the duke
when i left him he was nearly distracted and he won t be any better after a night journey to paris from charmerace
but probably these are the only two rooms touched for in them had gathered together the gems of his collection
over the doors hung some pieces of flemish composition colouring delightful
it is easy to see that your grace was very fond of them said formery
i should think so said the duke
i looked on them as already belonging to me for my was going to give them to me as a wedding present
but we will recover them sooner or later you can rest assured of it
i hope you have touched nothing in this room
if anything has been moved it may put me off the scent altogether
let me have the details inspector
the inspector reported the arrival of the duke at the with ars√®ne lupin s letter to the discovery that the keys had been changed and would not open the door of the house the opening of it by the locksmith the discovery of the concierge and his wife gagged and bound
probably accomplices said formery
does lupin always work with accomplices said the duke
pardon my i ve been out of france for so he attained to this height of notoriety
why there is the letter from lupin which my future received last night its arrival was followed by the theft of his two swiftest and then these signatures on the wall here said the duke in some surprise at the question
everybody has lupin on the brain
this letter and these signatures are just as likely to be forgeries as not
i wonder if guerchard will take that view said the duke
surely we re not going to be cluttered up with guerchard
he has lupin on the brain worse than any one else
but particularly asked me to send for guerchard if i arrived too late to prevent the burglary
he would never forgive me if i had neglected his request so i telephoned for the prefecture of police said the duke
oh well if you ve already telephoned for him
but it was unnecessary said formery sharply
i didn t know said the duke politely
oh there was no harm in doesn t matter said formery in a discontented tone with a discontented air
he walked slowly round the room paused by the windows looked at the ladder and scanned the garden ars√®ne lupin he said scornfully
ars√®ne lupin doesn t leave traces all over the place
are we going to have that silly lupin joke all over again
i think sir that this time joke is the word for this is a burglary pure and simple said the inspector
yes it s plain as daylight said formery the burglars came in by this window and they went out by it
he crossed the room to a tall safe which stood before the unused door
the safe was covered with velvet and velvet curtains hung before its door
he drew the curtains and tried the handle of the door of the safe
it did not turn the safe was locked
as far as i can see they haven t touched this said formery
thank goodness for that said the duke
i believe or at least my fianc√©e does that keeps the most precious thing in his collection in that coronet
the famous coronet of the princesse de lamballe said formery
but according to your report inspector the letter signed lupin announced that he was going to steal the coronet also
well here is a further proof that we re not dealing with lupin
that rascal would certainly have put his threat into execution formery said the inspector
who s in charge of the house said formery
the concierge his wife and a woman named victoire said the inspector
i ll see to the concierge and his wife presently
i ve sent one of your men round for their dossier
when i get it i ll question them
you found them gagged and bound in their bedroom
yes formery and always this imitation of yellow gag blue cords and the motto i take therefore i am on a scrap of usual bag of tricks
then once again they re going to touch us up in the papers
it s any odds on it said formery gloomily
the fact is we don t know where she is said the inspector
you don t know where she is said formery
we can t find her anywhere said the inspector
we ve found the accomplice said formery with lively delight and he rubbed his hands together
at least we haven t found her but we know her
i don t think that s the case said the duke
at least my future and my fianc√©e had both of them the greatest confidence in her
yesterday she telephoned to us at the ch√¢teau de charmerace
all the jewels were left in her charge and the wedding presents as they were sent in
and these jewels and wedding they been stolen too said formery
they don t seem to have been touched said the duke though of course we can t tell till arrives
as far as i can see the burglars have only touched these two
that s very annoying said formery
i don t find it so said the duke smiling
i was looking at it from the professional point of view said formery
he turned to the inspector and added you can t have searched thoroughly
this housekeeper must be somewhere she s really trustworthy
have you looked in every room in the house
in every every every corner and every cupboard said the inspector
are there no scraps of torn clothes no no traces of murder nothing of interest
but this is very regrettable said formery
her room is at the top of the house said the inspector
the bed had been slept in but she does not appear to have taken away any of her clothes
this is beginning to look a very complicated business said formery gravely
perhaps guerchard will be able to throw a little more light on it said the duke
formery frowned and said yes yes
guerchard is a good assistant in a business like this
a little visionary a little in fact but after all he is guerchard
only since lupin is his bugbear he s bound to find some means of muddling us up with that wretched animal
you re going to see lupin mixed up with all this to a dead certainty your grace
the duke looked at the signatures on the wall
it seems to me that he is pretty well mixed up with it already he said quietly
believe me your grace in a criminal affair it is above all things necessary to distrust appearances
i am growing more and more confident that some ordinary burglars have committed this crime and are trying to put us off the scent by diverting our attention to lupin
the duke stooped down carelessly and picked up a book which had fallen from a table
excuse me but not touch anything said formery quickly
why this is odd said the duke staring at the floor
well this book looks as if it had been knocked off the table by one of the burglars
and look here here s a footprint under footprint on the carpet said the duke
formery and the inspector came quickly to the spot
there where the book had fallen plainly imprinted on the carpet was a white footprint
formery and the inspector stared at it
how did plaster get here said formery frowning at it
well suppose the robbers came from the garden said the duke
of course they came from the garden your grace
where else should they come from said formery with a touch of impatience in his tone
well at the end of the garden they re building a house said the duke
of course of course said formery taking him up quickly
the burglars came here with their boots covered with plaster
they ve swept away all the other marks of their feet from the carpet but whoever did the sweeping was too slack to lift up that book and sweep under it
this footprint however is not of great importance though it is corroborative of all the other evidence we have that they came and went by the garden
there s the ladder and that table half out of the window
still this footprint may turn out useful after all
you had better take the measurements of it inspector
i make a point of carrying this about with me your grace
you would be surprised to learn how often it has come in useful
he took a little ivory from his pocket and gave it to the inspector who fell on his knees and measured the footprint with the greatest care
i must take a careful look at that house they re building
i shall find a good many traces there to a dead certainty said formery
the inspector entered the measurements of the footprint in his
there came the sound of a knocking at the front door
i shall find footprints of exactly the same dimensions as this one at the foot of some heap of plaster beside that house said formery with an air of profound conviction pointing through the window to the house building beyond the garden
a policeman opened the door of the and saluted
if you please sir the servants have arrived from charmerace he said
let them wait in the kitchen and the servants offices said formery
he stood silent buried in profound meditation for a couple of minutes
then he turned to the duke and said what was that you said about a theft of at charmerace
when he received the letter from ars√®ne lupin decided to start for paris at once said the duke
but when we sent for the cars we found that they had just been stolen
s chauffeur and another servant were in the garage gagged and bound
only an old car a hundred mercrac was left
i drove it to paris leaving and his family to come on by train
very important indeed said formery
he thought for a moment and then added
were the the only things stolen
well as a matter of fact there was another theft or rather an attempt at theft said the duke with some hesitation
the rogues who stole the presented themselves at the ch√¢teau under the name of father and three the pretext of buying the mercrac
had advertised it for sale in the rennes advertiser
they were waiting in the big hall of the ch√¢teau which the family uses as the chief for the return of
he came and as they left the hall one of them attempted to steal a pendant set with pearls which i had given to mademoiselle half an hour before
i caught him in the act and saved the pendant
have one of the till i question him said formery rubbing his hands and his eyes sparkled with joy
well no i m afraid we haven t said the duke in an apologetic tone
oh those country police cried formery
no i didn t charge him with the theft said the duke
you didn t charge him with the theft
no he was very young and he begged so hard
your duty to society cried formery
yes it does seem to have been rather weak said the duke but there you are
it s no good crying over spilt milk
formery folded his arms and walked frowning backwards and forwards across the room
he stopped raised his hand with a gesture commanding attention and said i have no hesitation in saying that there is a intimate the thefts at charmerace and this burglary
the duke and the inspector gazed at him with respectful least the eyes of the inspector were respectful the duke s eyes twinkled
i am gathering up the threads said formery
inspector bring up the concierge and his wife
i will question them on the scene of the crime
if it is bring it up with them if not no matter bring them up without it
formery plunged at once into frowning meditation
i find all this extremely interesting said the duke
said formery waving his hand with an air
the inspector entered the followed by the concierge and his wife
the concierge a bearded man of about sixty and his wife a somewhat bearded woman of about stared at formery with fascinated terrified eyes
he sat down in a chair crossed his legs read the paper through and then scrutinized them keenly
well have you recovered from your adventure he said
they hustled us a bit but they did not really hurt us
nothing to speak of that is said his wife
but all the same it s a disgraceful thing that an honest woman can t sleep in peace in her bed of a night without being disturbed by rascals like that
and if the police did their duty things like this wouldn t happen
and i don t care who hears me say it
you say that you were taken by surprise in your sleep said formery
you say you saw nothing and heard nothing
there was no time to see anything or hear anything
they trussed us up like greased lightning said the concierge
but the gag was the worst said the wife
to lie there and not be able to tell the rascals what i thought about them
didn t you hear the noise of footsteps in the garden said formery
one can t hear anything that happens in the garden from our bedroom said the concierge
germaine s great dane barked from twelve o clock till seven in the morning all the household was kept awake except us but bless you sir we slept like tops said his wife proudly
if they sleep like that it seems rather a waste of time to have gagged them whispered the duke to the inspector
the inspector grinned and whispered scornfully oh them common folks they do sleep like that your grace
didn t you hear any noise at the front door said formery
no we heard no noise at the door said the concierge
then you heard no noise at all the whole night said formery
oh yes sir we heard noise enough after we d been gagged said the concierge
now this is important said formery
well it was a bumping kind of noise said the concierge
and there was a noise of footsteps walking about the room
where did these noises come from said formery
from the room over our big said the concierge
didn t you hear any noise of a struggle as if somebody was being dragged screaming or crying said formery
the concierge and his wife looked at one another with inquiring eyes
then he said how long have you been in the service of
a little more than a year said the concierge
formery looked at the paper in his hand frowned and said severely i see you ve been convicted twice my man
yes sir my husband s an honest man honest broke in his wife
you ve only to ask he be so good as to keep quiet my good woman said formery and turning to her husband he went on at your first conviction you were sentenced to a day s imprisonment with costs at your second conviction you got three days imprisonment
i m not going to deny it sir said the concierge but it was an honourable imprisonment
the first time i was a gentleman s servant and i got a day s imprisonment for crying hurrah for the general strike the first of may
in the service of genlis the socialist leader
and your second conviction said formery
it was for having cried in the porch of ste clotilde down with the cows the police sir said the concierge
and were you in the service of genlis then said formery
no sir i was in the service of the royalist deputy
you don t seem to have very political convictions said formery
oh yes sir i have the concierge protested
i m always devoted to my masters and i have the same opinions that they
very good you can go said formery
the concierge and his wife left the room looking as if they did not quite know whether to feel relieved or not
those two fools are telling the exact truth unless i m very much mistaken said formery
they look honest enough people said the duke
well now to examine the rest of the house said formery
i ll come with you if i may said the duke
by all means by all means said formery
i find it all so interesting said the duke chapter x guerchard assists leaving a policeman on guard at the door of the formery the duke and the inspector set out on their tour of inspection
it was a long business for formery examined every room with the most scrupulous more care indeed than he had displayed in his examination of the
in particular he lingered long in the bedroom of victoire discussing the possibilities of her having been murdered and carried away by the burglars along with their booty
he seemed if anything disappointed at finding no but to find real consolation in the thought that she might have been strangled
he found the inspector in entire agreement with every theory he enunciated and he grew more and more disposed to regard him as a zealous and trustworthy officer
also he was not at all displeased at enjoying this opportunity of impressing the duke with his powers of analysis and synthesis
he was unaware that as a rule the duke s eyes did not usually twinkle as they twinkled during this solemn and deliberate progress through the house of
formery had so exactly the air of a sleuthhound and he was even noisier
having made this thorough examination of the house formery went out into the garden and set about examining that
there were footprints on the turf about the foot of the ladder for the grass was and the rain had penetrated and softened the soil but there were hardly as many footprints as might have been expected seeing that the burglars must have made many journeys in the course of robbing the of so many objects of art some of them of considerable weight
the footprints led to a path of hard gravel and formery led the way down it out of the door in the wall at the bottom of the garden and into the space round the house which was being built
as formery had divined there was a heap or to be exact there were several heaps of plaster about the bottom of the scaffolding
unfortunately there were also hundreds of footprints
formery looked at them with longing eyes but he did not suggest that the inspector should hunt about for a set of footprints of the size of the one he had so carefully measured on the carpet
while they were examining the ground round the house a man came briskly down the stairs from the second floor of the house of
he was an man almost insignificant of between forty and fifty and of rather more than middle height
he had an ordinary rather shapeless mouth an ordinary nose an ordinary chin an ordinary forehead rather low and ordinary ears
he was wearing an ordinary by no means new
his clothes were the ordinary clothes of a fairly citizen and his boots had been chosen less to set off any slenderness his feet might possess than for their comfortable roominess
only his eyes relieved his face from insignificance
they were extraordinarily alert eyes producing in those on whom they rested the somewhat uncomfortable impression that the depths of their souls were being penetrated
he was the famous guerchard head of the detective department of the prefecture of police and sworn foe of ars√®ne lupin
the policeman at the door of the saluted him briskly
he was a fine upstanding young fellow adorned by a rich black moustache of extraordinary fierceness
shall i go and inform formery that you have come guerchard he said
no no there s no need to take the trouble said guerchard in a gentle rather husky voice
don t bother any one about m of no importance
oh come guerchard protested the policeman
of no importance said guerchard decisively
for the present formery is everything
he stepped into the and stood looking about it curiously still
it was almost as if the whole of his being was concentrated in the act of if all the other functions of his mind and body were in suspension
m formery and the inspector have just been up to examine the housekeeper s room
it s right at the top of the the second floor
you take the servants staircase
then it s right at the end of the passage on the left
would you like me to take you up to it sir said the policeman eagerly
thank you i know where it ve just come from it said guerchard gently
a grin of admiration widened the already wide mouth of the policeman and showed a row of very white teeth
he said you re cleverer than all the examining magistrates in paris put together
you ought not to say that my good fellow
i can t prevent you thinking it of course but you ought not to say it said guerchard with husky gentleness and the faintest smile played round the corners of his mouth
he walked slowly to the window and the policeman walked with him
have you noticed this sir said the policeman taking hold of the top of the ladder with a powerful hand
it s probable that the burglars came in and went away by this ladder
they have even left this on the said the policeman and he patted the with his other powerful hand
thank you thank you said guerchard
they don t think it s lupin s work at all said the policeman
they think that lupin s letter announcing the burglary and these signatures on the walls are only a ruse
is there any way i can help you sir said policeman
take up your post outside that door and admit no one but formery the inspector bonavent or dieusy without consulting me
shan t i admit the duke of charmerace
he s taking a great interest in this affair said the policeman
oh the duke of charmerace said guerchard
the policeman went to his post of responsibility a proud man
hardly had the door closed behind him when guerchard was all and eyes
he examined the ladder the gaps on the wall from which the pictures had been taken the signatures of ars√®ne lupin
the very next thing he did was to pick up the book which the duke had set on the top of the footprint again to preserve it and he measured pacing it the distance between the footprint and the window
the result of this measuring did not appear to cause him any satisfaction for he frowned measured the distance again and then stared out of the window with a perplexed air thinking hard
it was curious that when he concentrated himself on a process of reasoning his eves seemed to lose something of their sharp brightness and grew a little dim
at last he seemed to come to some conclusion
he turned away from the window drew a small from his pocket dropped on his hands and knees and began to examine the surface of the carpet with the most minute care
he examined a space of it nearly six feet square stopped and gazed round the room
his eyes rested on the fireplace which he could see under the bottom of the big tapestried which was raised on legs about a foot high fitted with big casters
his eyes filled with interest without rising he crawled quickly across the room peeped round the edge of the screen and rose smiling
he went on to the further and made the same careful examination of it again examining a part of the surface of the carpet with his
he came back to the window to which the ladder had been raised and examined very carefully the broken shutter
he whistled softly to himself lighted a cigarette and leant against the side of the window
he looked out of it with dull eyes which saw nothing the while his mind worked upon the facts he had discovered
he had stood there plunged in reflection for perhaps ten minutes when there came a sound of voices and footsteps on the stairs
he awoke from his absorption seemed to prick his ears then slipped a leg over the and disappeared from sight down the ladder
the door opened and in came formery the duke and the inspector
formery looked round the room with eyes which seemed to expect to meet a familiar sight then walked to the other and looked round that
he turned to the policeman who had stepped inside the and said sharply m guerchard is not here
i left him here said the policeman
he has gone down the ladder to examine that house they re building
he s just following in our tracks and doing all over again the work we ve already done
he might have saved himself the trouble
we could have told him all he wants to know
he very likely would not be satisfied till he had seen everything for himself
he may see something which we have missed said the duke
formery frowned and said sharply that s hardly likely
i don t think that your grace realizes to what a perfection constant practice brings one s power of observation
the inspector and i will cheerfully eat anything we ve t we inspector
and he laughed heartily at his joke
it might always prove a large mouthful said the duke with an ironical smile
formery assumed his air of profound reflection and walked a few steps up and down the room frowning the more i think about it he said the clearer it grows that we have disposed of the lupin theory
this is the work of far less expert rogues than lupin
yes i think you have disposed of that theory sir said the inspector with ready acquiescence
all the same i d wager anything that we haven t disposed of it to the satisfaction of guerchard said formery
then he must be very hard to satisfy said the duke
oh in any other matter he s open to reason said formery but lupin is his fixed idea it s an a mania
but yet he never catches him said the duke
his very obsession by lupin hampers him
it cramps his mind and hinders its working said formery
he resumed his meditative pacing stopped again and said but considering everything especially the absence of any traces of violence combined with her entire disappearance i have come to another conclusion
victoire is the key to the mystery
she unmade it to put us off the scent
that at any rate is something gained to have found the accomplice
we shall have this good news at least to tell m on his arrival
do you really think that she s the accomplice said the duke
i m dead sure of it said formery
we will go up to her room and make another thorough examination of it
guerchard s head popped up above the my dear formery he said i beg that you will not take the trouble
myself said guerchard and he came to the top of the ladder and slipped lightly over the into the room
he shook hands with formery and nodded to the inspector
then he looked at the duke with an air of inquiry
let me introduce you said formery
guerchard head of the detective duke of charmerace
the duke shook hands with guerchard saying i m delighted to make your acquaintance guerchard
i ve been expecting your coming with the greatest interest
indeed it was i who begged the officials at the prefecture of police to put this case in your hands
what were you doing on that ladder said formery giving guerchard no time to reply to the duke
i was listening said guerchard listening
i like to hear people talk when i m engaged on a case
i really must congratulate you my dear formery on the admirable manner in which you have conducted this inquiry
formery bowed and regarded him with a touch of suspicion
there are one or two minor points on which we do not agree but on the whole your method has been admirable said guerchard
well about victoire said formery
you re quite sure that an examination a more thorough examination of her room is unnecessary
i have just looked at it myself
the door opened and in came bonavent one of the detectives who had come earlier from the prefecture
in his hand he carried a scrap of cloth
he saluted guerchard and said to formery i have just found this scrap of cloth on the edge of the well at the bottom of the garden
the concierge s wife tells me that it has been torn from victoire s dress
i feared it said formery taking the scrap of cloth from him
we must go to the well at once send some one down it or have it dragged
he was moving hastily to the door when guerchard said in his husky gentle voice i don t think there is any need to look for victoire in the well
but this scrap of cloth said formery holding it out to him
yes yes that scrap of cloth said guerchard
and turning to the duke he added do you know if there s a dog or cat in the house your grace
i suppose that as the fiance of mademoiselle you are familiar with the house
excuse me interrupted guerchard
yes there is a cat said the duke
i ve seen a cat at the door of the concierge s rooms
it must have been that cat which took this scrap of cloth to the edge of the well said guerchard gravely
this is cried formery beginning to flush
here we re dealing with a most serious murder of you talk about cats
victoire has not been murdered said guerchard and his husky voice was gentler than ever only just audible
but we don t know know nothing of the kind said formery
then how do you explain her disappearance
if she had disappeared i shouldn t explain it said guerchard
but since she has disappeared cried formery in a tone of exasperation
you know nothing about it cried formery losing his temper
yes i do said guerchard with the same gentleness
come do you mean to say that you know where she is cried formery
do you mean to tell us straight out that you ve seen her cried formery
oh yes i ve seen her said guerchard
then he said gently it must have been between four and five minutes ago
but hang it all you haven t been out of this room
and you ve seen her cried formery
yes said guerchard raising his voice a little
well why the devil don t you tell us where she is
cried formery purple with exasperation
but you won t let me get a word out of my mouth protested guerchard with aggravating gentleness
cried formery and he sank gasping on to a chair
ah well she s here said guerchard
how did she get here said formery
formery sat upright almost beside himself glaring furiously at guerchard what do you stand there pulling all our legs for
he walked across the room to the fireplace pushed the chairs which stood bound together on the to one side of the fireplace and ran the heavy on its casters to the other side of it revealing to their gaze the wide fireplace itself
the iron brazier which held the coals had been moved into the corner and a mattress lay on the floor of the fireplace
on the mattress lay the figure of a big woman
there was a yellow gag in her mouth and her hands and feet were bound together with blue cords
she is sleeping soundly said guerchard
he stooped and picked up a handkerchief and smelt it
there s the handkerchief they chloroformed her with
they stared at him and the sleeping woman
the three of them raised the mattress and carried it and the sleeping woman to a broad couch and laid them on it
they staggered under their burden for truly victoire was a good weight
formery rose with recovered breath but with his face an even richer purple
his eyes were rolling in his head as if they were not under proper control
he turned on the inspector and cried savagely you never examined the fireplace inspector
no sir said the downcast inspector
how is one to work with subordinates like this
it was an oversight said guerchard
formery turned to him and said you must admit that it was materially impossible for me to see her
it was possible if you went down on all fours said guerchard
yes on all fours you could see her heels sticking out beyond the mattress said guerchard simply
formery shrugged his shoulders that screen looked as if it had stood there since the beginning of the summer he said
the first thing when you re dealing with lupin is to distrust appearances said guerchard
then he bit his lip and was silent
he walked to the side of the couch and looked down on the sleeping victoire frowning this upsets everything he said
with these new conditions i ve got to begin all over again to find a new explanation of the affair
for the the moment i m thrown completely off the track
oh well said guerchard i have an idea or two about the matter still
do you really mean to say that it hasn t thrown you off the track too said formery with a touch of incredulity in his tone
you were on the track of lupin said formery and his contemptuous smile was tinged with malice
the duke looked from one to the other of them with curious searching eyes i find all this so interesting he said
we do not take much notice of these checks they do not depress us for a moment said formery with some return of his old grandiloquence
we pause hardly for an instant then we begin to reconstruct
it s perfectly splendid of you said the duke and his limpid eyes rested on formery s face in a really affectionate gaze they might almost be said to caress it
guerchard looked out of the window at a man who was carrying a of bricks up one of the ladders set against the scaffolding of the building house
something in this honest workman s simple task seemed to amuse him for he smiled
only the inspector thinking of the unexamined fireplace looked really depressed
we shan t get anything out of this woman till she wakes said formery when she does i shall question her closely and fully
in the meantime she may as well be carried up to her bedroom to sleep off the effects of the chloroform
guerchard turned quickly not her own bedroom i think he said gently
certainly course not her own bedroom said formery quickly
and i think an officer at the door of whatever bedroom she does sleep in said guerchard
the inspector called in a couple of policemen and with their aid he and bonavent raised the sleeping woman a man at each corner of the mattress and bore her from the room
and now to reconstruct said formery and he folded his arms and plunged into profound reflection
the duke and guerchard watched him in silence
the family arrives in carrying out victoire the inspector had left the door of the open
after he had watched formery reflect for two minutes guerchard use an expressive it
the duke felt in the of his coat murmured softly my cigarettes and followed him
he caught up guerchard on the stairs and said i will come with you if i may guerchard
i find all these investigations extraordinarily interesting
i have been observing formery s should like to watch yours for a change
and there are several things i want to hear about from your grace
of course it might be an advantage to discuss them together with formery and he hesitated
it would be a pity to disturb formery in the middle of the process of reconstruction said the duke and a faint ironical smile played round the corners of his sensitive lips
guerchard looked at him quickly perhaps it would he said
they went through the house out of the back door and into the garden
guerchard moved about twenty yards from the house then he stopped and questioned the duke at great length
he questioned him first about the charolais their appearance their actions especially about bernard s attempt to steal the pendant and the theft of the
i have been wondering whether charolais might not have been ars√®ne lupin himself said the duke
it s quite possible said guerchard
there seem to be no limits whatever to lupin s powers of disguising himself
my colleague ganimard has come across him at least three times that he knows of as a different person
and no single time could he be sure that it was the same man
of course he had a feeling that he was in contact with some one he had met before but that was all
he may have met him half a dozen times besides without knowing him
and the photographs of re all different
ganimard declares that lupin is so extraordinarily successful in his disguises because he is a great actor
he actually becomes for the time being the person he pretends to be
he thinks and feels absolutely like that person
oh yes but he must be rather fluid this lupin said the duke and then he added thoughtfully it must be awfully risky to come so often into actual contact with men like ganimard and you
lupin has never let any consideration of danger prevent him doing anything that caught his fancy
he s a humourist of the most varied ironic farcical as the mood takes him
he must be awfully trying to live with said guerchard
do you think humourists are trying to live with said the duke in a meditative tone
i think they brighten life a good deal but of course there are people who do not like
yes yes they re all very well in their place but to live with they must be trying said guerchard quickly
he went on to question the duke closely and at length about the household of saying that ars√®ne lupin worked with the largest gang a burglar had ever captained and it was any odds that he had introduced one if not more of that gang into it
moreover in the case of a big affair like this lupin himself often played two or three parts under as many disguises
if he was charolais i don t see how he could be one of s household too said the duke in some perplexity
i don t say that he was charolais said guerchard
on the whole i m inclined to think that he was not
the theft of the was a job for a subordinate
he would hardly bother himself with it
the duke told him all that he could remember about the millionaire s under the clever questioning of the detective he was surprised to find how much he did kinds of odd details about them which he had scarcely been aware of observing
the two of them as they talked afforded an interesting contrast the duke with his air of distinction and race his ironic expression his mobile features his clear enunciation and voice his easy carriage of an accomplished fencer with muscles of to be a man of another kind from the detective with his husky voice his common slurring enunciation his clumsily moulded features so ill adapted to the expression of emotion and intelligence
it was a contrast almost between the hawk and the mole the warrior and the workman
only in their eyes were they alike both of them had the keen alert eyes of observers
perhaps the most curious thing of all was that in spite of the fact that he had for so much of his life been an idler trifling away his time in the pursuit of pleasure except when he had made his expedition to the south pole the duke gave one the impression of being a cleverer man of a far finer brain than the detective who had spent so much of his life sharpening his wits on the more intricate problems of crime
when guerchard came to the end of his questions the duke said you have given me a very strong feeling that it is going to be a deuce of a job to catch lupin
i don t wonder that so far you have none of you laid hands on him
once he had him in prison and actually brought him to trial
lupin became another man and was let go from the very dock
it sounds absolutely amazing said the duke
and then in the affair of the blue diamond ganimard caught him again
it s a very common weakness in these masters of crime
ganimard and holmlock shears in that affair got the better of him by using his love for a the lady she was nab him
shabby said guerchard in a tone of utter wonder
how can anything be shabby in the case of a rogue like this
perhaps said the duke and stopped
the expression of wonder faded from guerchard s face and he went on well holmlock shears recovered the blue diamond and ganimard nabbed lupin
he held him for ten minutes then lupin escaped
what became of the lady said the duke
i have heard that she is dead said guerchard
now i come to think of it i heard quite definitely that she died
it must be awful for a woman to love a man like constant wearing anxiety said the duke thoughtfully
yet he can have his pick of sweethearts
i ve been offered thousands of francs by of your grace s world and wealthy make them acquainted with lupin said guerchard
you don t surprise me said the duke with his ironic smile
women never do stop to one of their heroes is concerned
if i could find lupin entangled with a woman like ganimard said guerchard between his teeth
he d never get out of your clutches said the duke with conviction
i think think not said guerchard grimly
he walked across the turf to the foot of the ladder and looked at the footprints round it
he made but a cursory examination of them and took his way down the out of the door in the wall into the space about the house that was building
he was not long examining it and he went right through it out into the street on which the house would face when it was finished
he looked up and down it and began to retrace his footsteps
i ve seen all i want to see out here
we may as well go back to the house he said to the duke
i hope you ve seen what you expected to see said the duke
exactly what i expected to said guerchard
that s as it should be said the duke
they went back to the house and found formery in the still engaged in the process of reconstruction
the thing to do now is to hunt the neighbourhood for witnesses of the departure of the burglars with their booty
loaded as they were with such bulky objects they must have had a big conveyance
they must have wondered why it was standing in front of a house
somebody may have actually seen the burglars loading it though it was so early in the morning
bonavent had better inquire at every house in the street on which that house faces
did you happen to notice the name of it said formery
it s sureau street said guerchard
but dieusy has been hunting the neighbourhood for some one who saw the burglars loading their conveyance or saw it waiting to be loaded for the last hour
guerchard and the duke sat down and lighted cigarettes
you found plenty of traces said formery waving his hand towards the window
yes i ve found plenty of traces said guerchard
of lupin said formery with a faint sneer
a smile of warm satisfaction illumined formery s face what did i tell you
i m glad that you ve changed your mind about that
i have hardly changed my mind said guerchard in his husky gentle voice
there came a loud knocking on the front door the sound of excited voices on the stairs
he took one glance round the devastated room raised his clenched hands towards the ceiling and bellowed the scoundrels
and his voice stuck in his throat
he tottered across the room to a couch dropped heavily to it gazed round the scene of desolation and burst into tears
germaine and sonia came into the room
the duke stepped forward to greet them
you re as hoarse as a crow as it is said germaine impatiently
then turning on the duke with a frown she said i think that joke of yours about the train was simply disgraceful jacques
a joke s a joke but to send us out to the station on a night like last night through all that heavy rain when you knew all the time that there was no was simply disgraceful
i really don t know what you re talking about said the duke quietly
of course there wasn t said germaine
i think it was the most senseless attempt at a joke i ever heard of
it doesn t seem to me to be a joke at all said the duke quietly
at any rate it isn t the kind of a joke i would be detestable
i never thought to look at the date of the
i keep a box of cigarettes in that drawer and i have noticed the there
of course it may have been lying there for years
it was stupid of me not to look at the date
i was sure that his grace would not do anything so unkind as that said sonia
well all i can say is it was very stupid of you not to look at the date said germaine
rose to his feet and wailed in the most heartrending fashion my pictures
they were worth a hundred and fifty thousand francs
formery stepped forward with an air and said i am distressed distressed by your loss
i am formery examining magistrate
it is a tragedy tragedy groaned the millionaire
do not let it upset you too much
we shall find your shall find them
only give us time said formery in a tone of warm encouragement
the face of the millionaire brightened a little
and after all you have the consolation that the burglars did not get hold of the gem of your collection
they have not stolen the coronet of the princesse de lamballe said formery
they have not touched this safe
what has that got to do with it
growled the millionaire quickly
empty but your coronet cried the duke
then they have stolen it cried the millionaire hoarsely in a voice
but they can t safe hasn t been touched said the duke
but the coronet never was in that safe
it they entered my bedroom said the millionaire
they don t seem to have gone through any of the rooms except these two said the duke
ah then my mind is at rest about that
the safe in my bedroom has only two keys
he took a key from his waistcoat pocket and held it out to them
the face of formery was lighted up with a splendid satisfaction
he might have rescued the coronet with his own hands
he cried triumphantly there you see
see cried the millionaire in a sudden bellow
chapter xii the theft of the pendant
they stood round the millionaire observing his anguish with eyes in which shone various degrees of sympathy
as if no longer able to bear the sight of such woe sonia slipped out of the room
the millionaire lamented his loss and abused the thieves by turns but always at the top of his magnificent voice
suddenly a fresh idea struck him
he clapped his hand to his brow and cried that eight hundred pounds
charolais will never buy the mercrac now
he was not a bona fide purchaser
the duke s lips parted slightly and his eyes opened a trifle wider than their wont
he turned sharply on his heel and almost sprang into the other
formery kept saying to the millionaire be calm
we shall recover your masterpieces
his soothing remonstrances at last had their effect
the millionaire grew calm guerchard he said
formery presented guerchard to him
have you a clue said the millionaire
i think said formery in an impressive tone that we may now proceed with the inquiry in the ordinary way
he was a little piqued by the millionaire s so readily turning from him to the detective
he went to a set some sheets of paper before him and prepared to make notes on the answers to his questions
the duke came back into the the inspector was summoned
sat down on a couch with his hands on his knees and gazed gloomily at formery
germaine who was sitting on a couch near the door waiting with an air of resignation for her father to cease his lamentations rose and moved to a chair nearer the
guerchard kept moving restlessly about the room but noiselessly
at last he came to a standstill leaning against the wall behind formery
formery went over all the matters about which he had already questioned the duke
he questioned the millionaire and his daughter about the charolais the theft of the and the attempted theft of the pendant
he questioned them at less length about the composition of their servants and their characters
he paused and then he said carelessly as a mere matter of routine i should like to know if there has ever been any other robbery committed at your house
three years ago this scoundrel the millionaire began violently
yes yes i know all about that earlier burglary
but have you been robbed since said formery interrupting him
no i haven t been robbed since that burglary but my daughter has said the millionaire
yes i have been robbed two or three times during the last three years said germaine
but you ought to have told us about this before
this is extremely interesting and most important said formery rubbing his hands i suppose you suspect victoire
no i don t said germaine quickly
the last two thefts were committed at the ch√¢teau when victoire was in paris in charge of this house
formery seemed taken aback and he hesitated consulting his notes
never mind said formery solemnly
and turning to germaine he went on you say mademoiselle that these thefts began about three years ago
yes i think they began about three years ago in august
it was in the month of august three years ago that your father after receiving a threatening letter like the one he received last night was the victim of a burglary said formery
well it would be interesting to know which of your servants entered your service three years ago said formery
victoire has only been with us a year at the outside said germaine
only a year said formery quickly with an air of some vexation
and what was the nature of the last theft of which you were the victim
it was a pearl unlike the pendant which his grace gave me yesterday said germaine
would you mind showing me that pendant
i should like to see it said formery
you have it haven t you said germaine turning to the duke
how should i have it said the duke in some surprise
i ve only got the empty case said germaine with a startled air
the empty case said the duke with growing surprise
it was after we came back from our useless journey to the station
i remembered suddenly that i had started without the pendant
i went to the bureau and picked up the case and it was empty
didn t you catch this young bernard charolais with this case in his hands your grace
i caught him with it in his pocket
then you may depend upon it that the young rascal had slipped the pendant out of its case and you only recovered the empty case from him said formery triumphantly
nor could the thief have been the burglar who broke open the bureau to get at the keys
for long after both of them were out of the house i took a cigarette from the box which stood on the bureau beside the case which held the pendant
and it occurred to me that the young rascal might have played that very trick on me
i opened the case and the pendant was there
cried the millionaire of course it has been stolen
irma or perhaps mademoiselle kritchnoff has brought it to paris for germaine
sonia certainly hasn t brought it
it was she who suggested to me that you had seen it lying on the bureau and slipped it into your pocket said germaine quickly
then it must be irma said the duke
we had better send for her and make sure said formery
the inspector went out of the room and the duke questioned germaine and her father about the journey whether it had been very uncomfortable and if they were very tired by it
he learned that they had been so fortunate as to find sleeping compartments on the train so that they had suffered as little as might be from their night of travel
formery looked through his notes guerchard seemed to be going to sleep where he stood against the wall
the inspector came back with irma
she wore the frightened air which people of her class wear when confronted by the authorities
her big cow s eyes rolled uneasily
formery cut her short somewhat brusquely
i am conducting this inquiry he said
and then turning to irma he added now don t be frightened mademoiselle irma i want to ask you a question or two
have you brought up to paris the pendant which the duke of charmerace gave your mistress yesterday
i haven t brought the pendant said irma
yes sir i haven t seen the pendant
didn t mademoiselle germaine leave it on the bureau said irma
how do you know that said formery
i heard mademoiselle germaine say that it had been on the bureau
i thought that perhaps mademoiselle kritchnoff had put it in her bag
why should mademoiselle kritchnoff put it in her bag said the duke quickly
to bring it up to paris for mademoiselle germaine said irma
but what made you think that said guerchard suddenly intervening
oh i thought mademoiselle kritchnoff might have put it in her bag because i saw her standing by the bureau said irma
ah and the pendant was on the bureau said formery
suddenly the atmosphere of the room seemed to have become charged with an vague menace
guerchard seemed to have become wide awake again
germaine and the duke looked at one another uneasily
have you been long in the service of mademoiselle said formery
irma went quickly out of the room with an air of relief
formery scribbled a few words on the paper before him and then said well i will proceed to question mademoiselle kritchnoff
mademoiselle kritchnoff is quite above suspicion said the duke quickly
how long has mademoiselle kritchnoff been in your service mademoiselle said guerchard
let me think said germaine knitting her brow
can t you remember said formery
just about three years said germaine
that s exactly the time at which the thefts began said formery
ask mademoiselle kritchnoff to come here inspector said formery
i ll go and fetch know where to find her said the duke quickly moving toward the door
please please your grace protested guerchard
the duke turned sharply and looked at him i beg your pardon but do he said
please don t be annoyed your grace guerchard interrupted
but formery agrees with would be quite irregular
yes yes your grace said formery
we have our method of procedure
it is best to adhere to the best
it is the result of years of experience of the best way of getting the truth
just as you please said the duke shrugging his shoulders
the inspector came into the room mademoiselle kritchnoff will be here in a moment
you don t mean to say you re letting members of the household go out
i mean that she was just asking if she might go out
formery beckoned the inspector to him and said to him in a voice too low for the others to hear just slip up to her room and search her trunks
there is no need to take the trouble said guerchard in the same low voice but with sufficient emphasis
there s no need to take the trouble formery repeated after him
the door opened and sonia came in
she was still wearing her travelling costume and she carried her cloak on her arm
she stood looking round her with an air of some surprise perhaps there was even a touch of fear in it
the long journey of the night before did not seem to have dimmed at all her delicate beauty
the duke s eyes rested on her in an inquiring wondering even searching gaze
she looked at him and her own eyes fell
will you come a little nearer mademoiselle said formery
there are one or two will you allow me said guerchard in a tone of such deference that it left formery no grounds for refusal
formery flushed and ground his teeth
mademoiselle kritchnoff said guerchard in a tone of the most courtesy there is a matter on which formery needs some information
the pendant which the duke of charmerace gave mademoiselle yesterday has been stolen
are you sure said sonia in a tone of mingled surprise and anxiety
we have exactly determined the conditions under which the theft was committed
but we have every reason to believe that the culprit to avoid detection has hidden the pendant in the or trunk of somebody else in order my bag is upstairs in my bedroom sir sonia interrupted quickly
in order to free her hands to take the key from her she set her cloak on the back of a couch
it slipped off it and fell to the ground at the feet of the duke who had not returned to his place beside germaine
while she was groping in her bag for the key and all eyes were on her the duke who had watched her with a curious intentness ever since her entry into the room stooped quietly down and picked up the cloak
his hand slipped into the pocket of it his fingers touched a hard object wrapped in
they closed round it drew it from the pocket and sheltered by the cloak transferred it to his own
he set the cloak on the back of the sofa and very softly moved back to his place by germaine s side
no one in the room observed the movement not even guerchard he was watching sonia too intently
sonia found the key and held it out to guerchard
he shook his head and said there is no reason to search your whatever
she shrank back a little from his piercing eyes almost as if their gaze scared her
it s upstairs in my bedroom too open
she spoke in a faltering voice and her troubled eyes could not meet those of the detective
you were going out i think said guerchard gently
there is some shopping that must be done said sonia
you do not see any reason why mademoiselle kritchnoff should not go out formery do you said guerchard
oh no none whatever of course she can go out said formery
one moment said guerchard coming forward
i have my money and my handkerchief in it
guerchard s keen eyes darted into it and he muttered no point in looking in that
i don t suppose any one would have had the and he stopped
sonia made a couple of steps toward the door turned hesitated came back to the couch and picked up her cloak
there was a sudden gleam in guerchard s gleam of understanding expectation and triumph
he stepped forward and holding out his hands said allow me
some one may have have you felt in the pockets of it
it seems as if that he pointed to the pocket which had held the packet
sonia started back with an air of utter dismay her eyes glanced wildly round the room as if seeking an avenue of escape her fingers closed convulsively on the pocket
you look as i beg you mademoiselle interrupted guerchard
we are sometimes really mademoiselle sonia broke in the duke in a singularly clear and piercing tone i can not see why you should object to this mere formality
oh gasped sonia raising her eyes to his
the duke seemed to hold them with his own and he said in the same clear piercing voice there isn t the slightest reason for you to be frightened
sonia let go of the cloak and guerchard his face all alight with triumph plunged his hand into the pocket
he drew it out empty and stared at it while his face fell to an utter amazed blankness
and he stared at his empty hand as if he could not believe his eyes
by a violent effort he forced an apologetic smile on his face and said to sonia a thousand apologies mademoiselle
she took a step towards the door and tottered
the duke sprang forward and caught her as she was falling
thank you you just saved me in time muttered sonia
i m really very sorry said guerchard
i m all right now said sonia releasing herself from the duke s supporting arm
she drew herself up and walked quietly out of the room
guerchard went back to formery at the
you made a clumsy mistake there guerchard said formery with a touch of gratified malice in his tone
guerchard took no notice of it i want you to give orders that nobody leaves the house without my permission he said in a low voice
no one except mademoiselle kritchnoff i suppose said formery smiling
she less than any one said guerchard quickly
i don t understand what you re driving at a bit said formery
unless you suppose that mademoiselle kritchnoff is lupin in disguise
guerchard laughed softly you will have your joke formery he said
well well i ll give the order said formery somewhat mollified by the tribute to his humour
he called the inspector to him and whispered a word in his ear
then he rose and said i think gentlemen we ought to go and examine the bedrooms and above all make sure that the safe in s bedroom has not been tampered with
i was wondering how much longer we were going to waste time here talking about that stupid pendant grumbled the millionaire and he rose and led the way
there may also be some in the bedrooms said formery
there are all the wedding presents
they were in charge of victoire
it would be dreadful if they had been stolen
some of them are from the first families in france
they would replace them those said the duke smiling
germaine and her father led the way
formery guerchard and the inspector followed them
at the door the duke paused stopped closed it on them softly
he came back to the window put his hand in his pocket and drew out the packet wrapped in
he unfolded the paper with slow reluctant fingers and revealed the pendant
the duke stared at the pendant his eyes full of wonder and pity
he said softly under his breath
he put the pendant carefully away in his and stood staring thoughtfully out of the window
the door opened softly and sonia came quickly into the room closed the door and leaned back against it
her face was a dead white her skin had lost its lustre of fine porcelain and she stared at him with eyes dim with anguish
in a hoarse broken voice she muttered forgive me
a said the duke in a tone of pitying wonder
you mustn t stop here said the duke in an uneasy tone and he looked uneasily at the door
ah you don t want to speak to me any more said sonia in a heartrending tone wringing her hands
guerchard is suspicious of everything
it is dangerous for us to be talking here
i assure you that it s dangerous said the duke
what an opinion must you have of me
for goodness sake don t speak so loud said the duke with even greater uneasiness
i ve lost the liking of the only creature whose liking i wanted
we ll talk somewhere else presently
that ll be far safer said the duke
yesterday before me you gave her that pendant she smiled
and if i could i d take her fortune too
said sonia and her eyes no longer gentle glowed with the sombre resentment the dull rage of the weak who turn on fortune
her gentle voice was harsh with rebellious wrath
you hate her said the duke quickly
i should never have told you that
it s the avowal died on her lips
a burning flush crimsoned her cheeks and faded as quickly as it came i hate her
i know that you re thinking this is a very pretty story but it s not her first theft and it s s the tenth perhaps it s the twentieth
she paused and the glow deepened in her eyes
but there s one thing you must shall believe since you came since i ve known you since the first day you set eyes on me i have stolen no more till yesterday when you gave her the pendant before me
she paused and looked at him with eyes that demanded an assent
i believe you said the duke gravely
she heaved a deep sigh of relief and went on more of its golden tone had returned to her voice and then if you knew how it began
poor child said the duke softly
yes you pity me but you despise despise me beyond words
believe me no said the duke in a soothing tone
have you ever been in the world
in this big city where i was starving in sight of bread
one only had to stretch out one s hand to touch it
she broke off quite commonplace
go on tell me said the duke curtly
there was one way i could make money and i would not do it no i would not she went on
but that day i was dying understand i was dying
i went to the rooms of a man i knew a little
he gave me food and wine and then he talked to me
what cried the duke and a sudden flame of anger flared up in his eyes
i began to steal to remain an honest woman and i ve gone on stealing to keep up appearances
and she laughed the faint dreadful mocking laugh of a damned soul
she cried and burying her face in her hands she burst into a storm of weeping
and he stared gloomily on the ground overcome by this revelation of the tortures of the feeble in the underworld beneath the paris he knew
you do understand and feel said sonia between her sobs
the duke raised his head and gazed at her with eyes full of an infinite sympathy and compassion
poor little sonia he said gently
she gazed at him with incredulous eyes in which joy and despair mingled struggling
he came slowly towards her and stopped short
his quick ear had caught the sound of a footstep outside the door
he caught her hand and drew her swiftly into the further
with the quickness which came of long practice in hiding her feelings sonia composed her face to something of its usual gentle calm
there was even a faint tinge of colour in her cheeks they had lost their dead whiteness
a faint light shone in her eyes the anguish had cleared from them
they rested on the duke with a look of ineffable gratitude
the duke went to the window and lighted a cigarette
they heard the door of the outer open and there was a pause
quick footsteps crossed the room and guerchard stood in the doorway
he looked from one to the other with keen and eager eyes
sonia sat staring rather listlessly at the carpet
the duke turned and smiled at him
i hope the burglars have not stolen the coronet
the coronet is safe your grace said guerchard
the said guerchard with an inquiring air
the wedding presents said the duke
yes your grace the wedding presents are safe said guerchard
i breathe again said the duke languidly
guerchard turned to sonia and said i was looking for you mademoiselle to tell you that formery has changed his mind
it is impossible for you to go out
no one will be allowed to go out
yes said sonia in an indifferent tone
we should be very much obliged if you would go to your room said guerchard
your meals will be sent up to you
what said sonia rising quickly and she looked from guerchard to the duke
the duke gave her the faintest nod
very well i will go to my room she said coldly
they accompanied her to the door of the outer
guerchard opened it for her and closed it after her
really guerchard said the duke shrugging his shoulders
really i m very sorry your grace but it s my trade or if you prefer it my duty
as long as things are taking place here which i am still the only one to perceive and which are not yet clear to me i must neglect no precaution
of course you know best said the duke
but still a child like re frightening her out of her guerchard shrugged his shoulders and went quietly out of the room
the duke sat down in an easy chair frowning and thoughtful
suddenly there struck on his ears the sound of a loud roaring and heavy bumping on the stairs the door flew open and stood on the threshold waving a telegram in his hand
formery and the inspector came hurrying down the stairs behind him and watched his emotion with astonished and wondering eyes
a telegram from the scoundrel himself
just listen a thousand apologies for not having been able to keep my promise about the coronet
had an appointment at the acacias
please have coronet ready in your room
will come without fail to fetch it between a quarter to twelve and twelve o clock
yours affectionately ars√®ne lupin
if you ask me i think he s humbug said the duke with conviction
you thought the letter was humbug and look what has happened cried the millionaire
give me the telegram please said formery quickly
the millionaire gave it to him and he read it through
find out who brought it inspector he said
the inspector hurried to the top of the staircase and called to the policeman in charge of the front door
he came back to the and said it was brought by an ordinary messenger sir
shall i send for him sir said the inspector
no no it doesn t matter said formery and turning to and the duke he said now we re really going to have trouble with guerchard
he is going to muddle up everything
this telegram will be the last straw
nothing will persuade him now that this is not lupin s work
and just consider gentlemen if lupin had come last night and if he had really set his heart on the coronet he would have stolen it then or at any rate he would have tried to open the safe in s bedroom in which the coronet actually is or this safe here went to the safe and rapped on the door of in which is the second key
that s quite clear said the inspector
if then he did not make the attempt last night when he had a clear the house was certainly will not make the attempt now when we are warned when the police are on the spot and the house is surrounded
the idea is childish gentlemen leaned against the door of the absolutely childish but guerchard is mad on this point and i foresee that his madness is going to hamper us in the most idiotic way
he suddenly pitched forward into the middle of the room as the door of the safe opened with a jerk and guerchard shot out of it
what the devil cried formery gaping at him
you d be surprised how clearly you hear everything in these d think they were too thick said guerchard in his gentle husky voice
how on earth did you get into it cried formery
it s the getting out that was awkward
these jokers had fixed up some kind of a spring so that i nearly shot out with the door said guerchard rubbing his elbow
how the deuce did you get into it cried formery
through the little cabinet into which that door behind the safe opens
there s no longer any back to the safe they ve cut it clean out of very neat piece of work
safes like this should always be fixed against a wall not stuck in front of a door
the backs of them are always the weak point
the key of the safe upstairs in my bedroom where the coronet the key there
guerchard went back into the empty safe and groped about in it
well have you found the key cried the millionaire
i haven t but i ve found something better said guerchard
what is it said formery sharply
i ll give you a hundred guesses said guerchard with a tantalizing smile
a little present for you said guerchard
what do you mean cried formery angrily
guerchard held up a card between his thumb and forefinger and said quietly the card of ars√®ne lupin
chapter xiv guerchard picks up the true scent the millionaire gazed at the card with stupefied eyes the inspector gazed at it with extreme intelligence the duke gazed at it with interest and formery gazed at it with extreme disgust
it s part of the same was put there to throw us off the scent
it proves nothing he said scornfully
no it proves nothing at all said guerchard quietly
the telegram is the important telegram said feverishly
oh no no said formery in a soothing tone
it will certainly be taken into account
s butler appeared in the doorway of the if you please sir lunch is served he said
at the tidings some of his weight of woe appeared to be lifted from the head of the millionaire
gentlemen you will lunch with me i hope
there is nothing else for us to do at any rate at present and in the house
i am not quite satisfied about mademoiselle least guerchard is not
i propose to question her those earlier thefts
i m sure there s nothing in that said the duke quickly
no no i don t think there is said formery
but still one never knows from what quarter light may come in an affair like this
accident often gives us our best clues
it seems rather a shame to frighten s such a child said the duke
oh i shall be gentle your gentle as possible that is
but i look to get more from the examination of victoire
she has actually seen the rogues at work but till she recovers there is nothing more to be done except to wait the discoveries of the detectives who are working outside and they will report here
so in the meantime we shall be charmed to lunch with you
they went downstairs to the and found an elaborate and luxurious lunch worthy of the hospitality of a millionaire awaiting them
the skill of the cook seemed to have been quite unaffected by the losses of his master
formery an ardent lover of good things enjoyed himself immensely
germaine a little upset by the was rather querulous
her father was plunged in a gloom which lifted for but a brief space at the appearance of a fresh delicacy
guerchard ate and drank seriously answering the questions of the duke in a somewhat fashion
the duke himself seemed to have lost his usual flow of good spirits and at times his brow was knitted in an anxious frown
his questions to guerchard showed a far less keen interest in the affair
to him the lunch seemed very long and very tedious but at last it came to an end
seemed to have been much cheered by the wine he had drunk
formery who had not by any means trifled with the champagne was raised to the very height of sanguine certainty
their coffee and liqueurs were served in the
guerchard lighted a cigar refused a liqueur drank his coffee quickly and slipped out of the room
the duke followed him and in the hall said i will continue to watch you unravel the threads of this mystery if i may guerchard
good republican as guerchard was he could not help feeling flattered by the interest of a duke and the excellent lunch he had eaten disposed him to feel the honour even more deeply
to tell the truth i find the company of your grace really quite stimulating
it must be because i find it all so extremely interesting said the duke
they went up to the and found the young policeman seated on a chair by the door eating a lunch which had been sent up to him from the millionaire s kitchen with a very hearty appetite
guerchard shut the door and turned the key now he said i think that formery will give me half an hour to myself
his cigar ought to last him at least half an hour
in that time i shall know what the burglars really did with their least i shall know for certain how they got it out of the house
i thought we knew how they got it out of the house
and he waved his hand towards the window
oh that s childish said guerchard contemptuously
those are traces for an examining magistrate
the ladder the table on the they lead nowhere
the only people who came up that ladder were the two men who brought it from the scaffolding
it was mere waste of time to bother with those traces
but the footprint under the book said the duke
one of the burglars sat on the couch there rubbed plaster on the sole of his boot and set his foot down on the carpet
then he dusted the rest of the plaster off his boot and put the book on the top of the footprint
now how do you know that said the astonished duke
it s as plain as a said guerchard
there must have been several burglars to move such pieces of furniture
if the soles of all of them had been covered with plaster all the sweeping in the world would not have cleared the carpet of the tiny fragments of it
i ve been over the carpet between the footprint and the window with a magnifying glass
there are no fragments of plaster on it
it is a mere blind and a very fair blind an examining magistrate
that narrows the problem the quite simple problem how was the furniture taken out of the room
it did not go through that window down the ladder
again it was not taken down the stairs and out of the front door or the back
if it had been the concierge and his wife would have heard the noise
besides that it would have been carried down into a main street in which there are people at all hours
somebody would have been sure to tell a policeman that this house was being emptied
moreover the police were continually patrolling the main streets and quickly as a man like lupin would do the job he could not do it so quickly that a policeman would not have seen it
no the furniture was not taken down the stairs or out of the front door
that narrows the problem still more
in fact there is only one mode of egress left
you ve hit it said guerchard with a husky laugh
by that logical process the process of elimination we ve excluded all methods of egress except the chimney
he paused frowning in some perplexity and then he said uneasily what i don t like about it is that victoire was set in the fireplace
i asked myself at once what was she doing there
it was unnecessary that she should be drugged and set in the unnecessary
it might have been to put off an examining magistrate said the duke
having found victoire in the fireplace formery did not look for anything else
yes it might have been that said guerchard slowly
on the other hand she might have been put there to make sure that i did not miss the road the burglars took
that s the worst of having to do with lupin
he knows me to the bottom of my mind
he has something up his surprise for me
even now i m nowhere near the bottom of the mystery
but come along we ll take the road the burglars took
the inspector has put my lantern ready for me
as he spoke he went to the fireplace picked up a lantern which had been set on the top of the iron and lighted it
the duke stepped into the great fireplace beside him
it was four feet deep and between eight and nine feet broad
guerchard threw the light from the lantern on to the back wall of it
six feet from the floor the soot from the fire stopped abruptly and there was a dappled patch of bricks half of them clean and red half of them blackened by soot five feet broad and four feet high
the opening is higher up than i thought said guerchard
he went to the door of the and bade the young policeman fetch him a pair of steps
he took them from the policeman shut the door and locked it again
he set the steps in the fireplace and mounted them
be careful he said to the duke who had followed him into the fireplace and stood at the foot of the steps
some of these bricks may drop inside and they ll sting you up if they fall on your toes
the duke stepped back out of reach of any bricks that might fall
guerchard set his left hand against the wall of the between him and the and pressed hard with his right against the top of the dappled patch of bricks
at the first push half a dozen of them fell with a bang on to the floor of the next house
the light came flooding in through the hole and shone on guerchard s face and its smile of satisfaction
quickly he pushed row after row of bricks into the next house until he had cleared an opening four feet square
come along he said to the duke and disappeared feet foremost through the opening
the duke mounted the steps and found himself looking into a large empty room of the exact size and shape of the of save that it had an ordinary modern fireplace instead of one of the antique pattern of that in which he stood
its was a few inches below the opening
he stepped out on to the and dropped lightly to the floor
well he said looking back at the opening through which he had come
oh it s common enough said guerchard
robberies at the big jewellers are sometimes worked by these means
but what is uncommon about it and what at first sight put me off the track is that these burglars had the cheek to pierce the wall with an opening large enough to enable them to remove the furniture of a house
the opening s as large as a window
those burglars seem capable of of a piece of mason s work
oh this has all been prepared a long while ago
but now i m really on their track
and after all i haven t really lost any time
dieusy wasted no time in making inquiries in sureau street he s been working all this side of the house
guerchard drew up the blinds opened the shutters and let the daylight flood the dim room
he came back to the fireplace and looked down at the heap of bricks frowning i made a mistake there he said
i ought to have taken those bricks down carefully one by one
quickly he took brick after brick from the pile and began to range them neatly against the wall on the left
the duke watched him for two or three minutes then began to help him
it did not take them long and under one of the last few bricks guerchard found a fragment of a gilded
here s where they ought to have done their sweeping he said holding it up to the duke
i tell you what said the duke i shouldn t wonder if we found the furniture in this house still
i tell you that lupin would allow for myself or ganimard being put in charge of the case and he would know that we should find the opening in the chimney
the furniture was taken straight out into the on to which this house opens
he led the way out of the room on to the landing and went down the dark staircase into the hall
he opened the shutters of the hall windows and let in the light
the dust lay thick on the tiled floor
down the middle of it was a lane formed by many feet
the footprints were faint but still plain in the layer of dust
guerchard came back to the stairs and began to examine them
up the flight he stooped and picked up a little spray of flowers fresh
these have not been long plucked
salvias they are said guerchard
pink salvias and there is only one gardener in france who has ever succeeded in getting this s gardener at charmerace
well then last night s burglars came from charmerace
it looks like it said guerchard
this is only we could get an absolute proof
we shall get one presently said guerchard confidently
it is interesting said the duke in a tone of lively enthusiasm
these tracks which cross one fact by degrees falling into its proper interesting
he paused and took out his will you have a cigarette he said
are they caporal said guerchard
thank you said guerchard and he took one
the duke struck a match lighted guerchard s cigarette and then his own
yes it s very interesting he said
in the last quarter of an hour you ve practically discovered that the burglars came from they were the they came in by the front door of this house and carried the furniture out of it
i don t know about their coming in by it said guerchard
unless i m very much mistaken they came in by the front door of s house
they brought the keys from charmerace
yes but who drew the bolts for them said guerchard
the concierge bolted them before he went to bed
he was telling the know when that kind of man is telling the truth
you mean that they had an accomplice
i think we shall find that they had an accomplice
but your grace is beginning to draw inferences with uncommon quickness
i believe that you would make a detective practice of practice
can i have missed my true career said the duke smiling
it s certainly a very interesting game
well i m not going to search this barracks myself said guerchard
i ll send in a couple of men to do it but i ll just take a look at the steps myself
so saying he opened the front door and went out and examined the steps carefully
we shall have to go back the way we came he said when he had finished his examination
we ought to find formery hammering on it
and he smiled as if he found the thought pleasing
they went back up the stairs through the opening into the of s house
sure enough from the other side of the locked door came the excited voice of formery crying guerchard
guerchard unlocked the door and in bounced formery very excited very red in the face
what on earth have you been doing
why didn t you open the door when i knocked
i didn t hear you said guerchard
then where on earth have you been cried formery
guerchard looked at him with a faint ironical smile and said in his gentle voice i was following the real track of the burglars
the examination of sonia formery gasped the real track
and he led him to the fireplace and showed him the opening between the two houses
cried formery in wild excitement
without more ado he began to mount the steps
the duke saw their heels disappear up the steps
then he came out of the and inquired for
he was told that the millionaire was up in his bedroom and he went upstairs and knocked at the door of it
bade him enter in a very faint voice and the duke found him lying on the bed
he was looking depressed even exhausted the shadow of the blusterous of the day before
the rich rosiness of his cheeks had faded to a moderate
that telegram moaned the millionaire
what already said the duke in a tone of the liveliest surprise
no no it s still in the safe said the millionaire
but it s as good as midnight it will be lost
if it s in this safe now it won t be lost before midnight said the duke
but are you sure it s there now
look for yourself said the millionaire taking the key of the safe from his waistcoat pocket and handing it to the duke
the morocco case which held the coronet lay on the middle shell in front of him
he glanced at the millionaire and saw that he had closed his eyes in the exhaustion of despair
whistling softly the duke opened the case took out the diadem and examined it carefully admiring its admirable workmanship
he put it back in the case turned to the millionaire and said thoughtfully i can never make up my mind in the case of one of these old diadems whether one ought not to take out the stones and have them
it s a very fine stone but this cutting does not really do it justice
oh no no you should never interfere with an antique historic piece of jewellery
any alteration decreases its value as an historic relic cried the millionaire in a shocked tone
i know that said the duke but the question for me is whether one ought not to sacrifice some of its value to increasing its beauty
you do have such mad ideas said the millionaire in a tone of peevish exasperation
ah well it s a nice question said the duke
he snapped the case briskly put it back on the shelf locked the safe and handed the key to the millionaire
then he strolled across the room and looked down into the street whistling softly
i ll go home and get out of these motoring clothes
and i should like to have on a pair of boots that were a trifle less muddy he said slowly
sat up with a jerk and cried for heaven s sake don t you go and desert me my dear chap
you don t know what my nerves are like
oh you ve got that guerchard and the splendid formery and four other detectives and half a dozen ordinary policemen guarding you
you can do without my feeble arm
besides i shan t be gone more than half an at the outside
i ll bring back my evening clothes with me and dress for dinner here
i don t suppose that anything fresh will happen between now and midnight but i want to be on the spot and hear the information as it comes in fresh
i positively cling to guerchard
it s an education though perhaps not a liberal education to go about with him said the duke and there was a irony in his voice
well if you must you must said grumpily
for the present then said the duke
and he went out of the room and down the stairs
he took his from the and had his hand on the latch of the door when the policeman in charge of it said i beg your pardon sir but have you guerchard s permission to leave the house
m guerchard s permission said the duke haughtily
what has guerchard to do with me
it was formery s orders your grace stammered the policeman doubtfully
m formery s orders said the duke standing on the top step
the concierge who stood beside the policeman ran down the steps and blew his whistle
the policeman gazed uneasily at the duke shifting his weight from one foot to the other but he said no more
a came up to the door the duke went down the steps stepped into it and drove away
of an hour later he came back having changed into clothes more suited to a paris
he went up to the and there he found guerchard formery and the inspector who had just completed their tour of inspection of the house next door and had satisfied themselves that the stolen treasures were not in it
the inspector and his men had searched it thoroughly just to make sure but as guerchard had foretold the burglars had not taken the chance of the failure of the police to discover the opening between the two houses
formery told the duke about their tour of inspection at length
guerchard went to the telephone and told the exchange to put him through to charmerace
he was informed that the trunk line was very busy and that he might have to wait half an hour
the duke inquired if any trace of the burglars after they had left with their booty had yet been found
formery told him that so far the detectives had failed to find a single trace
guerchard said that he had three men at work on the search and that he was hopeful of getting some news before long
the layman is impatient in these matters said formery with an indulgent smile
but we have learnt to be patient after long experience
he proceeded to discuss with guerchard the new theories with which the discovery of the afternoon had filled his mind
none of them struck the duke as being of great value and he listened to them with a somewhat air
the coming examination of sonia weighed heavily on his spirit
guerchard answered only in monosyllables to the questions and suggestions thrown out by formery
it seemed to the duke that he paid very little attention to him that his mind was still working hard on the solution of the mystery seeking the missing facts which would bring him to the bottom of it
in the middle of one of formery s more elaborate dissertations the telephone bell rang
guerchard rose hastily and went to it
they heard him say is that charmerace
tell him to ring me up at s house in paris the moment he gets back
he turned to them with a frown and said of course since i want him the confounded gardener has gone out for the day
still it s of very little mere corroboration i wanted
and he went back to his seat and lighted another cigarette
formery continued his dissertation
presently guerchard said you might go and see how victoire is she shows any signs of waking
the doctor said that she would not really be sensible and have her full wits about her much before ten o clock said the inspector but he went to examine her present condition
formery proceeded to discuss the effects of different anesthetics
the others heard him with very little attention
the inspector came back and reported that victoire showed no signs of awaking
well then formery i think we might get on with the examination of mademoiselle kritchnoff said guerchard
will you go and fetch her inspector
really i can not conceive why you should worry that poor child the duke protested in a tone of some indignation
it seems to me hardly necessary said formery
excuse me said guerchard suavely but i attach considerable importance to it
it seems to me to be our bounden duty to question her fully
one never knows from what quarter light may come
oh well since you make such a point of it said formery
inspector ask mademoiselle kritchnoff to come here
guerchard looked at the duke with a faint air of uneasiness i think that we had better question mademoiselle kritchnoff by ourselves he said
formery looked at him and hesitated
then he said oh yes of course by ourselves
certainly said the duke a trifle haughtily
and he rose and opened the door
he was just going through it when guerchard said sharply your
the duke paid no attention to him
he shut the door quickly behind him and sprang swiftly up the stairs
he met the inspector coming down with sonia
barring their way for a moment he said in his kindliest voice now you mustn t be frightened mademoiselle sonia
all you have to do is to try to remember as clearly as you can the circumstances of the earlier thefts at charmerace
you mustn t let them confuse you
thank you your grace i will try and be as clear as i can said sonia and she gave him an eloquent glance full of gratitude for the warning and went down the stairs with firm steps
the duke went on up the stairs and knocked softly at the door of s bedroom
there was no answer to his knock and he quietly opened the door and looked in
overcome by his misfortunes the millionaire had sunk into a profound sleep and was snoring softly
the duke stepped inside the room left the door open a couple of inches drew a chair to it and sat down watching the staircase through the opening of the door
he sat frowning with a look of profound pity on his face
once the suspense grew too much for him
he rose and walked up and down the room
his calm seemed to have deserted him
he muttered curses on guerchard formery and the whole french criminal system very softly under his breath
his face was distorted to a mask of fury and once he wiped the little beads of sweat from his forehead with his handkerchief
then he recovered himself sat down in the chair and resumed his watch on the stairs
at last at the end of half an hour which had seemed to him months long he heard voices
the door shut and there were footsteps on the stairs
the inspector and sonia came into view
he waited till they were at the top of the stairs then he came out of the room with his most careless air and said well mademoiselle sonia i hope you did not find it so very dreadful after all
she was very pale and there were undried tears on her cheeks
it was horrible she said faintly
formery was all believed me but that horrible detective would not believe a word i said
i hardly knew what i was saying
the duke ground his teeth softly
you had better lie down and rest
i will tell one of the servants to bring you up a glass of wine
he walked with her to the door of her room and said try to away the unpleasant memory
she went into her room and the duke went downstairs and told the butler to take a glass of champagne up to her
formery was at the table writing
he handed what he had written to guerchard and with a smile of satisfaction guerchard folded the paper and put it in his pocket
well formery did mademoiselle kritchnoff throw any fresh light on this mystery said the duke in a tone of faint contempt
fact she convinced me that she knew nothing whatever about it
guerchard seems to entertain a different opinion
but i think that even he is convinced that mademoiselle kritchnoff is not a friend of ars√®ne lupin
but there s no telling said guerchard slowly
surely you never thought that mademoiselle kritchnoff had anything to do with ars√®ne lupin
i never thought so said formery
he shrugged his shoulders and looked at guerchard with contemptuous eyes
the duke laughed an unaffected ringing laugh but not a pleasant one it s absurd
there are always those thefts said guerchard with a nettled air
you have nothing to go upon said formery
what if she did enter the service of mademoiselle just before the thefts began
besides after this lapse of time if she had committed the thefts you d find it a job to bring them home to her
it s not a job worth your doing s a job for an ordinary detective guerchard
there s always the pendant said guerchard
i am convinced that that pendant is in the house
i wish i d never given it to mademoiselle said the duke lightly
i have a feeling that if i could lay my hand on that i could find who has it i should have the key to this mystery
the devil you would said the duke softly
it is the oddest thing about this business i ve heard yet
i have that have that feeling said guerchard quietly
victoire s slip they were silent
the duke walked to the fireplace stepped into it and studied the opening
he came out again and said oh by the way formery the policeman at the front door wanted to stop me going out of the house when i went home to change
i take it that guerchard s prohibition does not apply to me
of course course not your grace said formery quickly
i saw that you had changed your clothes your grace said guerchard
i thought that you had done it here
the policeman protested but he went no further so i did not throw him into the middle of the whatever our station we should respect the law said formery solemnly
i am a royalist said the duke smiling at him
i was wondering said the duke about guerchard s theory that the burglars were let in the front door of this house by an accomplice
why when they had this beautiful large opening did they want a front door too
i did not know that that was guerchard s theory said formery a trifle contemptuously
of course they had no need to use the front door
perhaps they had no need to use the front door said guerchard but after all the front door was unbolted and they did not draw the bolts to put us off the scent
their false scent was already prepared waved his hand towards the moreover you must bear in mind that that opening might not have been made when they entered the house
suppose that while they were on the other side of the wall a brick had fallen on to the hearth and alarmed the concierge
we don t know how skilful they are they might not have cared to risk it
i m inclined to think on the whole that they did come in through the front door
perhaps you re right said the duke
i think we shall know more about the accomplice when victoire awakes said guerchard
the family have such confidence in victoire said the duke
perhaps lupin has too said guerchard grimly
always lupin said formery contemptuously
there came a knock at the door and a footman appeared on the threshold
he informed the duke that germaine had returned from her shopping expedition and was awaiting him in her boudoir
he went to her and tried to persuade her to put in a word for sonia and endeavour to soften guerchard s rigour
she refused to do anything of the kind declaring that in view of the value of the stolen property no stone must be left unturned to recover it
the police knew what they were doing they must have a free hand
the duke did not press her with any great vigour he realized the futility of an appeal to a nature so shallow so and so lacking in sympathy
he took his revenge by teasing her about the wedding presents which were still flowing in
her father s business friends were still striving to outdo one another in the costliness of the jewelry they were giving her
the great houses of the faubourg were still refraining firmly from anything that savoured of extravagance or ostentation
while he was with her the eleventh his mother s friend the duchess of veaul√©glise
the duke was overwhelmed with joy at the sight of it and his delighted comments drove germaine to the last extremity of exasperation
the result was that she begged him with petulant asperity to get out of her sight
he complied with her request almost with alacrity and returned to formery and guerchard
he found them at a standstill waiting for reports from the detectives who were hunting outside the house for information about the movements of the burglars with the stolen booty and apparently finding none
the police were also hunting for the stolen not only in paris and its environs but also all along the road between paris and charmerace
at about five o clock guerchard grew tired of the inaction and went out himself to assist his subordinates leaving formery in charge of the house itself
he promised to be back by seven to let the examining magistrate who had an engagement for the evening get away
the duke spent his time between the where formery entertained him with anecdotes of his professional skill and the boudoir where germaine was entertaining envious young friends who came to see her wedding presents
the friends of germaine were always a little ill at ease in the society of the duke belonging as they did to that wealthy middle class which has made france what she is
his indifference to the doings of the old friends of his family saddened them and they were unable to understand his airy and persistent trifling
it seemed to them a discord in the cosmic tune
the afternoon wore away and at seven guerchard had not returned
formery waited for him fuming for ten minutes then left the house in charge of the inspector and went off to his engagement
was entertaining two financiers and their wives two of their daughters and two friends of the duke the baron de vernan and the comte de vauvineuse at dinner that night
thanks to the duke the party was of a liveliness to which the gorgeous had been very little used since it had been so fortunate as to become the property of
the millionaire had been looking forward to an evening of luxurious woe deploring the loss of his their his sympathetic friends
the duke had other views and they prevailed
after dinner the guests went to the since the were in possession of guerchard
soon after ten the duke slipped away from them and went to the detective
guerchard s was not a face at any time full of expression and all that the duke saw on it was a subdued dulness
well guerchard he said cheerfully what luck
have any of your men come across any traces of the passage of the burglars with their booty
no your grace so far all the luck has been with the burglars
for all that any one seems to have seen them they might have vanished into the bowels of the earth through the floor of the cellars in the empty house next door
that means that they were very quick loading whatever vehicle they used with their plunder
i should think myself that they first carried everything from this house down into the hall of the house next door and then of course they could be very quick getting them from hall to their van or whatever it was
but still some one saw that it drive up to the house or waiting at the house or driving away from it
is formery coming back said the duke
the affair is in my hands now and i have my own men on of some intelligence or at any rate men who know my ways and how i want things done
it must be a relief said the duke
oh no i m used to all the examining magistrates in paris and in most of the big provincial towns
they do not really hamper me and often i get an idea from them for some of them are men of real intelligence
and others are not i understand said the duke
the door opened and bonavent the detective came in
the housekeeper s awake guerchard he said
good bring her down here said guerchard
perhaps you d like me to go said the duke
if it would interest you to hear me question her please stay
the duke sat down in an easy chair and guerchard stood before the fireplace
m formery told me when you were out this afternoon that he believed this housekeeper to be quite innocent said the duke idly
there is certainly one innocent in this affair said guerchard grinning
the examining magistrate said guerchard
the door opened and bonavent brought victoire in
she was a big woman with a pleasant cheerful ruddy face with sparkling brown eyes which did not seem to have been at all dimmed by her long drugged sleep
she looked like a farmer s wife a buxom managing woman
as soon as she came into the room she said quickly i wish mr inspector your man would have given me time to put on a decent dress
i must have been sleeping in this one ever since those rascals tied me up and put that smelly handkerchief over my face
i never saw such a crew as they were in my life
how many were there madame victoire said guerchard
the house was just swarming with them
i heard the noise i came downstairs and on the landing outside the door here one of them jumped on me from behind and nearly choked prevent me from screaming i suppose
and they were a crew were they said guerchard
i should know them again if i had but they were all masked said victoire
there s no need to tire you said guerchard
and she sat down on a chair facing him
let s see you sleep in one of the top rooms madame victoire
it has a dormer window set in the roof hasn t it said guerchard in the same polite pleasant voice
but what has that got to do with it said victoire
please answer my questions said guerchard sharply
did you hear any noise on the roof
how should i hear it on the roof
there wouldn t be any noise on the roof said victoire
you heard nothing on the roof said guerchard
no the noise i heard was down here said victoire
yes and you came down to see what was making it
and you were seized from behind on the landing and brought in here said guerchard
yes that s right said madame victoire
and were you tied up and gagged on the landing or in here said guerchard
oh i was caught on the landing and pushed in here and then tied up said victoire
i m sure that wasn t one man s job said guerchard looking at her vigorous figure with admiring eyes
you may be sure of that said victoire
it took four of them and at least two of them have some nice bruises on their shins to show for it
and it serves them jolly well right said guerchard in a tone of warm approval
and i suppose while those four were tying you up the others stood round and looked on
oh no they were far too busy for that said victoire
what were they doing said guerchard
they were taking the pictures off the walls and carrying them out of the window down the ladder said victoire
guerchard s eyes flickered towards the duke but the expression of earnest inquiry on his face never changed
now tell me did the man who took a picture from the walls carry it down the ladder himself or did he hand it through the window to a man who was standing on the top of a ladder ready to receive it he said
victoire paused as if to recall their action then she said oh he got through the window and carried it down the ladder himself
you re sure of that said guerchard
oh yes i am quite sure of should i deceive you mr inspector said victoire quickly and the duke saw the first shadow of uneasiness on her face
oh they put me behind the screen
no no where were you when you came into the room
i was against the door said victoire
and where was the screen said guerchard
no it was on one side said victoire
oh will you show me exactly where it stood said guerchard
victoire rose and guerchard aiding her set the screen on the side of the fireplace
guerchard stepped back and looked at it
now this is very important he said
i must have the exact position of the four feet of that screen
you do some dressmaking don t you madame victoire
oh yes i sometimes make a dress for one of the maids in my spare time said victoire
then you ve got a piece of chalk on you said guerchard
oh yes said victoire putting her hand to the pocket of her dress
she paused took a step backwards and looked wildly round the room while the colour slowly faded in her ruddy cheeks
she said in an uncertain shaky voice
i haven t any out of chalk the day before yesterday
i think you have madame victoire
feel in your pocket and see said guerchard sternly
his voice had lost its suavity his face its smile his eyes had grown dangerous
no no i have no chalk cried victoire
with a sudden leap guerchard sprang upon her caught her in a firm grip with his right arm and his left hand plunged into her pocket
guerchard loosed her and stepped back
what s this he said and he held up between his thumb and forefinger a piece of blue chalk
victoire drew herself up and faced him gallantly well what of it is chalk
mayn t an honest woman carry chalk in her pockets without being insulted and pulled about by every policeman she comes across
that will be for the examining magistrate to decide said guerchard and he went to the door and called bonavent
bonavent came in and guerchard said when the prison van comes put this woman in it and send her down to the station
but what have i done cried victoire
it s not a crime to carry a piece of chalk in one s pocket
now that s a matter for the examining magistrate
you can explain it to him said guerchard
i ve got nothing to do with it so it s no good making a fuss now
do go quietly there s a good woman
victoire looked him in the eyes then drew herself up and went quietly out of the room
chapter xvii sonia s escape one of formery s innocents said guerchard turning to the duke
it s blue said guerchard holding it out
the same as that of the signatures on the walls
add that fact to the woman s sudden realization of what she was doing and you ll see that they were written with it
it is rather a surprise said the duke
to look at her you would think that she was the most honest woman in the world
ah you don t know lupin your grace said guerchard
he can do anything with women and they ll do anything for him
and what s more as far as i can see it doesn t make a scrap of difference whether they re honest or not
the lady i was telling you about was probably an honest woman ganimard is sure of it
we should have found out long ago who she was if she had been a wrong un
and ganimard also swears that when he arrested lupin on board the some woman some ordinary honest woman among the passengers carried away lady garland s jewels which he had stolen and was bringing to america and along with them a matter of eight hundred pounds which he had stolen from a on the voyage
that power of fascination which some men exercise on women is one of those mysteries which science should investigate before it does anything else said the duke in a reflective tone
now i come to think of it i had much better have spent my time on that investigation than on that tedious journey to the south pole
all the same i m deucedly sorry for that woman victoire
guerchard shrugged his shoulders the prisons are full of good souls he said with cynical wisdom born of experience
they get caught so much more often than the bad
it seems rather mean of lupin to make use of women like this and get them into trouble said the duke
but he doesn t said guerchard quickly
this victoire is the first we ve caught
he walked across the room picked up his cloak and took a from the inner pocket of it
if you don t mind your grace i want you to show this permit to my men who are keeping the door whenever you go out of the house
it s just a formality but i attach considerable importance to it for i really ought not to make exceptions in favour of any one
i have two men at the door and they have orders to let nobody out without my written permission
of course s guests are different
bonavent has orders to pass them out
and if your grace doesn t mind it will help me
if you carry a permit no one else will dream of complaining of having to do so
oh i don t mind if it s of any help to you said the duke cheerfully
and he wrote on his card and handed it to the duke
the duke took it and looked at it
on it was written pass the duke of charmerace
it s quite military said the duke putting the card into his waistcoat pocket
there came a knock at the door and a tall thin bearded man came into the room
dieusy saluted i ve learnt that a was waiting outside the next the side street he said
between four and five in the morning said dieusy
he thinks that it was nearly five o clock when the van drove off
then they filled up the opening before they loaded the van
i thought they would said guerchard thoughtfully
anything else a few minutes after the van had gone a man in motoring dress came out of the house said dieusy
in motoring dress said guerchard quickly
and a little way from the house he threw away his cigarette
the scavenger thought the whole business a little queer and he picked up the cigarette and kept it
he handed it to guerchard whose eyes scanned it carelessly and then glued themselves to it
why your grace this is one of your cigarettes
it s merely another link in the chain
i ve no doubt you have some of these cigarettes at charmerace
oh yes i ve had a box on most of the tables said the duke
well there you are said guerchard
oh i see what you re driving at said the duke
you mean that one of the charolais must have taken a box
well we know that they d hardly stick at a box of cigarettes said guerchard
but i thought said the duke and he paused
you thought what said guerchard
then lupin since it was lupin who managed the business last you found those salvias in the house next door
then lupin came from charmerace
and lupin is one of the charolais
oh that s another matter said guerchard
but it s certain absolutely certain said the duke
we have the connecting links the salvias this cigarette
you re pretty quick on a scent i must say said guerchard
what a detective you would have made
was he at charmerace yesterday or was he not
did he or did he not arrange the theft of the
but he himself might have remained in the background all the while said guerchard
by jove i should like to see this fellow
we shall see him said guerchard
of course we shall for he will come to steal the coronet between a quarter to twelve and midnight said guerchard
you don t really believe that he ll have the cheek to attempt such a mad act
ah you don t know this man your grace his extraordinary mixture of coolness and audacity
it s the danger that attracts him
he throws himself into the fire and he doesn t get burnt
for the last ten years i ve been saying to myself here we are this time i ve got him
but i ve said that day after day said guerchard and he paused
well the days pass and i never nab him
he s a joker he is a regular artist ground his the damned thief
the duke looked at him and said slowly then you think that you ve followed the scent with me your grace guerchard interrupted quickly and vehemently
we ve picked up each clue together
you ve almost seen this man at work
isn t a man like this i ask you capable of anything
he is said the duke with conviction
guerchard turned to dieusy and said in a quieter voice and when the scavenger had picked up the cigarette did he follow the motorist
yes he followed him for about a hundred yards
he went down into sureau street and turned westwards
then a came along he got into it and went off
a big car and dark red in colour said dieusy
that s all i ve got so far sir said dieusy
now that you ve got started you ll probably get something else before very long
things are beginning to move said guerchard cheerfully
after all it ought not to be very difficult to trace that said guerchard in a musing tone
at any rate its movements ought to be easy enough to follow up till about six
then of course there would be a good many others about delivering goods
you seem to have all the possible information you can want at your said the duke in an admiring tone
i suppose i know the life of paris as well as anybody said guerchard
then germaine s maid irma came into the room and said if you please your grace mademoiselle kritchnoff would like to speak to you for a moment
oh very well i ll go up to her said the duke
i can speak to her in the library
he rose and was going towards the door when guerchard stepped forward barring his way and said no your grace
i beg you will wait a minute or two till i ve had a word with you said guerchard and he drew a folded sheet of paper from his pocket and held it up
the duke looked at guerchard s face and he looked at the paper in his hand then he said oh very well
and turning to irma he added quietly tell mademoiselle kritchnoff that i m in the
yes your grace in the said irma and she turned to go
yes and say that i shall be engaged for the next five next five minutes do you understand said the duke
yes your grace said irma and she went out of the door
ask mademoiselle kritchnoff to put on her hat and cloak said guerchard
the duke turned sharply on guerchard and said now why on earth
i got this from formery said guerchard holding up the paper
it s a warrant your grace said guerchard
not for the arrest of mademoiselle kritchnoff
oh come it s impossible said the duke
you re never going to arrest that child
her examination this afternoon was in the highest degree unsatisfactory
her answers were embarrassed contradictory and in every way suspicious
and you ve made up your mind to arrest her said the duke slowly knitting his brow in anxious thought
the prison van ought to be waiting at the door
she and victoire can go together
you re going to arrest her said the duke thoughtfully and he took a step or two up and down the room still thinking hard
well you understand the position don t you your grace said guerchard in a tone of apology
believe me that personally i ve no animosity against mademoiselle kritchnoff
yes said the duke softly in a musing tone
she has the air of a child who has lost its way lost its way in life
and that poor little she found that handkerchief thrown down in the corner of the little room in the house next door
a handkerchief cried guerchard with an air of sudden utter surprise
the child s clumsiness is positively pitiful said the duke
the pearls of the pendant cried guerchard
yes i supposed you knew all about it
of course formery left word for you said the duke with an air of surprise at the ignorance of the detective
no i ve heard nothing about it cried guerchard
he didn t leave word for you said the duke in a tone of greater surprise
oh well i dare say that he thought would do
of course you were out of the house when he found it
she must have slipped out of her room soon after you went
he found a handkerchief belonging to mademoiselle kritchnoff
m formery took the pearls but he left the handkerchief
i suppose it s in the corner where he found it said the duke
he left the handkerchief cried guerchard
if that isn t just like the fool
he ought to keep hens it s all he s fit for
he ran to the fireplace seized the lantern and began lighting it where is the handkerchief
in the corner of the little room on the right on the second floor
but if you re going to arrest mademoiselle kritchnoff why are you bothering about the handkerchief
it can t be of any importance said the duke
i beg your pardon said guerchard
i was arresting mademoiselle kritchnoff all right because i had a very strong presumption of her guilt
but i hadn t the slightest proof of it said guerchard
what cried the duke in a horrified tone
no you ve just given me the proof and since she was able to hide the pearls in the house next door she knew the road which led to it
therefore she s an accomplice said guerchard in a triumphant tone
do you think that too cried the duke
it s my fault that you ve got your proof
he spoke in a tone of acute distress
it was your duty to give it me said guerchard sternly and he began to mount the steps
i know where the handkerchief is said the duke quickly
no thank you your grace said guerchard
you d better let me help you said the duke
no your grace said guerchard firmly
i must really insist said the duke
said guerchard vehemently with stern decision
it s no use your insisting your grace i prefer to go alone
i shall only be gone a minute or two
just as you like said the duke stiffly
the legs of guerchard disappeared up the steps
the duke stood listening with all his ears
directly he heard the sound of guerchard s heels on the floor when he dropped from the of the next room he went swiftly to the door opened it and went out
bonavent was sitting on the chair on which the young policeman had sat during the afternoon
sonia in her hat and cloak was down the stairs
the duke put his head inside the door and said to the empty room here is mademoiselle kritchnoff guerchard
he held open the door sonia came down the stairs and went through it
the duke followed her into the and shut the door
there s not a moment to lose he said in a low voice
oh what is it your grace said sonia anxiously
guerchard has a warrant for your arrest
no one can get out of the house
guerchard won t let them cried sonia
we can get over that said the duke
he ran to guerchard s cloak took the from the inner pocket went to the and sat down
he took from his pocket the permit which guerchard had given him and a pencil
then he took a card from the set the permit on the table before him and began to imitate guerchard s handwriting with an amazing exactness
he wrote on the card pass mademoiselle kritchnoff
sonia stood by his side panting quickly with fear and watched him do it
he had scarcely finished the last stroke when they heard a noise on the other side of the opening into the empty house
the duke looked at the fireplace and his teeth bared in an expression of cold ferocity
he rose with clenched fists and took a step towards the fireplace
your grace called the voice of guerchard
what is it answered the duke quietly
i can t see any handkerchief said guerchard
didn t you say it was in the corner of the little room on the right
i told you you d better let me come with you and find it said the duke in a tone of triumph
it s in the corner of the little room on the left
i could have sworn you said the little room on the right said guerchard
they heard his footfalls die away
now you must get out of the house quickly
show this card to the detectives at the door and they ll pass you without a word
he pressed the card into her hand
there s no time to lose said the duke
when guerchard finds out about this there s no need to bother about that interrupted the duke quickly
i ve forgotten the name of it said sonia
but this has it a telephone said the duke
if i haven t telephoned to you before eight morning come straight to my house said the duke scribbling the telephone number on his
when guerchard knows when he discovers
oh i can t let you get into trouble for me
but said the duke and he slipped his right arm round her and drew her to the door
oh how good you are to me said sonia softly
the duke s other arm went round her he drew her to him and their lips met
he loosed her and opened the door saying loudly you re sure you won t have a cab mademoiselle kritchnoff
and she went through the door with a transfigured face
chapter xviii the duke stays the duke shut the door and leant against it listening anxiously breathing quickly
there came the bang of the front door
with a deep sigh of relief he left the door came briskly smiling across the room and put the back into the pocket of guerchard s cloak
he lighted a cigarette dropped into an easy chair and sat waiting with an entirely careless air for the detective s return
presently he heard quick footsteps on the bare boards of the empty room beyond the opening
then guerchard came down the steps and out of the fireplace
his face wore an expression of extreme perplexity i can t understand it he said
are you sure you saw the handkerchief in one of those little rooms on the second sure said guerchard
you can t have looked properly said the duke with a touch of irony in his voice
if i were you i should go back and look again
if i ve looked for a thing i ve looked for it
there s no need for me to look a second time
but all the same it s rather funny
doesn t it strike you as being rather funny your grace said guerchard with a worried air
it strikes me as being uncommonly funny said the duke with an ambiguous smile
guerchard looked at him with a sudden uneasiness then he rang the bell
mademoiselle kritchnoff bonavent
mademoiselle kritchnoff said bonavent with an air of surprise
yes it s time that she was taken to the
mademoiselle kritchnoff has gone sir said bonavent in a tone of quiet remonstrance
what do you mean by gone said guerchard
gone sir gone said bonavent patiently
but who let her go cried guerchard
the men at the door said bonavent
the men at the door said guerchard in a tone of stupefaction
bonavent went to the top of the staircase and called down it
two detectives came hurrying up the stairs and into the
what the devil do you mean by letting mademoiselle kritchnoff leave the house without my permit written on my card cried guerchard violently
but she had your permit sir and it was written on your card stammered one of the detectives
he stood thoughtful for a moment
then quietly he told his two men to go back to their post
he did not stir for a minute or two puzzling it out seeking light
then he came back slowly into the and looked uneasily at the duke
the duke was sitting in his easy chair smoking a cigarette with a listless air
guerchard looked at him and looked at him almost as if he now saw him for the first time
well said the duke have you sent that poor child off to prison
if i d done a thing like that i don t think i should sleep very well guerchard
that poor child has just escaped by means of a forged permit said guerchard very glumly
you ll forgive my lack of sympathy guerchard but she was such a child
not too young to be lupin s accomplice said guerchard drily
you really think she is said the duke in a tone of doubt
i m sure of it said guerchard with decision then he added slowly with a perplexed air
the duke shook his head and looked as solemn as an owl
guerchard looked at him uneasily went out of the and shut the door
how long has mademoiselle kritchnoff been gone he said to bonavent
not much more than five minutes said bonavent
she came out from talking to you in the talking to me in the
she came out and went straight down the stairs and out of the house
a faint sighing gasp came from guerchard s lips
he dashed into the crossed the room quickly to his cloak picked it up took the out of the pocket and counted the cards in it
the duke smiled at him a charming smile almost caressing
there seemed to be a lump in guerchard s throat he swallowed it loudly
he put the into the of the coat he was wearing
bonavent opened the door and stood in the doorway
you sent off victoire in the i suppose said guerchard
oh a long while ago sir said bonavent
the van had been waiting at the door since nine
but i told them i shouldn t want it till a quarter to eleven
i suppose they were making an effort to be in time for once
well it doesn t matter said guerchard
then i suppose i d better send the other away said bonavent
the van which has just arrived said bonavent
what on earth are you talking about cried guerchard with a sudden anxiety in his voice and on his face
didn t you order two said bonavent
guerchard jumped and his face went purple with fury and dismay
you don t mean to tell me that two have been here
in which of them did you put victoire
in which of them why in the first sir said bonavent
did you see the police in charge of it
did you recognize them said guerchard
no said bonavent they must have been new men
they told me they came from the sant√©
you silly fool said guerchard through his teeth
why what s the matter said bonavent
but i don t understand said bonavent
you ve sent victoire away in a sham belonging to lupin
he always has something up his sleeve
he certainly shows foresight said the duke
it was very clever of him to foresee the arrest of victoire and provide against it
where is the leakage cried guerchard fuming
how did he learn that the doctor said that she would recover her wits at ten o clock
here i ve had a guard at the door all day i ve imprisoned the household all the provisions have been received directly by a man of mine and here he is ready to pick up victoire the very moment she gives herself away
he turned on bonavent and went on it s no use your standing there with your mouth open looking like a fool
go upstairs to the servants quarters and search victoire s room again
that fool of an inspector may have missed something just as he missed victoire herself
guerchard paced up and down the room scowling
really i m beginning to agree with you guerchard that this lupin is a remarkable man said the duke
but what fools i have to work with
if i could get hold of people of ordinary intelligence it would be impossible to play such a trick as that
i don t know about that said the duke thoughtfully
i think it would have required an uncommon fool to discover that trick
because it s so wonderfully simple said the duke
and at the same time it s such infernal cheek
there s something in that said guerchard grumpily
but then i m always saying to my men suspect everything suspect everybody suspect suspect suspect
i tell you your grace that there is only one motto for the successful detective and that is that one word suspect
it can t be a very comfortable business then said the duke
but i suppose it has its charms
oh one gets used to the disagreeable part said guerchard
the telephone bell rang and he rose and went to it
he put the receiver to his ear and said yes it s guerchard
he turned and said to the duke it s the gardener at charmerace your grace
is it said the duke indifferently
guerchard turned to the telephone
i want to know who was in your yesterday who could have gathered some of your pink salvias
i told you that it was i said the duke
and he turned again to the telephone
no one but the duke of charmerace
yes that s all i wanted to know thank you
he turned to the duke and said did you hear that your grace
the gardener says that you were the only person in his yesterday the only person who could have plucked any pink salvias
does he said the duke carelessly
guerchard looked at him his brow knitted in a faint pondering frown
then the door opened and bonavent came in i ve been through victoire s room he said and all i could find that might be of any use is
it was on her just as she left it
the inspector hadn t touched it
what about it said guerchard taking the
there s a photograph in it said bonavent
it may come in useful when we circulate her description for i suppose we shall try to get hold of victoire
guerchard took the photograph from the and looked at it it looks about ten years old he said
it s a good deal faded for reproduction
the photograph showed victoire in her sunday best and with her a boy of seventeen or eighteen
guerchard s eyes glued themselves to the face of the boy
he stared at it holding the portrait now nearer now further off
his eyes kept stealing covertly from the photograph to the face of the duke
the duke caught one of those covert glances and a vague uneasiness flickered in his eyes
he came nearer to the duke and looked at him earnestly as if he couldn t believe his eyes
what s the matter said the duke
what are you looking at so curiously
and he put up his hand and felt it
oh nothing nothing said guerchard
and he studied the photograph again with a frowning face
there was a noise of voices and laughter in the hall
those people are going said the duke
and he rose and went out of the room
guerchard stood staring staring at the photograph
the duke ran down the stairs and said goodbye to the millionaire s guests
after they had gone went quickly up the stairs germaine and the duke followed more slowly
my father is going to the ritz to sleep said germaine and i m going with him
he doesn t like the idea of my sleeping in this house
i suppose he s afraid that lupin will make an attack in force with all his gang
still if he did i think that guerchard could give a good account of s got men enough in the house at any rate
irma tells me it s swarming with them
it would never do for me to be in the house if there were a fight
oh come you don t really believe that lupin is coming said the duke with a sceptical laugh
the whole thing is sheer has no more intention of coming tonight to steal that coronet i have
oh well there s no harm in being on the safe side said germaine
everybody s agreed that he s a very terrible person
i ll just run up to my room and get a wrap irma has my things all packed
she can come round tomorrow morning to the ritz and dress me
she ran up the stairs and the duke went into the
he found guerchard standing where he had left him still frowning still thinking hard
it s rather a reflection on your powers of protecting them isn t it said the duke
oh well i expect they d be happier out of the house said guerchard
he looked at the duke again with inquiring searching eyes
oh no no it s quite straight your grace said guerchard but he did not take his eyes from the duke s face
the door opened and in came holding a bag in his hand
it seems to be settled that i m never to sleep in my own house again he said in a grumbling tone
there s no reason to go said the duke
you read lupin s telegram i shall come between a quarter to twelve and midnight to take the coronet
he knows that it was in my bedroom
do you think i m going to sleep in that room with the chance of that scoundrel turning up and cutting my throat
oh you can have a dozen policemen in the room if you like said the duke
i can answer for it that you will be in no danger
but all the same outside is good enough for me
germaine came into the room cloaked and ready to start
for once in a way you are ready first papa she said
no i think i ll stay here on the chance that lupin is not bluffing said the duke
i don t think myself that i m going to be gladdened by the sight of fact i m ready to bet against it
but you re all so certain about it that i really must stay on the chance
and after all there s no doubt that he s a man of immense audacity and ready to take any risk
well at any rate if he does come he won t find the diadem said in a tone of triumph
i m taking it with ve got it here
do you think it s wise said the duke
if lupin s really made up his mind to collar that coronet and if you re so sure that in spite of all these safeguards he s going to make the attempt it seems to me that you re taking a considerable risk
he asked you to have it ready for him in your bedroom
said with an air of sudden and very lively alarm
his grace is right said guerchard
it would be exactly like lupin to send that telegram to drive you out of the house with the coronet to some place where you would be less protected
that is exactly one of his tricks
good heavens said the millionaire pulling out his keys and unlocking the bag
he opened it paused hesitatingly and snapped it to again
he led the way out of the door and the duke followed him
he shut the door and said in a whisper in a case like this i suspect everybody
everybody suspects everybody apparently said the duke
are you sure you don t suspect me
now now this is no time for joking said the millionaire impatiently
what do you think about guerchard
do you think i can put full confidence in guerchard said
besides i shall be here to look after guerchard
and though i wouldn t undertake to answer for lupin i think i can answer for guerchard
if he tries to escape with the coronet i will wring his neck for you with pleasure
and it would do guerchard good too
the millionaire stood reflecting for a minute or two
then he said very good i ll trust him
hardly had the door closed behind the millionaire and the duke when guerchard crossed the room quickly to germaine and drew from his pocket the photograph of victoire and the young man
do you know this photograph of his grace mademoiselle
germaine took the photograph and looked at it
yes it s about ten years old said guerchard
i seem to know the face of the woman said germaine
but if it s ten years old it certainly isn t the photograph of the duke
but it s like him said guerchard
oh yes it s like the duke as he is least it s a little like him
but it s not like the duke as he was ten years ago
he has changed so said germaine
yes there was that exhausting journey of then his illness
the doctors gave up all hope of him you know
but his health is quite restored now
the door opened and the millionaire and the duke came into the room
set his bag upon the table unlocked it and with a solemn air took out the case which held the coronet
he opened it and they looked at it
closed the case and said solemnly there is danger guerchard so i am going to trust the coronet to you
you are the defender of my hearth and are the proper person to guard the coronet
i take it that you have no objection
not the slightest said guerchard
it s exactly what i wanted you to ask me to do
then he handed the coronet to guerchard saying with a frank and noble air i have every confidence in you guerchard
i think after all i ll change my mind and go with you
i m very short of sleep said the duke
you re never going too your grace cried guerchard
why you don t want me to stay do you said the duke
i think i would rather go to bed said the duke gaily
are you afraid said guerchard and there was challenge almost an insolent challenge in his tone
the duke frowned slightly with a reflective air
then he drew himself up and said a little haughtily you ve certainly found the way to make me stay guerchard
it s an excellent idea excellent
you re the very man to help guerchard duke
you re an intrepid explorer used to danger and resourceful absolutely fearless
do you really mean to say you re not going home to bed jacques said germaine disregarding her father s wish with her usual frankness
no i m going to stay with guerchard said the duke slowly
well you will be fresh to go to the princess s night
you didn t get any sleep at all last night you couldn t have
you left charmerace at eight o clock you were motoring all the night and only got to paris at six o clock this morning
motoring all night from eight o clock to six muttered guerchard under his breath
oh that will be all right said the duke carelessly
this interesting affair is to be over by midnight isn t it
well i warn you that tired or fresh you will have to come with me to the princess s night
all paris will be paris that is who are in paris
oh i shall be fresh enough said the duke
they went out of the and down the stairs all four of them
there was an alert readiness about guerchard as if he were ready to spring
he kept within a foot of the duke right to the front door
the detective in charge opened it and they went down the steps to the which was awaiting them
the duke kissed germaine s fingers and handed her into the
paused at the and turned and said with a pathetic air am i never to sleep in my own house again
he got into the cab and drove off
the duke turned and came up the steps followed by guerchard
in the hall he took his and coat from the stand and went upstairs
up the flight he paused and said where shall we wait for lupin guerchard
in the or in s bedroom oh the said guerchard
i think it very unlikely that lupin will look for the coronet in s bedroom
he would know very well that that is the last place to find it now
at the door guerchard stopped and said i will just go and post my men your grace
very good said the duke and he went into the
he sat down lighted a cigarette and yawned
then he took out his watch and looked at it
the duke goes when guerchard joined the duke in the he had lost his calm air and was looking more than a little nervous
he moved about the room uneasily fingering the glancing at the duke and looking quickly away from him again
then he came to a standstill on the with his back to the fireplace
do you think it s quite safe to stand there at least with your back to the hearth
if lupin dropped through that opening suddenly he d catch you from behind before you could wink twice said the duke in a tone of remonstrance
there would always be your grace to come to my rescue said guerchard and there was an ambiguous note in his voice while his piercing eyes now rested fixed on the duke s face
they seemed never to leave it they explored and explored it
it s only a suggestion said the duke
this is rather nervous work don t you know
yes and of course you re hardly fit for it said guerchard
if i d known about your in your car last night i should have hesitated about asking a
yes you left charmerace at eight o clock last night
and you only reached paris at six this morning
you couldn t have had a very car said guerchard
then you must have had a devil of a said guerchard
yes it was pretty bad but i ve known worse said the duke carelessly
it lost me about three hours oh at least three hours
i m not a repairer though i know as much about an engine as most motorists
and there was nobody there to help you repair it said guerchard
no could not let me have his chauffeur to drive me to paris because he was keeping him to help guard the ch√¢teau
and of course there was nobody on the road because it was two o clock in the morning
yes there was no one said guerchard slowly
it was unfortunate said guerchard and there was a note of incredulity in his voice
my having to repair the car myself said the duke
yes of course said guerchard hesitating a little over the assent
the duke dropped the end of his cigarette into a tray and took out his case
he held it out towards guerchard and said a cigarette
or perhaps you prefer your caporal
yes i do but all the same i ll have one said guerchard coming quickly across the room
and he took a cigarette from the case and looked at it
all the same all this is very curious he said in a new tone a challenging menacing accusing tone
what said the duke looking at him curiously
everything your cigarettes the salvias the photograph that bonavent found in victoire s that man in motoring dress and finally your said guerchard and the accusation and the threat rang clearer
the duke rose from his chair quickly and said haughtily in icy tones m guerchard you ve been drinking
he went to the chair on which he had set his overcoat and his hat and picked them up
guerchard sprang in front of him barring his way and cried in a shaky voice no don t go
what do you mean said the duke and paused
guerchard stepped back and ran his hand over his forehead
he was very pale and his forehead was clammy to his touch
i must be going mad he stammered
it looks very like it said the duke coldly
what i mean to say is said guerchard in a halting uncertain voice what i mean to say is help me
i want you to stay here to help me against lupin you understand
will you your grace yes certainly of course i will if you want me to said the duke in a more gentle voice
but you seem awfully upset and you re upsetting me too
we shan t have a nerve between us soon if you don t pull yourself together
yes yes please excuse me muttered guerchard
but what is it we re going to do
he pulled out his handkerchief and mopped his forehead well the coronet is it in this case
he said in a shaky voice and set the case on the table
of course it is said the duke impatiently
guerchard opened the case and the coronet sparkled and gleamed brightly in the electric light yes it is there you see it said guerchard
yes i see it well said the duke looking at him in some bewilderment so unlike himself did he seem
we re going to wait said guerchard
and you actually do believe that just as in a fairy tale when that clock strikes twelve lupin will enter and take the coronet
yes i do i do said guerchard with stubborn conviction
this is most exciting said the duke
you re sure it doesn t bore you said guerchard huskily
not a bit of it said the duke with cheerful derision
to make the acquaintance of this scoundrel who has fooled you for ten years is as charming a way of spending the evening as i can think of
you say that to me said guerchard with a touch of temper
yes said the duke with a challenging smile
he sat down in an easy chair by the table
guerchard sat down in a chair on the other side of it and set his elbows on it
suddenly the duke said somebody s coming
guerchard started and said no i don t hear any one
then there came distinctly the sound of a footstep and a knock at the door
you ve got keener ears than i said guerchard grudgingly
in all this business you ve shown the qualities of a very promising detective
he rose went to the door and unlocked it
bonavent came in i ve brought you the handcuffs sir he said holding them out
you ve two men at the back door and two at the front and a man in every room on the
yes and i ve got three men on every other floor said bonavent in a tone of satisfaction
and the house next door said guerchard
there are a dozen men in it said bonavent
no communication between the two houses is possible any longer
guerchard watched the duke s face with intent eyes
not a shadow flickered its careless serenity
if any one tries to enter the house collar him
if need be fire on him said guerchard firmly
that is my order go and tell the others
very good sir said bonavent and he went out of the room
by jove we are in a regular fortress said the duke
it s even more of a fortress than you think your grace
i ve four men on that landing said guerchard nodding towards the door
oh have you said the duke with a sudden air of annoyance
you don t like that said guerchard quickly
i should jolly well think not said the duke
with these precautions lupin will never be able to get into this room at all
he ll find it a pretty hard job said guerchard smiling
unless he falls from the ceiling or unless you re ars√®ne lupin interrupted the duke
in that case you d be another your grace said guerchard
the duke rose yawned picked up his coat and hat and said ah well i m off to bed
well said the duke yawning again i was staying to see lupin
as there s no longer any chance of seeing but there is there is so stay cried guerchard
do you still cling to that notion said the duke wearily
guerchard lowered his voice and said with an air of the deepest secrecy he s already here your grace
where cried the astonished duke
as one of your men said the duke eagerly
i don t think so said guerchard watching him closely
well but well he s here we ve got him
he is going to turn up said the duke triumphantly and he set down his hat on the table beside the coronet
how do you mean said the duke with a puzzled air
well you have said yourself that this is a fortress
an hour ago perhaps lupin was resolved to enter this room but is he now
i see what you mean said the duke in a tone of disappointment
yes you see that now it needs the devil s own courage
he must risk everything to gain everything and throw off the mask
is lupin going to throw himself into the wolf s jaws
guerchard s husky voice had hardened to a rough harshness there was a ring of acute anxiety in it and under the anxiety a faint note of challenge of a challenge that dare not make itself too distinct
his anxious challenging eyes burned on the face of the duke as if they strove with all intensity to pierce a mask
the duke looked at him curiously as if he were trying to divine what he would be at but with a careless curiosity as if it were a matter of indifference to him what the detective s object was then he said carelessly well you ought to know better than i you have known him for ten years
he paused and added with just the faintest stress in his tone at least by reputation
the anxiety in the detective s face grew plainer it almost gave him the air of being unnerved and he said quickly in a jerky voice yes and i know his way of acting too
during the last ten years i have learnt to unravel his understand and anticipate his manoeuvres
instead of lying low as you d expect he attacks his opponent
he smiled a a smile it is a mass of entangled mysterious combinations
i ve been caught in them myself again and again
it interests me so said the duke in a tone of apology
oh it interests me said guerchard with a snarl
but this time i see my way clearly
we re fighting in the light of day
he paused and said in a clear sneering voice lupin has pluck perhaps but it s only thief s pluck
oh is it said the duke sharply and there was a sudden faint glitter in his eyes
yes rogues have very poor qualities sneered guerchard
one can t have everything said the duke quietly but his languid air had fallen from him
their ambushes their attacks their fine tactics aren t up to much said guerchard smiling contemptuously
you go a trifle too far i think said the duke smiling with equal contempt
they looked one another in the eyes with a long lingering look
they had suddenly the air of fencers who have lost their tempers and are twisting the buttons off their foils
not a bit of it your grace said guerchard and his voice lingered on the words your grace with a contemptuous stress
this famous lupin is immensely overrated
however he has done some things which aren t half bad said the duke with his old charming smile
he had the air of a duelist drawing his blade lovingly through his fingers before he falls to
oh has he said guerchard scornfully
last night s burglary for instance it is not unheard of but it wasn t half bad
and that theft of the motorcars it was a neat piece of work said the duke in a gentle insolent voice infinitely aggravating
and a robbery at the british embassy another at the treasury and a third at lepine in the same wasn t half bad don t you know said the duke in the same gentle irritating voice
and the time when he contrived to pass as great you remember that
come give the devil his wasn t half bad
but he has done better than that lately
of the time when he passed as the duke of charmerace snapped guerchard
did he do that cried the duke and then he added slowly but you know i m like m so easy to what would have been amusing your grace would have been to get as far as actual marriage said guerchard more calmly
oh if he had wanted to said the duke and he threw out his hands
a large fortune a pretty girl said guerchard in a mocking tone
he must be in love with some one else said the duke
a thief perhaps sneered guerchard
and then if you wish to know what i think he must have found his fianc√©e rather trying said the duke with his charming smile
after all it s you must admit it that on the very eve of his marriage he was such a fool as to throw off the mask
and yet at bottom it s quite logical it s lupin coming out through charmerace
he had to grab at the dowry at the risk of losing the girl said guerchard in a reflective tone but his eyes were intent on the face of the duke
perhaps that s what one should call a marriage of reason said the duke with a faint smile
what a fall said guerchard in a taunting voice
to be expected eagerly at the princess s evening and to pass the evening in a to have intended in a month s time as the duke of charmerace to mount the steps of the madeleine with all pomp and to fall down the s staircase this very evening voice rose suddenly on a note of savage with the handcuffs on
is that a good enough revenge for that poor old idiot guerchard
the rogues brummel in a convict s cap
for lupin it s only a trifling annoyance but for a duke it s a disaster
come in your turn be frank don t you find that amusing
the duke rose quietly and said coldly have you finished
do you cried guerchard and he rose and faced him
oh yes i find it quite amusing said the duke lightly
no you re frightened said the duke calmly
frightened cried guerchard with a savage laugh
yes you re frightened said the duke
and don t think policeman that because i m familiar with you i throw off a mask
you escaped from the sant√© four years ago
prove it said the duke scornfully
you know dear boy said the duke tauntingly
dear boy cried guerchard triumphantly as if the word had been a confession
what do i risk said the duke with scathing contempt
you can arrest lupin but arrest the duke of charmerace an honourable gentleman member of the jockey club and of the union residing at his house  b university street arrest the duke of charmerace the fiance of mademoiselle
scoundrel cried guerchard pale with sudden helpless fury
make yourself the of paris call your coppers in
oh i shall get them howled guerchard beside himself
i think you may said the duke coolly
and you might be able to arrest me next week
the day after perhaps perhaps never but not that s certain
oh if only somebody could hear you
now don t excite yourself said the duke
that won t produce any proofs for you
the fact is formery told you the truth when he said that when it is a case of lupin you lose your head
ah that is an intelligent man if you like
at all events the coronet is safe wait my good chap wait said the duke slowly and then he snapped out do you know what s behind that door
and he flung out his hand towards the door of the inner with a mysterious sinister air
what cried guerchard and he whipped round and faced the door with his eyes starting out of his head
said the duke with a great laugh
i said that you were going to be absolutely pitiable said the duke and he laughed again cruelly
cried guerchard mopping his forehead
absolutely pitiable said the duke with a cold disquieting certainty
as the hand of that clock moves nearer and nearer midnight you will grow more and more terrified
he paused and then shouted violently attention
guerchard jumped and then he swore
your nerves are on edge said the duke laughing
oh you re as brave as the next man
but who can stand the anguish of the unknown thing which is bound to happen
at the end of these few fixed minutes an inevitable fated event must happen
don t shrug your shoulders man you re green with fear
the duke was no longer a smiling cynical dandy
there emanated from him an impression of vivid terrible force
it thrilled with a consciousness of irresistible power it was overwhelming paralyzing
bear in mind that it is always when you have foreseen everything arranged everything made every combination bear in mind that it is always then that some accident dashes your whole structure to the ground said the duke in the same deep thrilling voice
remember that it is always at the very moment at which you are going to triumph that he beats you that he only lets you reach the top of the ladder to throw you more easily to the ground
confess then that you are lupin muttered guerchard
i thought you were sure of it said the duke in a jeering tone
guerchard dragged the handcuffs out of his pocket and said between his teeth i don t know what prevents me my boy
the duke drew himself up and said haughtily that s enough
i say that that s enough said the duke sternly
it s all very well for me to play at being familiar with you but don t you call me my boy
oh you won t impose on me much longer muttered guerchard and his bloodshot haggard eyes scanned the duke s face in an agony an anguish of doubting impotence
if i m lupin arrest me said the duke
i ll arrest you in three minutes from now or the coronet will be untouched cried guerchard in a firmer tone
in three minutes from now the coronet will have been stolen and you will not arrest me said the duke in a tone of chilling certainty
there are only two minutes left said the duke and he drew a revolver from his pocket
cried guerchard drawing a revolver in his turn
what s the matter said the duke with an air of surprise
you haven t forbidden me to shoot lupin
i have my revolver ready since he s going to come
there are plenty of us said guerchard and he went towards the door
very well he said i ll stick it out alone
he was panting his bloodshot eyes rolled in their sockets the beads of cold sweat stood out on his forehead
he came back towards the table on unsteady feet trembling from head to foot in the last excitation of the nerves
he kept jerking his head to shake away the mist which kept dimming his eyes
at your slightest gesture at your slightest movement i ll fire he said jerkily and covered the duke with his revolver
i call myself the duke of charmerace
said the duke in a compelling thrilling voice
only fifty seconds said the duke
yes yes muttered guerchard huskily
and his eyes shot from the coronet to the duke from the duke to the coronet
in fifty seconds the coronet will be stolen said the duke
to guerchard the hands seemed to be standing still
he could have sworn at them for their slowness
then the first stroke rang out and the eyes of the two men met like crossing blades
twice the duke made the slightest movement
twice guerchard started forward to meet it
at the last stroke both their hands shot out
guerchard s fell heavily on the case which held the coronet
the duke s fell on the brim of his hat and he picked it up
then he cried triumphantly i have it now then have i won
but are you quite sure said the duke gaily
it s only the weight of it said the duke repressing a laugh
doesn t it strike you that it s just a trifle light
this is merely an said the duke with a gentle laugh
hell and damnation howled guerchard
the door flew open and half a dozen detectives rushed in
guerchard sank into a chair stupefied paralyzed this blow on the top of the strain of the struggle with the duke had broken him
gentlemen said the duke sadly the coronet has been stolen
they broke into cries of surprise and bewilderment surrounding the gasping guerchard with excited questions
the duke walked quietly out of the room
guerchard sobbed twice his eyes opened and in a dazed fashion wandered from face to face he said faintly where is he
guerchard staggered to his feet and cried hoarsely frantically stop him from leaving the house
the cold light of the early september morning illumined but dimly the charming of the duke of charmerace in his house at  b university street though it stole in through two large windows
the was on the first floor and the duke s bedroom opened into it
it was furnished in the most luxurious fashion but with a taste which nowadays infrequently accompanies luxury
the chairs were of the most comfortable but their lines were excellent the couch against the wall between the two windows was the last word in the matter of comfort
the colour scheme of a light was almost too bright for a man s room it would have better suited a boudoir
it suggested that the owner of the room enjoyed an uncommon lightness and cheerfulness of temperament
on the walls with wide gaps between them so that they did not clash hung three or four excellent pictures
two by degas a group of shepherdesses and shepherds in pink and blue and white beribboned silk by fragonard a portrait of a woman by a charming corot and two conder fans showed that the taste of their fortunate owner was at any rate eclectic
at the end of the room was of all curious things the opening into the well of a lift
the doors of it were open though the lift itself was on some other floor
to the left of the opening stood a its shelves loaded with books of a kind rather suited to a cultivated thoughtful man than to an idle dandy
beside the window and peering through the side of the curtain into the street stood charolais
but it was hardly the charolais who had paid that visit at the ch√¢teau de charmerace and departed so firmly in the millionaire s favourite
this was a paler charolais he lacked altogether the rich ruddy complexion of the millionaire s visitor
his nose too was thinner and showed none of the ripe acquaintance with the vintages of the world which had been so plainly displayed on it during its owner s visit to the country
again hair and eyebrows were no longer black but fair and his hair was no longer curly and luxuriant but thin and lank
his moustache had vanished and along with it the dress of a provincial man of business
he wore a livery of the charmeraces and at that early morning hour had not yet assumed the blue waistcoat which is an integral part of it
indeed it would have required an acute and experienced observer to recognize in him the bogus purchaser of the mercrac
only his eyes his eyes were unchanged
walking restlessly up and down the middle of the room keeping out of sight of the windows was victoire
she wore a very anxious air as did charolais too
by the door stood bernard charolais and his natural boyish timidity to judge from his frightened eyes had assumed an acute phase
cried charolais starting back from the window
no it was only the hall clock said bernard
oh where can he be said victoire wringing her hands
the coup was fixed for midnight
they must be after him said charolais
gingerly he drew back the curtain and resumed his watch
i ve sent down the lift to the bottom in case he should come back by the secret entrance said victoire and she went to the opening into the well of the lift and stood looking down it listening with all her ears
then why in the devil s name have you left the doors open cried charolais irritably
how do you expect the lift to come up if the doors are open
she stepped to the side of the lift and pressed a button
the doors closed and there was a grunting click of heavy machinery settling into a new position
suppose we telephone to justin at the passy house said victoire
what on earth s the good of that said charolais impatiently
justin knows no more than we do
the best thing we can do is to get out said bernard in a shaky voice
i haven t given up hope victoire protested
he s sure to come and he may need us
suppose they ransack his papers
what are we to do cried charolais in a tone of despair
well i m worse off than you are and i m not making a fuss
if the police come they ll arrest me said victoire
perhaps they ve arrested him said bernard in his shaky voice
don t talk like that said victoire fretfully
isn t it bad enough to wait and wait without your croaking like a scared crow
she started again her pacing up and down the room twisting her hands and now and again moistening her dry lips with the tip of her tongue
presently she said are those two men still there watching
and in her anxiety she came a step nearer the window
do you want to be recognized you great idiot
then he added more quietly they re still there all right curse them in front of the cafe
what is it now cried victoire starting
a copper and a detective running said charolais
they are running for all they re worth
are they coming this way said victoire and she ran to the door and caught hold of the handle
they re running to the two men watching the house
oh hang it they re all running down the street
are they coming this way cried victoire faintly and she pressed her hand to her side
and he dropped the curtain with an oath
suppose he comes to the front door
there came a startling peal at the bell
they stood frozen to stone their eyes fixed on one another staring
the bell had hardly stopped ringing when there was a slow whirring noise
the doors of the lift flew open and the duke stepped out of it
but what a changed figure from the admirably dressed dandy who had walked through the startled detectives and out of the house of at midnight
he was pale exhausted almost fainting
his eyes were dim in a livid face his lips were grey
he was splashed with mud from head to foot one sleeve of his coat was torn along half its length
the sole of his pump was half off and his cut foot showed white and red through the torn sock
the master cried charolais in a tone of extravagant relief and he danced round the room snapping his fingers
the bell rang out again startling threatening terrifying
the note of danger seemed to brace lupin to spur him to a last effort
he pulled himself together and said in a hoarse but steady voice your waistcoat charolais go and open the door not too quickly fumble the bolts
victoire get out of sight do you want to ruin us all
he staggered past them into his bedroom and slammed the door
victoire and charolais hurried out of the room through the anteroom on to the landing
victoire ran upstairs charolais went slowly down
the doors of the lift shut and there was a slow whirring as it went down
he pressed another button and the slid slowly across and hid the opening into the
bernard ran out of the room and up the stairs
charolais went to the front door and fumbled with the bolts
he bawled through the door to the visitors not to be in such a hurry at that hour in the morning and they bawled furiously at him to be quick and knocked and rang again and again
he was fully three minutes fumbling with the bolts which were already drawn
at last he opened the door an inch or two and looked out
on the instant the door was dashed open flinging him back against the wall and bonavent and dieusy rushed past him up the stairs as hard as they could pelt
a nervous active policeman followed them in and stopped to guard the door
on the landing the detectives paused and looked at one another hesitating
which way did he go said bonavent
i don t know but we ve jolly well stopped his getting into his own house and that s the main thing said dieusy triumphantly
but are you sure it was him said bonavent stepping into the anteroom
i can swear to it said dieusy confidently and he followed him
charolais came rushing up the stairs and caught them up as they were entering the here
your precious duke has been galloping all night cried dieusy
the door of the bedroom opened and lupin stood on the threshold in slippers and pyjamas
what s all this he snapped with the irritation of a man whose sleep has been disturbed and his tousled hair and eyes dim with exhaustion gave him every appearance of being still heavy with sleep
the eyes and mouths of bonavent and dieusy opened wide and they stared at him blankly in utter bewilderment and wonder
is it you who are making all this noise said lupin frowning at them
why i know you two you re in the service of guerchard
yes your grace stammered bonavent
there s been a mistake stammered bonavent
i should think there had been a mistake
but i take it that this is guerchard s doing
i d better deal with him directly
he turned to charolais and added curtly show them out
charolais opened the door and the two detectives went out of the room with the slinking air of whipped dogs
they went down the stairs in silence slowly reflectively and charolais let them out of the front door
as they went down the steps dieusy said what a howler
guerchard risks getting the sack for this
when the door closed behind the two detectives lupin tottered across the room dropped on to the couch with a groan of exhaustion and closed his eyes
presently the door opened victoire came in saw his attitude of exhaustion and with a startled cry ran to his side
oh do try to pull yourself together
she caught his cold hands and began to rub them murmuring words of endearment like a mother over a young child
lupin did not open his eyes charolais came in
he s had nothing to eat this morning
can you eat some breakfast dearie
hurry up with it said victoire in urgent imperative tones and charolais left the room at a run
oh what a life you lead said victoire or to be exact she wailed it
she stooped and lifted his legs on to the couch
he stretched himself and without opening his eyes said in a faint voice oh victoire what a fright i ve had
you ve been frightened cried victoire amazed
you needn t tell the others though
i must have been absolutely mad
once i had changed the coronet under that fat old fool s very eyes once you and sonia were out of their clutches all i had to do was to slip away
i stayed there out of sheer bravado just to score off guerchard
i who pride myself on being as cool as a cucumber
i did the one thing i ought not to have done
instead of going quietly away as the duke of charmerace
i started running running like a thief
in about two seconds i saw the slip i had made
it did not take me longer but that was too s men were on my track
then guerchard recognized you said victoire anxiously
as soon as the first paralysis had passed guerchard dared to see clearly to see the truth said lupin
i had passed the night before in a
in fact i was done for before i started
and they were gaining ground all the time
why didn t you hide said victoire
for a long while they were too close
they must have been within five feet of me
then i was crossing one of the bridges
i made up my mind that rather than be taken i d make an end of it
then i had a revulsion of feeling
at any rate i d stick it out to the end
i gave myself another minute one more last and i had my revolver on me
but during that minute i put forth every ounce of strength i had left
i had them pretty well strung out already
the knowledge gave me back my courage and i plugged on my feet did not feel so much as though they were made of lead
they were dropping behind all of them but one
we went at a a slow for i don t know how long
then we dropped to a could run no more and on we went
my strength and wind began to come back
i suppose my pursuer s did too for exactly what i expected happened
he gave a yell and dashed for me
i pretended to start running and when he was within three yards of me i dropped on one knee caught his ankles and chucked him over my head
i don t know whether he broke his neck or not
well there i was outside paris and i m hanged if i know where
i went on half a mile and then i rested
i would have given a hundred thousand francs for an hour s
but i dared not let myself sleep
oh it s then that i m frightened when you get a woman mixed up in your game
always when you come to grief when you really get into danger there s a woman in it
they always are said victoire drily
well i knew it was going to be a tough job so i took a good hour i should think
and then i started to walk back
i found that i had come a devil of a must have gone at marathon pace
i walked and walked and at last i got into paris and found myself with still a couple of miles to go
it was all right now i should soon find a cab
but the luck was dead against me
i heard a man come round the corner of a into a long street i was walking down
he gave a yell and came bucketing after me
off i went and the chase began again
i led him a dance but i couldn t shake him off
all the while i was working my way towards home
then just at last i spurted for all i was worth got out of his sight bolted round the corner of the street into the secret entrance and here i am
he smiled weakly and added oh my dear victoire what a profession it is chapter xxi the cutting of the telephone wires
the door opened and in came charolais bearing a tray
here s your breakfast master he said
don t call me s how his men address guerchard
it s a disgusting practice said lupin severely
victoire and charolais were quick laying the table
charolais kept up a running fire of questions as he did it but lupin did not trouble to answer them
he lay back relaxed drawing deep breaths
already his lips had lost their greyness and were pink there was a suggestion of blood under the skin of his pale face
they soon had the table laid and he walked to it on fairly steady feet
he sat down charolais whipped off a cover and said anyhow you ve got out of the mess neatly
so far it s all right said lupin
but there s going to be trouble of it
he fell upon his breakfast with the appetite but not the manners of a wolf
victoire hovered about him pouring out his coffee and putting sugar into it
by jove how good these eggs are
i think that of all the thousand ways of cooking eggs is the best
it s really a very healthy life this of mine victoire
oh yes it s all very well to talk said victoire in a scolding tone for since he was better she felt as a good woman should that the time had come to put in a word out of season
but all the same you re trying to kill s what you re doing
just because you re young you abuse your youth
it won t last for ever and you ll be sorry you used it up before it s time
and this life of lies and thefts and of all kinds of improper suppose it s going to begin all over again
it s no good your getting a lesson
what i want next is a bath said lupin
it s all very well your pretending not to listen to me when you know very well that i m speaking for your good she went on raising her voice a little
but i tell you that all this is going to end badly
to be a thief gives you no position in the position at when i think of what you made me do the night before last i m just horrified at myself
we d better not talk about mess you made of it
it was positively excruciating said lupin
i m an honest woman i am said victoire sharply
i wasn t brought up to do things like that thank goodness
and to begin at my time of life
it s true and i often ask myself how you bring yourself to stick to me said lupin in a reflective quite impersonal tone
please pour me out another cup of coffee
that s what i m always asking myself said victoire pouring out the coffee
i suppose it is because i m fond of you
yes and i m very fond of you my dear victoire said lupin in a coaxing tone
and then look you there are things that there s no understanding
i often talked to your poor mother about them
whatever would she have said to these
lupin helped himself to another cutlet his eyes twinkled and he said i m not sure that she would have been very much surprised
i always told her that i was going to punish society for the way it had treated her
do you think she would have been surprised
oh nothing you did would have surprised her said victoire
when you were quite a little boy you were always making us wonder
you gave yourself such airs and you had such nice manners of your different from the other boys
and you were already a bad boy when you were only seven years old full of all kinds of tricks and already you had begun to steal
yes you began by stealing sugar said victoire in the severe tones of a moralist
and then it was jam and then it was pennies
oh it was all very well at that little thief is pretty enough
really victoire you re absolutely depressing said lupin yawning and he helped himself to jam
i know very well that you re all right at heart said victoire
of course you only rob the rich and you ve always been kind to the poor
yes there s no doubt about it you have a good heart
i can t help about it said lupin smiling
well you ought to have different ideas in your head
you ought to try it yourself my dear victoire said lupin gently and he watched her with a humorous eye
goodness what a thing to say cried victoire
i assure you you ought said lupin in a tone of thoughtful conviction
i ve taken my degree in medicine and in law
i have been an actor and a professor of
i have even been a member of the detective force like that wretched guerchard
then i launched out into society
well i give you my word that not one of these professions equals that of even the profession of duke
there is so much of the unexpected in it splendid unexpected
and then it s full of variety so terrible so fascinating
his voice sank a little and he added and what fun it is
yes these rich men these swells in their one relieves them of a how they do howl
you should have seen that fat old when i relieved him of his an agony
you almost heard the in his throat
in the derangement of their it was sheer derangement mind prepared at charmerace in the derangement of guerchard i had only to put out my hand and pluck the coronet
and the joy the ineffable joy of enraging the police
to see guerchard s furious eyes when i downed him
he waved his hand round the luxurious room
this trade leads to everything to everything on condition that one sticks to it
i tell you victoire that when one can not be a great artist or a great soldier the only thing to be is a great thief
you re working yourself up you re intoxicating yourself
and all that it is not catholic
come at your age you ought to have one idea in your head which should drive out all these others which should make you forget all these thefts
love that would change you i m sure of it
that would make another man of you
yes perhaps that would make another man of me
i believe you re right said lupin thoughtfully
have you really been thinking of it cried victoire joyfully
yes said lupin smiling at her eagerness
but a real woman a woman for life cried victoire
yes said lupin softly and his eyes were shining in a very grave face
is it it real love dearie said victoire
she s very fair and a princess in a fairy tale said lupin softly
well since you ask me she s a thief said lupin with a mischievous smile
but she s a very charming thief said lupin and he rose smiling
he lighted a cigar stretched himself and yawned she had ever so much more reason for stealing than ever i had he said
and she has always hated it like poison
well that s something said victoire and her blank and fallen face brightened a little
lupin walked up and down the room breathing out long luxurious puffs of smoke from his excellent cigar and watching victoire with a humorous eye
he walked across to his and scanned the titles of his books with an appreciative almost affectionate smile
this is a very pleasant interlude he said languidly
but i don t suppose it s going to last very long
as soon as guerchard recovers from the shock of learning that i spent a quiet night in my ducal bed as an honest duke should he ll be getting to work with positively furious energy confound him
i could do with a whole day s solid hours of it
i m sure you could dearie said victoire sympathetically
the girl i m going to marry is sonia kritchnoff he said
sonia but why did you say she was a thief
it s my extraordinary sense of humour said lupin
the door opened and charolais bustled in shall i clear away the breakfast
lupin nodded and then the telephone bell rang
he put his finger on his lips and went to it
you want to speak to me presently
you re waiting for me at the ritz don t t isn t safe said victoire in a whisper
all right i ll be with you in about half an hour or perhaps
but i m ever so much more impatient than you
he put the receiver on the stand
is it so very serious said lupin
there ll be nothing but traps now and if i can find the time i shall certainly go and take a look at that one
if she s taking her revenge if she s getting you there to have you arrested said victoire
yes formery is probably at the ritz with
they re probably all of them there weighing the coronet said lupin with a chuckle
he hesitated a moment reflecting then he said how silly you are
if they wanted to arrest me if they had the material proof which they haven t got guerchard would be here already
then why did they chase you last night said charolais
but as it turned out they didn t catch me and when the detectives did come here they disturbed me in my sleep
and that me was ever so much more me than the man they followed
there aren t rather what there are i ve got
he pointed to a small safe let into the wall
in that safe are the coronet and above all the death certificate of the duke of charmerace everything that guerchard must have to induce formery to proceed
but still there is a think i d better have those things handy in case i have to bolt
he went into his bedroom and came back with the key of the safe and a
he opened the safe and took out the coronet the real coronet of the princesse de lamballe and along with it a with a few papers in it
he set the on the table ready to put in his when he should have dressed and dropped the coronet into the
i m glad i have that death certificate it makes it much safer he said
if ever they do nab me i don t wish that rascal guerchard to accuse me of having murdered the duke
that comes of having a good heart said victoire proudly
not even the duke of charmerace said charolais sadly
and it would have been so easy when he was one little draught
and he was in such a perfect out of the doctors
you do have such disgusting ideas charolais said lupin in a tone of severe reproof
instead of which you went and saved his life said charolais in a tone of deep discontent and he went on clearing the table
i did i did i had grown quite fond of him said lupin with a meditative air
for one thing he was so very like one
i m not sure that he wasn t even
no he was just like you said victoire with decision
any one would have said you were twin brothers
it gave me quite a shock the first time i saw his portrait said lupin
it was three years ago the day or rather the night of the first burglary at charmerace
it was i who pointed out the likeness to you
i said he s the very spit of you master
and you said there s something to be done with that charolais
and then off you started for the ice and snow and found the duke and became his friend and then he went and died not that you d have helped him to if he hadn t
with him a great name was about to be extinguished
he paused and looked at the clock
a quarter to eight he said hesitating
shall i telephone to sonia or shall i not
oh there s no hurry let the poor child sleep on
she must be worn out after that and that cursed guerchard s persecution yesterday
i ll dress first and telephone to her afterwards
i d better be getting dressed by the way
the work i ve got to do can t be done in pyjamas
i wish it could for bed s the place for me
my wits aren t quite as clear as i could wish them to deal with an awkward business like this
well i must do the best i can with them
he yawned and went to the bedroom leaving the on the table
bring my charolais and shave me he said pausing and he went into the bedroom and shut the door
ah said victoire sadly what a pity it is
a few years ago he would have gone to the crusades and he steals coronets
i think myself that the best thing we can do is to pack up our belongings said charolais
and i don t think we ve much time to do it either
this particular game is at an end you may take it from me
i hope to goodness it is i want to get back to the country said victoire
he took up the tray and they went out of the room
on the landing they separated she went upstairs and he went down
presently he came up with the shaving water and shaved his master for in the house in university street he discharged the double functions of valet and butler
he had just finished his task when there came a ring at the bell
you d better go and see who it is said lupin
bernard is answering the door said charolais
but perhaps i d better keep an eye on it myself one never knows
he put away the razor leisurely and went
on the stairs he found bonavent disguised in the livery and fierce moustache of a porter from the ritz
why didn t you come to the servants entrance said charolais with the truculent air of the servant of a duke and a stickler for his master s dignity
i didn t know that there was one said bonavent humbly
well you ought to have known that there was and it s plain enough to see
what is it you want said charolais
i ve brought a letter for the duke of charmerace said bonavent
no no i m to give it into the hands of the duke himself and to nobody else said bonavent
well in that case you ll have to wait till he s finished dressing said charolais
they went on up to the stairs into the
bonavent was walking straight into the
wait here said charolais quickly
bonavent sat down with a very stolid air and charolais looked at him doubtfully in two minds whether to leave him there alone or not
before he had decided there came a thundering knock on the front door not only loud but protracted
charolais looked round with a scared air and then ran out of the room and down the stairs
on the instant bonavent was on his feet and very far from stolid
he opened the door of the very gently and peered in
he slipped noiselessly across the room a pair of clippers ready in his hand and cut the wires of the telephone
his quick eye glanced round the room and fell on the on the table
he snatched it up and slipped it into the breast of his tunic
he had scarcely done button of his tunic was still to the bedroom door opened and lupin came out what do you want
he said sharply and his keen eyes scanned the porter with a disquieting penetration
i ve brought a letter to the duke of charmerace to be given into his own hands said bonavent in a disguised voice
give it to me said lupin holding out his hand
but the duke said bonavent hesitating
bonavent gave him the letter and turned to go
there was a faint glitter in his eyes but bonavent missed it
charolais came into the room and said in a grumbling tone a knock
they wouldn t go fetching me away from my work again in a hurry i can tell you
lupin opened the letter and read it
as he read it at first he frowned then he smiled and then he laughed joyously
it ran sir m guerchard has told me everything
with regard to sonia i have judged you a man who loves a thief can be nothing but a rogue
i have two pieces of news to announce to you the death of the duke of charmerace who died three years ago and my intention of becoming engaged to his cousin and heir de relzi√®res who will assume the title and the arms
she does write in shocking bad taste said lupin shaking his head sadly
charolais sit down and write a letter for me
it seems to be the fashion in financial circles and i am bound to follow it when a lady sets it
charolais went to the reluctantly sat down set a sheet of paper on the blotter took a pen in his hand and sighed painfully
ready said lupin and he dictated mademoiselle i have a very robust constitution and my indisposition will very soon be over
i shall have the honour of sending this afternoon my humble wedding present to the future madame de relzi√®res
for jacques de bartut marquis de relzi√®res prince of virieux duke of charmerace
shall i write ars√®ne said charolais in a horrified tone
it s your charming name isn t it
bonavent pricked up his ears and looked at charolais with a new interest
charolais shrugged his shoulders finished the letter blotted it put it in an envelope addressed it and handed it to lupin
take this to mademoiselle said lupin handing it to bonavent
bonavent took the letter turned and had taken one step towards the door when lupin sprang
his arm went round the detective s neck he jerked him backwards off his feet scragging him
he cried in a terrible voice and then he said quietly to charolais just take my out of this fellow s tunic
charolais with deft fingers ripped open the detective s tunic and took out the
this is what they call old chap
you ll be able to teach it to your colleagues said lupin
he loosed his grip on bonavent and knocked him straight with a thump in the back and sent him flying across the room
then he took the from charolais and made sure that its contents were untouched
tell your master from me that if he wants to bring me down he d better fire the gun himself said lupin contemptuously
show the gentleman out charolais
bonavent staggered to the door paused and turned on lupin a face livid with fury
he will be here himself in ten minutes he said
many thanks for the information said lupin quietly
the bargain charolais conducted the detective down the stairs and let him out of the front door cursing and threatening vengeance as he went
charolais took no notice of his was the servant
he came back upstairs and on the landing called to victoire and bernard
they came hurrying down and the three of them went into the
now we know where we are said lupin with cheerful briskness
guerchard will be here in ten minutes with a warrant for my arrest
the house is watched said charolais
and i ll bet it s watched back and front
well slip out by the secret entrance
they haven t found that yet said lupin
and meet me at the house at passy
charolais and bernard wanted no more telling they ran to the and pressed the buttons the slid aside the doors opened and disclosed the lift
in an instant i shall slip out the same way he said
you go on said victoire and the lift went down
lupin went to the telephone rang the bell and put the receiver to his ear
you ve no time to waste telephoning
if i don t telephone sonia will come here
she will run right into guerchard s arms
why the devil don t they answer
there really isn t any time to waste
i lost my head last night cried lupin suddenly anxious himself
she s at a little hotel near the star
but there are twenty hotels near the star
oh i did lose my head last night
here i m fighting with a piece of furniture
he picked up the machine shook it saw that the wires were cut and cried furiously ha
they ve played the telephone trick on me
but that s just what i can t do
but there s nothing more for you to do here since you can no longer telephone said victoire bewildered
lupin caught her arm and shook her staring into her face with eyes
but don t you understand that since i haven t telephoned she ll come here
his face had suddenly grown haggard this new fear had brought back all the exhaustion of the night his eyes were
but what about you said victoire wringing her hands
what about her said lupin and his voice thrilled with anguished dread
but you ll gain nothing by destroying both of at all
i prefer it said lupin slowly with a suddenly stubborn air
but they re coming to take you cried victoire gripping his arm
take me cried lupin freeing himself quietly from her grip
and he stood frowning plunged in deep thought weighing the chances the risks seeking a plan saving devices
he crossed the room to the opened a drawer and took out a cardboard box about eight inches square and set it on the table
they shall never take me alive he said gloomily
i know very well that you re capable of anything
they won t do anything to child like frail
no i m not said lupin stubbornly
oh well if you won t said victoire and with an air of resolution she went to the side of the and pressed the buttons
the doors closed the slid across
she sat down and folded her arms
what you re not going to stop here cried lupin
i m as fond of you as she know i am said victoire and her face set stonily obstinate
lupin begged her to go ordered her to go he seized her by the shoulder shook her and abused her like a pickpocket
he abandoned the effort sat down and knitted his brow again in profound and painful thought working out his plan
now and again his eyes flashed once or twice they twinkled
victoire watched his face with just the faintest hope on her own
it was past minutes to nine when the bell rang
they gazed at one another with an unspoken question on their lips
the eyes of victoire were scared but in the eyes of lupin the light of battle was gathering
it s her said victoire under her breath
he sprang to his feet with shining eyes
his lips were curved in a fighting smile
the game isn t lost yet he said in a tense quiet voice
i m going to play it to the end
i m still the duke of charmerace
go down and open the door for him
what you want me to said victoire in a shaky voice
when you have opened the door slip out of it and watch the house
stop her from entering her from entering
he spoke coolly but his voice shook on the last words
but if guerchard arrests me said victoire
when he comes in stand behind the door
he will be too eager to get to me to stop for you
besides for him you don t count in the game
once you re out of the house i ll hold him here half an hour
she should be here in twelve minutes
get her away to the house at passy
if i don t come keep her there she s to live with you
as he spoke he was pushing her towards the door
they were at the top of the stairs
and suppose he does arrest me said victoire breathlessly
never mind you must go all the same said lupin
i m going dearie said victoire and she went down the stairs steadily with a brave air
he watched her down the flight then he muttered if only she gets to sonia in time
he turned went into the and shut the door
he sat quietly down in an easy chair lighted a cigarette and took up a paper
he heard the noise of the traffic in the street grow louder as the front door was opened
there was a pause then he heard the door bang
there was the sound of a hasty footstep on the stairs the door flew open and guerchard bounced into the room
he stopped short in front of the door at the sight of lupin quietly reading smoking at his ease
he had expected to find the bird flown
he stood still hesitating shuffling his his doubts had returned and lupin smiled at him over the lowered paper
guerchard pulled himself together by a violent effort and said jerkily lupin
guerchard said lupin with an ambiguous smile and all the air of the duke of charmerace
i hope i haven t kept you waiting said guerchard with an air of bravado
no thank you the time has passed quite quickly
i have so much to do in the morning always said lupin
i hope you had a good night after that unfortunate business of the coronet
that was a disaster and so unexpected too
guerchard came a few steps into the room still hesitating you ve a very charming house here he said with a sneer
it s central said lupin carelessly
you must please excuse me if i can not receive you as i should like but all my servants have bolted
those confounded detectives of yours have frightened them away
i shall catch them said guerchard
if you do i m sure i wish you joy of them
do please keep your hat on said lupin with ironic politeness
guerchard came slowly to the middle of the room raising his hand to his hat letting it fall again without taking it off
he sat down slowly facing him and they gazed at one another with the wary eyes of duellists crossing swords at the beginning of a duel
did you get formery to sign a little warrant said lupin in a caressing tone full of quiet mockery
i did said guerchard through his teeth
and have you got it on you said lupin
against lupin or against the duke of charmerace said lupin
against lupin called charmerace said guerchard
well that ought to cover me pretty well
what are you waiting for said lupin
his face was entirely serene his eyes were careless his tone indifferent
i m not waiting for anything said guerchard thickly but it gives me such pleasure that i wish to enjoy this minute to the utmost lupin said guerchard and his eyes gloated on him
lupin himself said lupin smiling
i hardly dare believe it said guerchard
you re quite right not to said lupin
yes said guerchard in a decisive tone
and ever so much more than you think
he bent forwards towards him with his hands on his knees and said do you know where sonia kritchnoff is at this moment what said lupin sharply
i ask if you know where sonia kritchnoff is said guerchard slowly lingering over the words
i do said guerchard triumphantly
where is she said lupin in a tone of utter incredulity
the hotel has a telephone and you can make sure said guerchard
what s the number of it said lupin in a mocking tone
central would you like to telephone to her said guerchard and he smiled triumphantly at the disabled instrument
lupin shock his head with a careless smile and said why should i telephone to her
nothing that s all said guerchard
and he leant back in his chair with an ugly smile on his face
for after all what has that child got to do with you
you re not interested in her plainly
she s not big enough game for you
i ve played you tricks enough for that you old scoundrel
so you re going to leave that child in peace
you re not going to revenge yourself on her
it s all very well for you to be a policeman it s all very well for you to hate me but there are things one does not do
there was a ring of menace and appeal in the deep ringing tones of his voice
you re not going to do that guerchard
he gazed at the detective with fierce appealing eyes
that depends on you said guerchard curtly
on me cried lupin in genuine surprise
yes i ve a little bargain to propose to you said guerchard
have you said lupin and his watchful face was serene again his smile almost pleasant
well what is it you want said lupin
i offer you offer me cried lupin
reassure yourself said guerchard coldly
to you personally i offer nothing
then you are sincere said lupin
and putting me out of the question
you care only for a single person in the world
i hold you through her sonia kritchnoff
lupin burst into a ringing irrepressible laugh why you re trying to blackmail me you old sweep
if you like to call it so said guerchard coldly
lupin rose and walked backwards and forwards across the room frowning calculating glancing keenly at guerchard weighing him
he stopped and said coldly so be it
for the moment you re the stronger
but you offer me this child s liberty
that s my offer said guerchard and his eyes brightened at the prospect of success
on your word of honour said lupin and he had something of the air of a cat playing with a mouse
on my word of honour said guerchard
can you do it said lupin with a sudden air of doubt and he looked sharply from guerchard to the clock
i undertake to do it said guerchard confidently
but how said lupin looking at him with an expression of the gravest doubt
oh i ll put the thefts on your shoulders
that will let her out all right said guerchard
i ve certainly good broad shoulders said lupin with a bitter smile
he walked slowly up and down with an air that grew more and more depressed it was almost the air of a beaten man
then he stopped and faced guerchard and said and what is it you want in exchange
everything said guerchard with the air of a man who is winning
you must give me back the pictures tapestry renaissance cabinets the coronet and all the information about the death of the duke of charmerace
if ever i commit suicide you ll know all about it my good guerchard
you may even join me said lupin grimly he resumed his pacing up and down the room
done for yes i shall be done for he said presently
yes i want your skin said guerchard in a low savage vindictive tone
my skin said lupin thoughtfully
think of that girl said guerchard in a fresh access of uneasy anxiety
lupin laughed i can give you a glass of port he said but i m afraid that s all i can do for you
i ll throw victoire in said guerchard
there was a ring of utter dismay almost despair in his tone
i won t bother with her said guerchard eagerly
let me think said lupin hoarsely and he strove to adjust his jostling ideas to meet with a fresh plan this fresh disaster
he stood listening with all his ears
there were footsteps on the stairs and the door opened
i accept everything cried lupin in a frantic tone
it s a tradesman am i to detain him said dieusy
you told me to let you know who came and take instructions
then i refuse cried lupin in an ecstasy of relief
no you needn t keep him said guerchard to dieusy
dieusy went out and shut the door
i m going to gaol that girl said guerchard savagely and he took a step towards the door
not for long said lupin quietly
she ll furnish the proof all right of proofs said guerchard brutally
what chance has a silly child like that got when we really start questioning her
a delicate creature like that will crumple up before the end of the third day s
you know well enough that i can do my a feeble child like that and you know your code five years is the minimum said guerchard in a tone of relentless brutality watching him carefully sticking to his hope
by jove i could wring your neck
by a violent effort he controlled himself and said thoughtfully after all if i give up everything to you i shall be free to take it back one of these days
oh no doubt when you come out of prison said guerchard ironically and he laughed a grim jeering laugh
i ve got to go to prison first said lupin quietly
pardon you accept i mean to arrest you said guerchard
manifestly you ll arrest me if you can said lupin
and again his voice quivered with anxiety
and he paused as if finally weighing the matter
well said guerchard and his voice shook
said lupin and he laughed a mocking laugh
you won t said guerchard between his teeth
this is just a ruse said lupin in quiet measured tones
at bottom you don t care a hang about sonia mademoiselle kritchnoff
and then if you did you have no proofs
as for the pendant you d have to prove it
you can t prove that it was in her possession one moment
he paused and then went on in the same quiet tone no guerchard after having kept out of your clutches for the last ten years i m not going to be caught to save this child who is not even in danger
she has a very useful friend in the duke of charmerace
guerchard stared at him scowling biting his lips seeking a fresh point of attack
for the moment he knew himself baffled but he still clung tenaciously to the struggle in which victory would be so precious
there s a lot of ringing at your bell this morning said guerchard under his breath and hope sprang afresh in him
again they stood silent waiting
dieusy opened the door put in his head and said it s mademoiselle kritchnoff
shouted guerchard with savage triumphant joy
cried lupin frantically and he sprang like a tiger at guerchard
guerchard jumped to the other side of the table
lupin gripped the edge of the table with both hands and stood panting grinding his teeth pale with fury
he stood silent and motionless for perhaps half a minute gazing at guerchard with burning murderous eyes
let mademoiselle kritchnoff wait said guerchard with a sigh of deep relief
now let us settle exactly how we stand said lupin in a clear incisive voice
the bargain is this if i give you the pictures the tapestry the cabinets the coronet and the of the duke of charmerace you give me your word of honour that mademoiselle kritchnoff shall not be touched
that s it said guerchard eagerly
once i deliver these things to you mademoiselle kritchnoff passes out of the game
if i get back i goes said lupin
yes said guerchard and his eyes were shining
on your word of honour said lupin
very well said lupin in a quiet businesslike voice
to begin with here in this you ll find all the documents relating to the death of the duke of charmerace
in it you will also find the receipt of the plantin furniture repository at batignolles for the objects of art which i collected at s
i sent them to batignolles because in my letters asking the owners of valuables to forward them to me i always make batignolles the place to which they are to be sent therefore i knew that you would never look there
they are all in cases for while you were making those valuable inquiries yesterday my men were putting them into cases
you ll not find the receipt in the name of either the duke of charmerace or my own
it is in the name of a respected proprietor of batignolles a pierre servien
but he has lately left that charming suburb and i do not think he will return to it
guerchard almost snatched the out of his hand
he verified the documents in it with greedy eyes and then he put them back in it and stuffed it into the of his coat
and where s the coronet he said in an excited voice
you re nearly standing on it said lupin
it s in that at your feet on the top of the change of clothes in it
guerchard snatched up the opened it and took out the coronet
i m afraid i haven t the case said lupin in a tone of regret
if you remember i left it at your charge
guerchard examined the coronet carefully
he looked at the stones in it he weighed it in his right hand and he weighed it in his left
are you sure it s the real one said lupin in a tone of acute but affected anxiety
do do not let us have any more of these painful mistakes about it
is the real one said guerchard with another deep sigh of relief
well have you done bleeding me said lupin contemptuously
your arms said guerchard quickly
they weren t in the bond said lupin
and he threw his revolver on the table
guerchard picked it up and put it into his pocket
he looked at lupin as if he could not believe his eyes gloating over him
then he said in a deep triumphant tone
chapter xxiii the end of the duel the handcuffs said lupin and his face fell
then it cleared and he added lightly after all there s nothing like being careful and by jove with me you need to be
what luck it is for you that i m so soft so little of a charmerace so human
truly i can t be much of a man of the world to be in love like this
come come hold out your hands said guerchard jingling the handcuffs impatiently
i should like to see that child for the last time said lupin gently
said lupin bitterly and he held out his wrists
guerchard snapped the handcuffs on them with a grunt of satisfaction
lupin gazed down at them with a bitter face and said oh you are in luck
you re not married by any chance
yes yes i am said guerchard hastily and he went quickly to the door and opened it dieusy
mademoiselle kritchnoff is at liberty
tell her so and bring her in here
lupin started back flushed and scowling he cried with these things on my hands
guerchard stood still looking at him
lupin s scowl slowly softened and he said half to himself but i should have liked to see her very much for if she goes like that
i shall not know when or he stopped short raised his eyes and said in a decided tone ah well yes i should like to see her
if you ve quite made up your mind said guerchard impatiently and he went into the anteroom
lupin stood very still frowning thoughtfully
he heard footsteps on the stairs and then the voice of guerchard in the anteroom saying in a jeering tone you re free mademoiselle and you can thank the duke for it
and i owe it to him cried the voice of sonia ringing and golden with extravagant joy
yes mademoiselle said guerchard
she came through the open door flushed deliciously and smiling her eyes brimming with tears of joy
lupin had never seen her look half so adorable
then i shall owe everything to you
she cried holding out her hands to him
lupin half turned away from her to hide his handcuffs
her face fell suddenly like that of a child rebuked oh i was wrong
she cried quickly in changed dolorous tones
lupin was looking at her over his shoulder standing sideways to hide the handcuffs
she cried quickly cutting him short
and yet if you only you knew how i have what a changed spirit i came here
ah i swear that now i hate all my past
i swear that now the mere presence of a thief would overwhelm me with disgust
hush said lupin flushing deeply and wincing
but after all you re right she said in a gentler voice
one can t wipe out what one has done
if i were to give back everything i ve i were to spend years in remorse and repentance it would be no use
in your eyes i should always be sonia kritchnoff the thief
the great tears welled slowly out of her eyes and rolled down her cheeks she let them stream unheeded
she broke out with fresh vehemence a feverish passion and yet if i d been a thief like so many others
i m not trying to defend myself but after all i did it to keep honest and when i loved you it was not the heart of a thief that thrilled it was the heart of a poor girl who loved that s all who loved
you don t know what you re doing
cried lupin hoarsely beside himself
i m going we shall never see one another any more she sobbed
but will you will you shake hands just for the last time
you won t wailed sonia in a heartrending tone
last night if you were going to let me go like this last night
it was wrong she wailed and turned to go
a moment ago you said something
you said that the mere presence of a thief would overwhelm you with disgust
guerchard appeared in the doorway
and if i were not the man you believe said lupin sombrely
what said sonia and a faint bewilderment mingled with her grief
if i were not the duke of charmerace not the duke if i were not an honest man said lupin
if i ars√®ne lupin jeered guerchard from the door
lupin turned and held out his manacled wrists for her to see
but then but then it must be for my sake that you ve given yourself up
and it s for me you re going to prison
she sprang to him threw her arms round his neck and pressed her lips to his
and that s what women call repenting said guerchard
he shrugged his shoulders went out on to the landing and called to the policeman in the hall to bid the driver of the which was waiting bring it up to the door
cried lupin in a trembling voice and he kissed sonia s lips and eyes and hair
to think that you love me enough to go on loving me in spite of spite of the fact that i m ars√®ne lupin
oh after this i ll become an honest man
cried lupin and he kissed her again and again
guerchard came back into the room
he looked at them with a cynical grin and said time s up
oh guerchard after so many others i owe you the best minute of my life
bonavent still in his porter s livery came hurrying through the anteroom master he cried i ve found it
it opens into that little side street
we haven t got the door open yet but we soon shall
the last link in the chain said guerchard with warm satisfaction
but he s going to take you away
cried sonia in a sudden anguish of realization
it s all the same to me now cried lupin in the voice of a conqueror
i m not going to prison said lupin in a low voice
stop and talk to victoire condole with her
if they turn you out of the house wait close to the front door
come mademoiselle said guerchard
go sonia said lupin and he kissed her
she went quietly out of the room her handkerchief to her eyes
guerchard held open the door for her and kept it open with his hand still on the handle he said to lupin come along
lupin yawned stretched himself and said coolly my dear guerchard what i want after the last two nights is
he walked quickly across the room and stretched himself comfortably at full length on the couch
come get up said guerchard roughly
that ought to fetch you out of your dream
really you do say the most unlucky things said lupin gaily
he had resumed his flippant air his voice rang as lightly and pleasantly as if he had not a care in the world
do you mean that you refuse to come cried guerchard in a rough threatening tone
oh no said lupin quickly and he rose
no said lupin after all it s too early
once more he stretched himself out on the couch and added languidly i m lunching at the english embassy
if you re snatching at a last straw it s waste of time
understand you rogue i know them
you know them said lupin with a smile rising
he stood before guerchard twisting his hands and wrists curiously
half a dozen swift movements and he held out his handcuffs in one hand and threw them on the floor
did you know that trick guerchard
one of these days i shall teach you to invite me to lunch he said slowly in a mocking tone and he gazed at the detective with menacing dangerous eyes
come come we ve had enough of this
cried guerchard in mingled astonishment anger and alarm
now listen guerchard and understand that i m not humbugging said lupin quickly in clear compelling tones
if sonia just now had had one word one gesture of contempt for me i d have given at any rate for rather than fall into your triumphant clutches i d have blown my brains out
i ve now to choose between happiness life with sonia or prison
i will live happy with her or else my dear guerchard i ll die with you
now let your men m ready for them
guerchard ran to the door and shouted again
i think the fat s in the fire now said lupin laughing
he sprang to the table opened the cardboard box whipped off the top layer of and took out a shining bomb
he sprang to the wall pressed the button the bookshelf glided slowly to one side the lift rose to the level of the floor and its doors flew open just as the detectives rushed in
cried lupin in a terrible voice raising his right hand high above his head
come and collar me now you swine
you silly funks roared guerchard
do you think he d dare come and see cried lupin
as one man his detectives threw themselves upon him
three of them gripped his arms a fourth gripped him round the waist and they all shouted at him together not to be a madman
he sprang forward caught up the in his left hand and tossed it behind him into the lift
oh why isn t there a photographer here
and now guerchard you thief give me back my
never screamed guerchard struggling with his men purple with fury
do you want me to smash up the whole lot
roared lupin in a furious terrible voice
do i look as if i were bluffing you fools let him have his way master
come come it s got to be given to him cried bonavent
and he thrust his hand into the breast of guerchard s coat and tore out the
bonavent threw it on to the table and it slid along it right to lupin
he caught it in his left hand and slipped it into his pocket
and then he yelled ferociously look out for the bomb and made a feint of throwing it
the whole group fell back with an odd unanimous sighing groan
lupin sprang into the lift and the doors closed over the opening
there was a great sigh of relief from the frightened detectives and then the chunking of machinery as the lift sank
their grip on guerchard loosened
he shook himself free and shouted after him
down into the cellars some of you
others go to the secret entrance
others to the servants entrance
the others ran out of the room and down the stairs but with no great heartiness since their minds were still quite full of the bomb and lupin still had it with him
guerchard and dieusy dashed at the doors of the opening of the pulling and wrenching at them
suddenly there was a click and they heard the grunting of the machinery
there was a little bump and a jerk the doors flew open of themselves and there was the lift empty ready for them
they jumped into it guerchard s quick eye caught the button and he pressed it
the doors banged to and to his horror the lift shot upwards about eight feet and stuck between the floors
as the lift stuck a second compartment exactly like the one guerchard and dieusy were in came up to the level of the floor of the the doors opened and there was lupin
the clothes of the duke of charmerace littered the floor the was open and he was wearing the very clothes of guerchard his seedy his cloak
he wore also guerchard s sparse lank black hair his little bristling black moustache
his figure hidden by the cloak seemed to have shrunk to the size of guerchard s
he sat before a mirror in the wall of the lift a box on the seat beside him
he darkened his eyebrows and put a line or two about his eyes
that done he looked at himself earnestly for two or three minutes and as he looked a truly marvellous transformation took place the features of ars√®ne lupin of the duke of charmerace decomposed actually decomposed into the features of jean guerchard
he looked at himself and laughed the gentle husky laugh of guerchard
he rose transferred the to the coat he was wearing picked up the bomb came out into the and listened
a muffled roaring thumping came from the well of the lift
it almost sounded as if in their exasperation guerchard and dieusy were engaged in a struggle to the death
smiling pleasantly he stole to the window and looked out
his eyes brightened at the sight of the guerchard s car waiting just before the front door and in charge of a policeman
he stole to the head of the stairs and looked down into the hall
victoire was sitting huddled together on a chair sonia stood beside her talking to her in a low voice and keeping guard on victoire stood a active nervous policeman all alertness briskness keenness
be smart cried lupin over the bannisters in the husky gentle voice of guerchard
the policeman looked up recognized the great detective and came bounding zealously up the stairs
lupin led the way through the anteroom into the
then he said sharply you have your revolver
you re not to use it on any account
yes said the policeman firmly and with a slightly bewildered air he put the revolver away
and he caught the policeman s arm and hustled him roughly to the front of the doors of the
yes yes said the policeman glaring at them
they re the doors of a lift said lupin
in that lift are dieusy and lupin
there are only dieusy and lupin in the lift
you can hear them shouted lupin in the policeman s ear
you and a disguised man are in the lift
directly the lift descends and the doors open throw yourself on him
he almost bellowed the last words into the policeman s ear
and he braced himself before the doors of the gazing at them with harried eyes as if he expected them to bite him
be ready to die in the discharge of your duty
bellowed lupin and he walked out of the room shut the door and turned the key
the policeman stood listening to the noise of the struggle in the lift himself strung up to fighting point he was panting
lupin s instructions were whirling and dancing in his head
lupin went quietly down the stairs
victoire and sonia saw him coming
victoire rose and as he came to the bottom of the stairs sonia stepped forward and said in an anxious pleading voice oh guerchard where is he
he s here said lupin in his natural voice
sonia sprang to him with outstretched arms
just look how like him i am said lupin laughing triumphantly
but do i look quite ruffian enough
isn t he a wonder said victoire
this time the duke of charmerace is dead for good and all said lupin
no it s lupin that s dead said sonia softly
it would be a terrible loss you loss for france said lupin gravely
said lupin in a wondering tone and he put his arm round her and kissed her violently
and you won t steal any more said sonia holding him back with both hands on his shoulders looking into his eyes
i shouldn t dream of such a thing said lupin
what more could i possibly desire
his voice softened and grew infinitely caressing as he went on yet when you are at my side i shall always have the soul of a lover and the soul of a thief
i long to steal your kisses your thoughts the whole of your heart
ah sonia if you want me to steal nothing else you have only to stay by my side
sonia drew herself out of his arms and cried but we re wasting time
i did flying enough last night to last me a lifetime
for the rest of my life i m going to like a snail
but come along you two i must take you to the
he opened the front door and they came out on the steps
the policeman in charge of the car saluted
lupin paused and said softly hark
i hear the sound of wedding bells
even as they were getting into the car some chance blow of guerchard or dieusy struck a hidden spring and released the lift
it sank to the level of lupin s and stopped
the doors flew open dieusy and guerchard sprang out of it and on the instant the nervous policeman sprang actively on guerchard and pinned him
taken by surprise guerchard yelled loudly you stupid idiot
somehow entangled his legs in those of his captor and they rolled on the floor
dieusy surveyed them for a moment with blank astonishment
then with swift intelligence grasped the fact that the policeman was lupin in disguise
he sprang upon them tore them asunder fell heavily on the policeman and pinned him to the floor with a strangling hand on his throat
guerchard dashed to the door tried it and found it locked dashed for the window threw it open and thrust out his head
forty yards down the street a was rolling smoothly to a honeymoon
